"Fast & Furious","SnoopyStyle","23 February 2014","Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have escaped to the Dominican Republic and resume their criminal ways. However when the cops close in on Dom, he decides to leave everything behind including Letty. Later he finds that Letty has been killed while working for drug baron Braga who is using street racers to drive his drugs across the border. Only he doesn't know that Letty was working for Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) as an informant. Now Dom and Brian are both trying to get Braga by infiltrating his group as drivers.The family is back and the movie is so much the better for it. Director Justin Lin returns after Tokyo Drift. The franchise really missed the presence of Vin Diesel. The only minor disappointment are the car chases. They're good but just not great. They can be better. It's also sad to lose Letty so early on in the movie. It misses her energy.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","ivo-cobra8","18 October 2015","Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares? It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules!""Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy."" This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was. This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). The rating I am giving to this film is 9. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that are getting high scores.)","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","claudio_carvalho","12 December 2009","When Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is informed that his beloved Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was assassinated, he returns to Los Angeles to find the murderer. Meanwhile, his former friend and FBI agent Brian Conner (Paul Walker) is assigned to capture the mysterious drug lord Braga that is looking for replacement drivers, working undercover as his courier, driving from Mexico to USA through the desert. Dom discovers that Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed and he decides to join his gang to find the killer. Their lives entwine substantiating their friendship and Brian dates Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) again. But they need to find the true identity of Braga. ""Fast & Furious"" is a great adventure and an excellent entertainment as good as the first movie of this franchise. The chemistry between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is amazing performing very likable characters. The talented Jordana Brewster is for me one of the most (if not the most) gorgeous actresses of her generation and I look forward to see her works. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Velozes e Furiosos 4"" (""Fast and Furious 4"")","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","ccthemovieman-1","19 August 2009","This is one of these 107-minute testosterone movies guys crave every once in awhile, some more than others. Being a somewhat-old guy, I don't look as these as often anymore but every once in awhile it's fun to kick back and just watch fast cars, loose women, wild action and fairly-brainless film.There isn't much of a plot but my guess is people who are fans of this film series don't care. Just give us the above - muscle cars, macho men, sexy babes and a few great chase scenes - and that's all that is asked. I thought the best scene was the first one, a chase down mountain in the Dominican Republic. That was like a James Bond opening scene: a real attention-getter.After that, you get the normal F&F material, which glamorizes things that shouldn't be (racing through crowded streets, etc.) but also has the ""good"" guys going to capture a drug lord from Mexico.....and a lot of punks along the way. They all sneer and have a lot of tattoos. I've only seen this one and the first in the series but from what I read here, I've seen the two best of the four Fast & Furious films. Vin Diesel helps make them a notch above the others, I suspect. He's always interesting as ""Dom Toretto"" and his character is the most credible.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","C-Younkin","31 March 2009","Fast and Furious, or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count, is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona, and considering he's been doing movies like ""Babylon AD"" and ""The Pacifier"" for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time.The plot is pretty thin but I'm sure for fans of the first movie it will be nice to see the two leads back playing their roles. Diesel reprises wanted felon Dom Toretto, who after escaping at the end of the first movie seems to have started a new life in the Dominican Republic knocking over trucks. What brings him back to Los Angeles is revenge for the death of his girlfriend (Michelle Rodriguez) at the hands of brutal drug dealers led by Braga. This brings him face to face with the man who infiltrated his gang in the first flick, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), now an FBI agent going after the same drug dealers. And wouldn't you know that driving plays a big part in Braga's whole smuggling operation so both Brian and Dom team up, amidst some trust issues, to bring down the drug cartel.Hopefully director Justin Lin (""Tokyo Drift"") gets the credit he deserves this time around. He's fantastic with these action sequences, not only making them pulse-pounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you're in the car with these characters. The movie starts out brilliantly with a propane truck hi-jacking that turns life or death when things get out of control and the truck barrels down on the hi-jackers, and then just continues to go full throttle, staging a race on a crowded Los Angeles street and then chases in an underground tunnel shaft. Once these characters get in their cars you won't be bored for a moment.Outside the car is a different matter though. Both actors do what they can. Diesel is adrenaline personified. With his gravelly voice, bulging biceps, and cool, playful way around a line of dialogue, he's a lot of fun to watch. And while still pretty wooden, I admit that Walker has a pretty-boy face and an athletic physicality that makes him a good hero. This pairing worked well in the first movie, sort of like an amateur, yet entertaining, version of the adrenaline-seeking- cop and criminal formula a la ""Point Break."" Just after four movies it's all gotten stale and it's easy to see that the cars are the real stars here. The Dom-Brian conflict and Dom's vendetta against the cartel is mostly overshadowed and there isn't much for either character to do when away from their vehicles. Diesel and Walker try but they always seem to be a couple wheels short of competing with the four-wheel drive.""Fast and Furious"" deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it's a disappointment, but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie, making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","disdressed12","24 April 2011","i thought this prequel to Tokyo Drift was actually not bad.it starts off with a real adrenaline rush.the racing scenes are pretty good,as are the chase scenes.the story was good,and flowed well.there are quite a few dramatic moments in this film and they all work well.most of the original actors form the first film in the series are back,including Vin Diesel,Jordana Brewster Michele Rodriguez,and Paul Walker.i don't think it was as good as the first film,but it was a close second.i added it to my collection,and don't regret it.if you're a fan of the series,you should like this one.for me,Fast & Furious is a well deserved 7/10","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","masonsaul","26 July 2019","Once again, it follows the same plot points as some of the previous installments but Fast and Furious is still fun and its beginning to embrace the ridiculousness. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances and it's nice to see them back in the same film. John Ortiz is a really good villain. The action and car chases are also really good as usual.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","Robert_duder","12 July 2009","So what is Fast and Furious? It's not a remake, or a reboot, and although it would appear to be a sequel it really is ultimately a recap to the very first film...or the second I forget. It has been so long since I've seen the original two films which this one is a direct follow up to. I kind of wish I had watched the first two before seeing this because it may have helped with the overall characters and plot. They do still try to link together not just the first two films but all the movies which I give them kudos for because I actually thoroughly enjoyed Tokyo Drift. So here comes Fast and Furious, barely changing the title from the first one but bringing back the original cast that defined the series. The thing that caught me the most about this film is it is not about car racing anymore. Really the film is about drug trafficking and despite a huge car/truck stunt in the first scene Fast and Furious lacks much of anything fast at all. All the other installments of the series have focused on the cars and the sexy sleek speed of everything but Fast and Furious tries to turn that around by giving it a different edge.Vin Diesel thrives in a Fast and Furious movie like this one or it's predecessors. It even brings out a little bit of actor in him. This is part of the reason I think he has trouble staying afloat in other films because he is Dominic Toretto. They really try to give him some depth in this installment which works okay but you really just want to see him race. I'm not sure he can do much else outside these movies. Paul Walker...remember when he was the IT boy? He returns to his role as tainted Federal Agent Brian O'Connor. Diesel and Walker still have oddly good chemistry together and they work better together as a crime fighting team then racing adversaries. Walker is not much different than he is ever been and just kind of looks pretty and does the bare minimum to stay afloat. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez return to their roles in the film very briefly, enough to say they were there but give very little extra to the plot or their characters other than a little bit of sexual tension between Brewster and Walker who are like the power couple of the series. The villain of the film is played by John Ortiz and does a very solid job. If only the heroes of the film had the same depth this movie could have been as good as it's previous installments.Some people feel that the entire Fast and The Furious franchise is simply about cars and hot stars and if that is the only thing that holds this together and makes you want to see it than I suppose you won't be remotely disappointed in this one. The hot faces and cars are still there but without the same level of the street racing that the earlier one focused on. The only issue with this film is that they don't work on the existing characters at all. It's like they take the exact same characters from the first movie and port them into this movie with no continuation of them or growth to them. Diesel and Walker just feel very empty and you keep waiting for more of them. Fortunately the action and the work of director Justin Lin who has previously proved with mainstream films like Tokyo Drift and Annapolis that he can tell a great story without a lot of fluff or frills. There is nothing wrong with Fast and Furious except that it feels rushed and slapped together. It is very impressive that they were able to bring back everyone from the original film for the most part. Fans of the series will likely still be impressed. 7/10","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","taylorkingston","26 April 2015","I was honestly so happy when this movie happened. I am a huge fan of The Fast And The Furious, and sadly, 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift, did not meet my expectations. I just thought they changed too much. This movie brings everyone back, and the story goes back to where it was born and where it made fans love the sport of drag racing even more. This movie is pretty much about Dominic Toretto. He's a street racer and a thief, who is still wanted by the law and other criminals. He decides it's safer to cut himself off from everyone in his life, including his sister, Mia and his girlfriend, Letty. But after Letty is killed, things need to change. Brian O'Conner, Dominic's old friend, turned rival, turned friend, is still working at the FBI and decides that he'll help Dom get answers about Letty's death. They go undercover to uncover a drug-smuggler, who just happens to be connected to Letty.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","g-bodyl","19 March 2010","Fast and Furious is another great addition to the already great series of these movies. This movie picks up after 2 Fast 2 Furious which came out six years before this. I am really happy to see the original cast back in the film. These four people are what made this series successful(at least the first one).Toretto and O'Conner must rejoin forces in order to bring down a gang that killed a loved one of Toretto.I don't see what other people seem to see. This move has a great, emotion-driven plot. As sequel after sequel comes out, it seems like the plot has gotten better with all the car racing an afternote.I really liked the acting in this film. Vin Diesel is one of my favorite actors. I was nice to see Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez after eight years. They still look good.Overall, this is a wonderful movie. I liked the action and the drama. I rate this film 9/10.","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","kairingler","8 July 2013","with these movies coming out to the theatre every other year now, and now I just looked on this site fast n furious 7 2014. I need to catch up with the series. Paul Walker returns with Vin Diesel along with Michelle rodriguez for #4. there are a lot more bad guys in this film I thought the idea of the Mexican drug cartel presented a few new ideas. there is lot's of action to be had here, the gasoline tanker's explosion,, the chases with all of the cars in the Mexican tunnels, with the chopper in pursuit of all of the vehicles. I like the idea of using the border as a character in the movie. because apparently you can only be tracked for so long either before or after you get across the border, I forget how that works. but there is lot's of good one liners in here for our characters to chew up, love all of the fast cars and the faster women,, although I wonder how many of these movies can they keep making,, don't get me wrong I like them very much, but at some point you have to sit back and say , I think we need something else.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","26 May 2014","After two films that strayed away from the very first that made the franchise popular, producers to The Fast and the Furious (2001) decided to finally bring back the original cast and big name stars. That was one of their best decisions that have been made. It's baffling to why they thought changing the cast would really benefit them in any way. All it does is create resent and a disconnect with the new characters. Fans don't appreciate that. However, this is not the only difference brought to this ongoing series. The original cast returns but the story changes. Oh yes, there's still an abundance racing cars but it's for a different reason.The story reunites Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) again to help in the arrest of a Cartel who is secretly making drug shipments in and out of the border of Mexico. However, these events only happen under very coincidental circumstances. The writer behind this installment is Chris Morgan, the same man behind The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). Morgan's writing is articulated in a way that still incorporates racing but it's no longer about who's packing nitro next to their driver's seat anymore. That part, fans should enjoy and this is really its strongest element. However, what Morgan still can't accomplish is a narrative that is cohesive enough that makes sense in its continuity. Just why exactly was Tokyo Drift (2006) made if they planned on making a prequel to it 3 years later?Also, the character of Brian O'Conner is getting a tad redundant. He still lies and he drops the FBI after 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), but now is working for the FBI of L.A. And this would be fine and all if he would stop being such a rule breaker. O'Conner just can't seem to follow the rules he swore to uphold. Why doesn't he just stop working for the FBI - it doesn't benefit him. Thankfully, O'Conner no longer has a love interest problem. He's stuck with Mia and that's it. Character wise, there aren't much of any new appearances except for the antagonists. Toretto is back along with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodgriguez) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). The only character that makes a subtle change is Paul Walker at which most girls will think he's the next heartthrob. Instead of having wavy surfer hair and wearing casual clothing, he now has a tux and a straight crew cut. Yeah, I could see why.The action is still fierce too. Instead of collaborating frequently on the town alleyways, the driving sequences also expand to broader horizons with larger landscapes and less tar. It'll give the audience something new to look at instead of the neon high beams and flashing traffic lights. The special effects also conform well to their surroundings; nothing looks out of place. Lastly, the franchise has finally found a solid contender to compose a score and that is Brian Tyler. During some very sentimental scenes, Tyler is able to emphasize those moments with the right emotion. Yet, Tyler is still lacking a distinctive theme for this franchise, which is a shame. He is an accomplished composer. Overall, a better sequel than the last two.With the original cast back and a story that involves more than just fast cars, this installment starts to resurrect what it had going for it from the start. Its continuity nonetheless is a totally different issue that still needs addressing.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","Bruce722","5 June 2013","Fast and Furious was a very good movie that had a darker and more serious tone than any of the prior films in the franchise. I loved seeing almost the entire original cast return and the amazing cars and impressive special effects that are a staple of the series return once again... granted, with a reduced emphasis on the cars themselves. The only real problem I had was that the continuity was broken a bit. *SPOILERS* Why, for example, is Paul Walker back in LA after the ending of 2 Fast 2 Furious? What happened to Tyrese's character? What happened to the rest of the crew from the original movie? These are not huge complaints but they did take away from the experience a bit. It's also evident that this film is a prequel to Tokyo Drift which was a little weird. Nonetheless, great film that is probably better than any of the prior ones other than the first of course.","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","callanvass","14 March 2014","Brian O'Conner is now working for the FBI on a thin leash, with no room for error. When Dom finds out that Letty was murdered, he sets all his morals aside to catch the people responsible. Not only that, but Dom is forced to accept help from the man who betrayed his trust, Brian O'Conner. I've seen this movie three times now, and it never fails to entertain me. After two sequels that weren't up to par with the first movie, they went all out to make sure this franchise was back on track. What better way to revitalize the series than with the return of Vin Diesel. He had a brief cameo at the end of Tokyo Drift, but this was his first movie since the first. I wouldn't call the plot fantastic or anything, but it definitely has more story to it than usual (IMO).The stakes are much higher emotionally. There are some legitimately good twists and turns in this movie as well. But we all know why we watch these movies, the action. Let me just say that they won't disappoint you. There are some exhilarating action sequences in this movie that don't give you time to breath. The opening scene is spectacular and the finale is excellent as well. It keeps the formula of fast cars, hot women, hunky guys, and rap music. I do have to say the action looked far more professional, continuing this trend in 5 & 6. My only carp about the action, is some shaky camera work at times. This is especially noticeable during an exciting foot race between Walker and a criminal. The performances won't win any Oscars, but they are a lot of fun to watch. Paul Walker's maturity shows as an actor at this juncture. He always had presence, but his performance is rock solid in this one. Vin Diesel isn't that great at emotion. He doesn't really do much when it comes to Letty's death like he should have, but he has plenty of charisma and screen presence. It was fun to see him paired with Walker once again. That p******s called Corona that you drink has gotta go though, bro. Craft beer is much tastier. Jordana Brewster does fine with what she had to do, but I felt her storyline with Walker wasn't explored enough. Michelle Rodriguez plays her part adequately as Letty. She had a jail term to serve, so I imagine that's why she was killed off. The villains are pretty weak in this one. They weren't that menacing in my opinion. The ending does a great job of jerking emotions from you. I have to give it creditThis is the definition of popcorn entertainment. If you want a thought provoking film, look elsewhere. If you want over a 100 minutes of exciting action that will make you go ""F yeah!"" this is your ticket. Action junkies will love this one. I know I did!8/10","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","trashgang","26 September 2013","Towards the end of Tokyo Drift (2006) we saw a Vin Diesel returning. People were eager to wait if he really was coming back and he finally did here in number 4. And it do returns to the end of part 2. They only mention Tokyo once at the beginning with Han (Sung Kang) but none of the other actors from that part are here to see except for Han.A return in fact to part 1 with Vin Diesel (Dominic Torreto) and Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) in the main lead. The are teaming again together. From that moment we do see a classic Fast and Furious. Full of fast cars and chasing cars and of course here and there some nice chicks. The story was solid and gave people really what they want and not going to deep into the technical details of the cars like the first part or with clichés. Still, this is not for everybody but people who really love action with fast cars and a simple solid story they should pick up this franchise.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5","7/10"

Dominic discovers that Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed and he decides to join his gang to find the killer......After the awful third movie, and the waning careers of the two leads, it was inevitable that this was eventually going to happen, and even though its lots and lots of fun, its bonkers beyond belief.Films like this are critic proof, they are all about fast cars, explosions, hot women and cool locations. Pretty much like a Michael Bay movie, but with taste.Diesel and Walker are not the best actors around, but their chemistry is undeniable, and they make a great pair. As with all sequels, they try to be bigger and better than the last one, and here it succeeds, because Lin knows these movies are ridiculous, so makes every set piece ridiculous also.So all in all, its a fine movie, totally off its rockers, but it knows it, and embraces it.","7/10"

"Fast & Furious","zardoz-13","30 April 2011","High-octane driving, treacherous villains, challenging predicaments and life and death stakes fuel the fourth entry in ""The Fast and the Furious"" film franchise. This fast-wheels and sexy-sirens series spun out of control after the Dom-less sophomore entry ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" then regained momentary traction with ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift."" Nevertheless, the third escapade lacked Dom and Brian but held up strictly because it was fresher than the second one. Life is back in the right land and hings careening into the home stretch with ""Fast & Furious."" Brawny Vin Diesel is back full-time in this one after a cameo in the previous outing. Paul Walker reprises his role as FBI Agent Brian O'Connor who is as smooth with his lies as he is with his cars. Indeed, two other originals encore, principally Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. The chief problems with ""Fast & Furious"" are its formula sequelitis and its unbelievable storytelling. Like most standard sequels, one of the originals has to bite the dust to keep things exciting and this time around it is bad girl Michelle, but she goes out for a good cause. You don't expect a ""Fast and Furious"" movie to be credible, but the use of the caves as a smuggler's highway through mountains stretches things to blow-out point. The way that the drivers haul booty through these claustrophobic spaces may be hair-raising as hell but it is also terribly unrealistic. Like the previous entry, director Justin Lin and scenarist Chris Morgan strut their best stuff during the first 30 minutes while the last quarter hour suffers. The ending will leave you looking fora fifth sequel. This is the first time that Dom and Brian, who were pitted against each other in ""The Fast and the Furious,"" square off again and Morgan answers the question as to why the FBI guy let the gearhead go.""Fast & Furious"" opens with an action set-piece that director Justin Lin and scenarist Chris Morgan cannot top. Protagonists Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel of ""The Pacificer"") and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez of ""Girlfight"")are stealing gasoline tanker cars from a lone trucker in the Dominician Republic. Thief is no picnic for the principals. Dom runs interference while Letty, equipped with a canister of dry ice, freezes the coupling devices holding the tanker cars together so that their accomplices can whirl around bootlegger style and hook on and haul ass away. Things go south when the trucker spots Letty atop a tanker car. He swerves and things get hairy. Eventually, after four tanker cars are heisted, Dom wants Letty off the train. About the same time the driver bails. Letty leaps back onto Dom's car, while the truck flips and a tanker car tumbles sideways down a narrow road at our principals. Dom displays his icy cool demeanor and gets them out of there. The law is down on them in no time and they have to clear out. Letty heads back to America while Dom holes up in Panama City, Panama. One day, Mia (Jordana Brewster) gives her big brother a call and informs him that Letty has been murdered. Dom heads back to the states in search of Letty's killer while Brian recruits him to help the FBI nail a notorious drug smuggler.Brian O'Connor's first scene takes place in downtown L.A. as he chases a suspect across rooftops to get the name of a hood who works for the ruthless drug smuggler Arturo Braga. O'Connor's boss is afraid that he has put himself out on a limb by reinstating O'Connor. Now, the Feds have 72 hours to bust Braga before they are jettisoned from the investigation. Naturally, the FBI establishes surveillance squads around the cemetery where Letty is being buried. Predictably, Dom shows up but keeps well hidden as the funeral is held. He hooks up with his sister and investigates the crash site, discovers traces of nitrometh and sets out to find the same suspect, David Park, that Brian is tracking down. Eventually, our heroes paths cross and they go after Braga with different motives. Before long, Dom and Brian--working undercover again--become drivers for Braga.The action never lets up but it gets progressively more far-fetched until it screeches to a halt in a series of caves threading a mountain on the Mexican/American border.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","Bob-45","23 September 2010","Contrary to conventional wisdom, many sequels are superior to their originals (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and WRATH OF KHAN come immediately to mind). However, I cannot recall when the FOURTH film in a franchise was superior to all the others, including the original. However, what else can one say about a movie that: o covers its production costs in its first WEEK o has action sequences rivaling anything in the BORNE, BOND, STAR WARS or INDIANA JONES franchises o Reunites its original cast and improves upon their relationshipsFAST & FURIOUS does all this. Plus it has has fast cars, hot women, great music, outstanding photography, Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez. It even moves better than AVATAR. WOW!I give FAST & FURIOUS an 8","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","Angelus2","2 July 2009","Dominic Torreto is in exile but returns after hearing that his girlfriend, Letty has been murdered. Torreto investigates the murder which leads him to a drug cartel and a man named 'Bragga'.It just so happens that Agent Brian O'Connor is on the case and the two collide....Trying to bring Bragga to justice without killing each other.This isn't an Oscar contender so the acting can be ignored, as the cars, girls and cars...make up for practically all its faults. This film is more emotional than its predecessors as it tries to show a softer side of Dominic and reveal how life is for Dominic's sister Mia.The race scene at the end is definitely worth the wait but I especially enjoyed the 'Qualifying race'...Only the Fast and Furious crew can create great race scenes like this...

So many awesome intense scenes and omg moments. Was pretty deep like the original movie with some good emotional moments and character relationships. Even small things reminded me that we're back in the world created by the original, like dinner with family with a nice song playing, or mia yelling ""dom stop!"" lolit has lots of flaws but this movie is a great time. It brought the series back to where it needed to be. It captured the feel of the first movie.

"Fast & Furious","joshrortiz","27 May 2013","I loved ""The Fast and The Furious."" Cars, ladies, cheesy lines and acting, crazy action = a groovy mix! Fast forward a few years and we finally have ""Fast & Furious""- the first true sequel! So much nostalgia! Seeing Vin, Paul, Michelle, and Jordana together again was fantastic! You can tell that these characters have grown since the first film. Brian is working on a case with the FBI that brings him in collision with Dom, who is back in the states seeking revenge for the murder of his gal Letty. This entry is definitely a bit heavy compared to the first few but that doesn't mean there isn't fun to be had! The opening sequence and the race at the middle of the film are two highlights! The tunnel sequences were not as good though, CGI being one of the reasons- still enjoyed it though! The F&F franchise isn't really known for stellar acting or writing or even realistic action sequences so it's no surprise that this sequel plays the same way. I think that's part of the charm of these movies, at least for me. Don Omar and Tego were hilarious, John Ortiz was good as the villain though not at all threatening, Fenix was just asking to get owned by that car in the end (what a way to go), and seeing Han from Tokyo Drift was a nice little treat. I had hoped we would see more of Gisele and we do in the sequels! That's a good thing!""Fast & Furious"" is a fun, dramatic, action-packed continuation of the franchise with some nice nods to the original that fans will appreciate. The ending got me so pumped for the next one!","7/10"

"Fast & Furious","ma-cortes","22 May 2010","The drivers, the cars and the Drift races are the real stars of this movie , well directed on Mexico location , in Los Angeles , Long Beach , Pasadena, and Backlot Universal Studios. This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets and tunnels. Heading back to the streets where it all began, two men rejoin two women to blast muscle, tuner and exotic cars across Los Angeles and floor through the Mexican desert. When a murder brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dominic Toretto ( Vin Diesel ) reignites his confrontation with agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) . But as they are forced to fight a shared enemy named Campos ( John Ortiz ) and Fenix ( Laz Alonso ) , Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to vanquish him. They are helped by the Toretto's sister ( Jordana Brewster ), former Brian's girlfriend . And from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across US-Mexican border , two contenders will find the best way to get vendetta : push the limits of what's possible behind the car .The picture blends action-packed, suspense , chills , tension , exciting car pursuits, thriller , a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV . Flashy, noisy race-cars set in Panama , California and Mexico by the producers , - the famous Neal Moritz - of the previous parts. Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency . All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage. Justin Lin's direction ( he previously made ¨ Annapolis ¨ and ¨Better Luck tomorrow¨ ) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas . Justin Lin directed the third part titled ¨Tokio drift¨ with Lucas Black and Sonny Chiba , the first and second entry were directed by Rob Coen with similar protagonists to this fourth outing. All of them were lavishly produced by Neal Moritz and also by Vin Diesel. The movie gives new meaning to the term ¨Tuning¨ and ¨Drifting¨. The flick will appeal to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely , it's a must see for cars fonds.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","phatrick88","3 April 2009","I just got back from the midnight screening of 'Fast & Furious' and I have to admit the movie very much exceeded my fairly low expectations for the film. While the original film was entertaining, it was never a good movie by any means. Let's not even get started on the two that followed. The fourth installment however, is another story. Most of the original cast has come back and seeing them back in action together really makes you realize the F&F franchise isn't the same without them. The chemistry between the three leads (Diesel, Walker and Brewster) is the strongest it's been yet, and I would dare to call several of the scenes 'moving' as a result. Who would have ever expected that from Fast & Furious.The movie does an excellent job of keeping you on the edge of your seat, there's no shortage of action and a story that keeps your attention. The movie starts out in the DR with Vin Diesel pulling off a fairly implausible heist of hijacking a fuel tanker with his new crew. Minutes later, we learn of Letty's murder which in turn basically sets the tone for the rest of the movie as Diesel sets off on an all out rampage to even the score. Like the previous three, you certainly need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of the movie, however I was glad to see they didn't go overboard and kept the special effects and CIG to what seemed like a happy minimum.Anyone who's ever been a fan of the Fast and the Furious series will absolutely need to go see this on the big screen. Even if you weren't so hot for the originals, the movie is still worth a look. In my opinion it's acting, story, plot, special effects are the best of the series so far and almost makes it stand out as a respectable movie. Better yet, they've left the door wide open for 'Fast & Furious 5'. To be continued...","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","AdrianOlonan","17 July 2015","I love this series, even though it's weird that lead characters sometimes leave the succeeding films. Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez are absent in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". Even Paul Walker is absent in ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (third film). This film comes out, and it's great to know that they bring back the original characters we love in ""The Fast and the Furious"" (first film). Brian, Dom, Letty, and Mia reunite, thus reliving the relationships they established back in the first film. Despite the conflicts, Brian and Dom team up to bring down a crime boss who import heroin from Mexico to the US.Car chases, lovable cheesy moments (but not Twilightized), and amazing fight scenes! The truck scene, desert chase, and underground tunnel chase are very intense and awesome! All praise and respect to the stunt people who plan and execute these eye candies. The title's weird, I think, because they don't use ""4"" into it. Kinda reminds me of ""The Final Destination"", the fourth movie in the ""Final Destination"" film franchise, and due to box office success, ""Final Destination 5"" came along. I like more the ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" title. Even though the title sounds funny, the number is in there. But watching the trailer, it lives up to the movie's promise, fast and furious. I can't stop indulging in this franchise!","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","nEoFILM","19 April 2011","The best way to describe Fast & Furious would be as a guilty pleasure. There's nothing to lend weight to this film as a great work, an Oscar contender or a movie worthy of critical acclaim, but there something about this, as there was with the first, The Fast And The Furious, back in 2001.Rob Cohen has never been known for subtlety and his 2001 film was far from it, but even even though he had nothing to do with this, his stamp is well and truly on it. Fast & Furious is the fourth in this surprising successful franchise, and besides the fact that I liked the original in spite of the fact that I'm NOT a motor-head, I've avoided the intervening sequels, 2 fast, 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, for one simple reason, besides the fact that just didn't fancy them.No Vin Diesel. I'm not suggesting that Vin is the greatest actor in the Hollywood, nor should be treading the boards of the Royal Shakespeare Company anytime soon, but his blockhead with a heart of gold persona works for me. He's likable and suits this role down to a tee, as does his dimwitted surfer dude sidekick, Paul Walker.Walker offers nothing significant to the film except for his relationship with Diesel. The pairing is enjoyable but little more, but isn't that the point of adrenalin films like this? This is about cars, women, cops and robbers, and great fun to boot. The tone of this movie is on par with Cohen's original and though I can't justifiably compare this to the sequels which I have never seen, I don't want too either. This is the sequel that 2 Fast should have been and I only hope that now they're back on track, that Fast & Furious 5 could be another romp worthy of a watch.It's nice to see a franchise go off track and find its feet again after so many years and it is a testament to the original cast who, though only have a limited range, have clearly breathed life back into the franchise.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","jon.h.ochiai","12 April 2009","Director Justin Lin has a distinctive thrilling visual style. The opening sequence of his ""Fast & Furious"" is an amazing adrenaline rush. Dom (Vin Diesel) and his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) highjack a cargo truck careening down a ravine in the Dominican Republic. Dom, unflinchingly guts out a crazy maneuver that saves himself and Letty from fiery death. This establishes the tone for ""Fast & Furious"": extreme and full throttle. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reunite in this satisfying re-energizing of the franchise. Justin Lin generates spectacular eye candy: strong heroes, slick cars, gorgeous women, intense action, and some to the wildest high speed sequences. The soundtrack is pretty hot, too.What is interesting: this time around Chris Morgan's story is about vengeance. What works is the dynamic chemistry of Diesel and Walker. Diesel is not breaking new territory. He plays to his strength as the powerful dark hero, who follows a code of honor. Paul Walker is a pleasant surprise. He infuses a force and charisma in Brian O'Connor. Walker has become a stronger actor since ""The Fast and the Furious"". This time around he and Diesel are true screen partners. Theirs is a partnership of friction, brotherhood, and ultimately of respect which grounds ""Fast and Furious"". In one scene former girlfriend and Dom's younger sister Mia (beautiful and strong Jordana Brewster) asks why Brian (Walker) let Dom (Diesel) go 8 years ago. Brian tells Mia it's because Dom taught him: ""Nothing matters unless you have a code."" Brian also confesses that he is still trying to find his own code.After Dom's stunt in the Dominican Republic, the authorities are closing in on him. To protect the love of his life, Letty (Rodriguez), he leaves her the money and disappears. However, while in exile Mia breaks the news to Dom that Letty has been murdered back home in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, FBI Agent O'Connor is hunting down the mysterious drug cartel kingpin Baraga, who is able to move large shipments of narcotics across the border with his elite drivers. Brian is also tracking down Dom, who he knows will come back to Los Angeles because of the personal tragedy.Dom returns home just flying under the FBI radar. He has Mia show him where Letty was killed in a car crash. Dom discerns that Letty was brutally murdered, and that the murderer left a distinguishing signature. Mia pleads with Dom to let this go: this will not bring Letty back. Dom sullenly declared, ""It's already too late."" He intends to kill Letty's murderer and find the man ultimately responsible. All paths lead to the mysterious Baraga. So Dom and Brian's destinies collide as they compete as drivers for Baraga's right hand Campos (slick John Ortiz). That race too, is another spectacular mind blowing ride through the trafficked streets of Los Angeles.Okay much of ""Fast and Furious"" is predictable and formulae; however, Justin Lin does so with amazing style and verve. He keeps the action crisp and vibrant. Diesel and Walker are solid heroes to cheer for. Bad guys Campos (Ortiz) and Fenix (ruthless Laz Alonzo) are completely despicable. Jordana Brewster is the right blend of tough and smart as Mia. Surprisingly good is beautiful and enigmatic Gal Gadot as Gisele, who has a soft spot for Dom. ""Fast and Furious"" is a high speed vengeance tale with charismatic heroes Diesel and Walker. Director Lin keeps our attention with hot cars, hot women, and spectacular stunts. ""Fast and Furious"" is not going win any awards, but it is thoroughly entertaining.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","dbborroughs","19 April 2009","Least of the series has the original stars returning to the series to solve the murder of a mutual friend. Paul Walker turning a blind eye to the wanted Vin Diesel hopes to not only track down said killer but also get in good graces with his boss who seem to think he may have made a mistake taking him back.(I won't say more since to do so would reveal too many spoilers and several people I know were upset that reviews gave away too much-which I don't think is really possible) This is my least favorite of all of the films. Sure the races/chases/action are pretty good in an unreal Hollywood sort of way, but the rest of it just sort of lays there. Its purely by the numbers and fill in the blanks and I'm guessing that anyone who sees this will be way ahead of our stars. Me,I was bored and wondering why I bothered. Its not bad, its just dull. I felt no excitement and wondered why I bothered to run out on a Saturday night to see it. I should have waited for cable.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","Tyson14","7 April 2015","Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the Fast franchise. I could enjoy The Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.I find the characters to be much better this time around. Vin Diesel's character, Dom toretto, is back with a vengeance. Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones. At the start of the film he leaves his gang because the police are gunning for him. He then gets a call from his sister saying Letty (Michelle Rodriguez's character) has been killed. Now Toretto is on a revenge mission to kill the person who killed Letty.(in fast and furious 6 we find out she isn't though.) This makes it more of a personal story for the characters, especially Toretto, which I like. I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.I like Paul Walker's character, Brian o Connor, more here than any of the previous films. He seems more mature and professional here. In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent. I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie. Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest. I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do. The other characters are not much. Han Lu form Tokyo Drift returns here, as well as Letty. However, they only show-up in the beginning and then disappear from the movie. This story is really about Brian and Toretto.The villain is also very lazy. The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak. The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favourite villains of these movies.The races are still fun to watch. The races here are probably some of my favourite of the franchise. Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out. There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable. The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favourite Fast film so far. I definitely like it more than the films before it. I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc. The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI. For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","Gordon-11","22 March 2017","This film tells the story of an FBI agent, who teams up with a notorious criminal, and infiltrate the criminal underworld of underground racing. Their goal is to catch a drug lord and bring him to justice, using whatever means required.I still remember watching the first ""The Fast and the Furious"", and I was super impressed by the cars and the energy of the film, even though I do not have a passion for cars. Watching the fourth installment is almost like a step back in time because it was still all about the fast cars and the furious drivers. ""Fast & Furious"" keeps the energy going by a lot of very dangerous car chases. The plot though, is not so clear to me perhaps because I do not quite remember the first three films. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed watching this film.","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","amboo61","4 April 2009","I have read all previous comments and only see a couple of people that actually make a comment that it is supposed to happen between 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift... I'm sure this had something to do with Justin Lin directing Tokyo Drift as well as Fast & Furious. I'm glad that he made it happen that way because I am sure there were many people that saw Tokyo Drift and thought, ""Where did this movie come from?"" It was so random to have it be a Fast and Furious movie when it had nothing to do with either of the original 2 with the exception of the again, random, cameo of Dom at the end of it. In the first couple of scenes of Fast & Furious you see that Han is part of Dom's crew that hi-jacks gas tankers in the Dominican Republic. When the heat is on Dom once again, he tells Han it's time to go do his own thing. Han tells him that he hears of some things going on in Tokyo. If you recall in Tokyo drift, Han tells Sean that Tokyo is his ""Mexico"" he was running to stay out of jail.I really enjoyed this movie. The plot wasn't as detailed as the previous but it followed along well with what you think might happen in a Fast & Furious movie... Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner again, he is still working law enforcement, although this time he is big boy FBI. Vin Deisel is back as Dominic Toretto. He and Brian are trying to get in with a drug ring for different reasons, but team up to help each other get what they are after.The movie is full of everything you expect from the franchise: Nice cars, great racing, hot women and hot guys (to suit everyone's taste) This movie has great action sequences as well. I recommend this movie to anyone that has followed the other 3... or at least the first 2. If they make a 5th one I'll be first in line to see it too.","7/10"

As we left, I did wonder if the image would look better on disc.2021:Recently reading about a friend seeing F9 at the cinema,it gave me the final kick to pick up the Blu-Ray, and return to the 4th round of the Fast saga.View on the film:Becoming the in-house director after this who nailed the style of the series with Fast 5,6 and 9, Justin Lin & cinematographer Amir Mokri signal the change in direction for the franchise with a thrilling opening failed heist set-piece.Moving at high speed, Lin places a emphasis in focusing on practical kitsch-Action dive stunts across vehicles performed by Dom's gang, rather then the speed of the sports cars.Breaking the disagreements between Dom and Brian, Lin drives in on up-close Action, with a hard-hitting punch-up between Brian and Dom, which spins into an exciting final set in tunnels, with Lin using the confined location in tight wide-shots to heighten the time crunch atmosphere of the final chase.Making her film debut, Gal Gadot gives a very good, feisty turn as Gisele, whilst Paul Walker brings a urgency to cop Brian's conflict over which to take, and Vin walks round completely unaware of what type of flick he's in, with his deadly serious performance (never change Vin.)Joined by future Suicide Squad (2016-also reviewed) director David Ayer doing uncredited re-writes, the screenplay by Fast regular Chris Morgan and Ayer changes gears at a crossroads, via the set-pieces in Dom's drive for revenge, (a regular major theme across future entries) being over the top, but treated with a serious tone, rather then kitsch, and surprisingly few mentions of ""Family"" in the dialogue, which instead drives a building of trust between Brian and Dom as drive away fast & furious.","6/10"

It obviously feels more like an F&F movie with these two in the driver's seats, and director Justin Lin knows exactly what is expected of him as he fills the screen with muscle cars engaged in hair-raising races, macho posturing and hot chicks in hot pants (one of whom is future Wonder Woman Gal Gadot). There's nothing groundbreaking about Fast & Furious, but it delivers everything that is required of it.","7/10"

The acting was pretty good, and like usual, Vin Deisel is badass. The plot is kind of realistic, which is a plus. If someone else had of directed the movie, then it would definitely be much better.

"Fast & Furious","dkemathas","15 February 2013","This might bring the audience a lot of questions about the return of the characters Brian O'Connor and specially Han Seoul-Oh after the events in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Fast & Furious is the sequel to the previous films 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), followed by The Fast And The Furious (2001) and the prequel to The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).What that made this Fast & Furious to be a better sequel than the 2003 film 2 Fast 2 Furious is that all the original casts return in this one. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Leticia ''Letty'' Ortiz. The film also introduces new characters Fenix (Laz Alonso), Omar (Don Omar), Leo Tego (Tego Calderon), Cara Mirtha (Mirtha Michelle) and Campos (John Ortiz). Sung Kang who played Han Seoul-Oh in Tokyo Drift has also made a special appearance. We can briefly say that this is the direct sequel to the 2001 film. It begins from where it ended.The film focuses mostly on swag, sex appeal, action, hunt and most importantly on the American Muscle cars. Why the film holds my attention is because the film promises on what is says in it's title: Fast & Furious. It's definitely more fast and more furious than the original one. It has passed 8 years since the last time Vin Diesel portrayed the character Dominic Toretto. He has pumped up his body and fits perfectly to be the legend of street racing. Paul Walker who portrayed Brian O'Connor is still phenomenal as he has always been in the previous Fast & Furious films. Laz Alonso and John Ortiz have lived up in their roles.Overall this is a perfect Saturday-night movie. If you want to see the classics in action then Fast & Furious is definitely the one you do not want to miss!","1/10"
"Fast & Furious","qormi","17 January 2011","Ridiculous opening sequence where they unhook the tankers on a 4-tanker gas transport rig in the Dominican Republic. Letty is running along the top of the tankers without falling off. Cars and pickup trucks going 70 mph in reverse and hooking up the tankers. Nicely shot, but completely ludicrous.The rest of the film was dumb, too. If Dom loved Letty, he wouldn't have left her in he middle of the night and not contacted her in 5 years. Brian is as awkward as a 15 year old throughout. The premise of driving through abandoned Mexican mine shafts at 80 mph was bizarrely dumb. At one point, Dom opened the door to his Charger and jumped into another car, commandeering it. All the while driving 80 mph in a mine shaft! I am not kidding!!! The ending was equally idiotic. Suffice it to say that prison buses have armed guards and police radios.","9/10"

The old characters are back, better story, better cars, better action.....awesome. The beginning had me clutching my chair and moving my head and body like I was actually there.

"Fast & Furious","ThomasDrufke","11 April 2017","With a few meandering and unproductive features, 'Fast & Furious' takes the series to new grounds. Bringing back familiar faces but finally implementing some much needed emotional depth, the fourth installment was the best of the franchise to that date.Back after a short hiatus are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker playing Dom Toretto and Brian O'Connor respectively. Not that the previous two films were entirely pointless, but Dom and Brian are the heart of the films. Without them, you don't get the same feeling of family and meaningful relationships. 'Fast & Furious' may not feature the high-octane stunts and action that its successors do, but it brought the series back to being about family, and particularly the drama that sometimes goes on between family. O'Connor is miraculously back to being an FBI agent after betraying their trust multiple times in the past, but with this series that type of stuff doesn't matter. Toretto is on the run once again since he went missing following the events of the first film. As ridiculous as it is to see Brian once again after Dom, I feel like it was the one last obstacle these two needed before they gained back each other's trust. Once they do, the film takes off. I love all the tension between Brian, Dom, and Mia, especially knowing where all of them end up. But I also love watching the cast drive insanely fast cars at ridiculous speeds and wreck every bit of them. The fourth film still tries to tell a lame undercover racing/drug/crime story with its villain, but the rest of it is a hell of a ride.The supporting cast includes the likes of Michelle Rodriguez, Gal Gadot, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, and John Ortiz. The latter plays the villainous Campos and probably has the most depth and/or personality out of any previous F&F antagonist. Rodriguez is back as Letty, who's death (being a central plot line to the film) is probably the most complicated and convoluted death I've ever seen from any franchise, and I'm still not sure I know exactly what happened.Overall, Fast & Furious progressed the series back to its Toretto vs O'Connor roots, but managed to finally give us the balance of emotion and action that we've wanted. It also happens to be the film that set up what is now more of a heist franchise than it is full of big muscles and muscle cars.+Dom & Brian+Finally balances emotion and action+Supporting cast is written and acted very well-Letty's death & Brian's time with the FBI is still puzzling8.2/10","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","tonyzeno75","4 April 2009","I just saw this and to be honest I was hesitant in buying the $8 matinée ticket but wanted to see a movie and figured what the heck. First of all the 1st film was good, IMO the sequel and then Tokyo Drift were pretty bad but the 4th installment gave a ray of hope when I first saw the trailer. I liked the fact that it had a large part of the original cast.I enjoyed this film and was surprised. They actually wrote a good story and it flowed very well, the action and driving scene's were shot and edited superbly, you did get the feeling that you were in the car at times which adds to the intensity of the driving scenes. I also like the fact that they incorporated American muscle cars instead of just imports this way the movie will appeal to people of all tastes. Overall I was pleasantly surprised of how good the film was. Also the final scene of Phoenix's demise was different than the norm. Bottom line Go see it.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","blake-brown20","3 April 2009","This was a good movie. They were able to bring back all the things that made the first one great like Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Paul Walker, and let go of the things that did not work so well. All the things that you loved in the first one are here and a little more. Vin Diesel does a great job from start to finish. In parts of the movie it almost makes you want to leave your seat and cheer. For all you Paul Walker haters out there he did a good job as well. He is like a backup quarterback in the NFL you want him to manage the game don't try to do to much just do what is takes to win. Walker is not the star of the movie, but behind the star he manages his part well. He does a good job of playing his part and not going beyond that and try to make a great performance. Walker acts within his ability. I for one am not a Walker hater so I never felt like he did a bad job, but I know there are a lot of you out there and you will be happy with his performance in this movie. Just the right blind of action and cars. For all the people that loved Han from Tokyo Drift don't get really excited, his role is only for about 3 minutes at the beginning of the movie. This is not a movie that is going to win any Academy Awards, but it is a movie that will keep you entertain for an hour and forty five minutes. Worth the movie to pay to see this one in the theater. Which is saying a lot for the way the economy is right now. It is the best one in the series.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","Vartiainen","11 May 2020","Paul Walker and Vin Diesel reunite in this continuation of the Fast & Furious franchise. Dominic and his crew are on the run from the law, while O'Conner has returned back to FBI. But then Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is killed and nothing will ever be the same as both Dominic and Brian seek solace for past sins.The film works mostly for the same reasons the previous films did. It's oozing with style, has very charismatic actors playing characters they were born to play, has very fast and cool cars, features a killer sound track, and is just all around fun to watch.I'd still say the original 2001 film is better, although not by much. It simply had rawer edge to it and had novelty on its side.Still, I very much enjoyed this film. Gal Gadot was a blast as a henchwoman to a drug boss, the car scenes were a ton of fun and the plot was kept well together. Plus, this film was the first step towards a grander scope when it comes to these movies. And that's never a bad thing.Not the best F&F film ever made, but a really solid entry, nevertheless.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","WalkThatTalk","5 April 2009","This movie picks up from where the first movie left off. Dominic(Vin Diesel) and Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) are hiding pulling jobs just for the fun of it but Dom knows that none's safe around him and decides to leave Letty. In the city FBI is trying to get their hands on the Drug-lord (Campos) and Brian (Paul Walker) is on the hunt. Letty makes a deal with Brian to cleanse Dom of all charges and in turn go in undercover as an informant. A job goes bad and she gets killed by the bad guy (Fenix) who works for Campos. Dom goes hungry for revenge and is back on the streets looking for the killer. Brian and Dom team up in catching these bad guys and of course Dom kills Felix. In between all this plot is extreme street racing with big engines and loads of action. The movie is well directed and fully satiates your hunger for action adventure and speeding cars. I just loved the first movie so i always wanted the same cast appearing again and thankfully this one didn't disappoint.Vin Diesel is as good as ever.. his screen presence is phenomenal and rest of the cast is great too. I quite liked the opening car race sequence and the rest of the movie was good enough to keep me glued to the chair. Well in the end Dom gets a trial and Brian as an FBI officer testifies and pleads for dropping of all charges but court finds him guilty and sentences 25 years. Brian and Dom's sister get furious with all this and try to get Dom out and thats where it ends. Another open ending for a possible sequel which makes everyone happy i guess.","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","ankishraj","16 February 2014","Fast and furious has a good story. There are also great twists and a superb suspense. There is no dearth of adrenaline pumping and heart-stopping scenes. The film begins at such a high octane level that it gets you hooked on almost instantly. The director of the film and director of action do a stunning job of co-ordinating the action sequences brilliantly. The stunning cinematography also adds to the effect. Vin Diesel is the man that makes this series what it is. He is absolutely outstanding. His perfect partner in crime, Paul Walker, is no less. He is cool and effortless.The rest of the cast does good as well. All in all, a must watch.","1/10"
"Fast & Furious","TheEmulator23","26 July 2009","I only watched this because I watch everything no matter how bad it is. There is absolutely zero story & no purpose for this film being made at all. More than anything that proves how lazy both studios and people are becoming is the fact of the title. The 1st film which was laughable itself but a masterpiece compared to this was named ""The Fast & the Furious,"" the only difference w/this was they dropped the two ""The's."" That is not only pathetic, it's an absolute embarrassment in it's own right. If want to see the same garbage you've already seen well then you'll love this, if want to see some semblance of a plot & mean ANY kind of original plot, then for the love of god skip this. This is trash & everyone involved should be embarrassed for having any part of this.

"Fast & Furious","codehorizon","6 April 2009","Okay, I love this series. It has good looking, along with fast cars, decent performances, and interesting back stories. Fast and Furious is sort of a mix between the last three entries, and that is where this one will either make or lose an audience.The past three were about showing off both tuner and muscle cars while putting them in some very cool situations. The first two were about plain drag and street racing, while Tokyo Drift was about drifting with a couple of street races thrown in for good measure. This one again mixes all three together. In one showcase scene, four racers are scrambling to make it to be the first across the finish line about five miles down the road. They are racing past, into, and around oncoming traffic using street racing and drifting tactics. However, my only gripe about the cars is that they don't seem to be top focus here. Don't get me wrong, Dom's Charger and Bryan trademark car from 2F2F, the Skyline, is back, along with some other cool automotive toys, but aren't used to the effect of the first three.Where this movie shines is in it's presentation. This Fast and Furious is focused on and has, wait for it, a good story fueling (excuse the bad pun) this entry. While nowhere near Oscar or the Academy Awards material, this is fan service to every extent of the meaning. Jordana Brewster, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Vin Diesel, and even Sung Kang (as Han), return for this movie, along with giving decent performances While definitely continuing the story of the first, I didn't hear any references to the events of 2F2F. I'm wondering if they know themselves that that one was a mistake? BTW, this story takes place between 2F2F and Tokyo Drift, if Han returning wasn't any indication.Overall, fans of the series should like this one, and ranks right up there with the first and Tokyo Drift. If you are not a fan, don't go in thinking this movie is going to be revolutionary or extraordinary, like critics. Instead, just think about having fun watching an action packed thrill-ride that is about two hours long.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews","20 July 2009","This is a movie for the guys. Hot chicks, fast cars, big explosions, big stunts and big tuff men. But it's no movie for serious movie goers. No story, worthless sequel and just an excuse for a quick buck. Even though it had the same things the original had it didn't have the same effect. It was pretty much empty.Even though the movie was bad it still had some awesome stunts. One of the only reasons this was watchable was the stunts. Everyone loves to see loud cars roaring through the air while a massive explosion burns behind them.Back to where it started. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez back together again. Another reason this was watchable. But they had to go ruin it by making a bad decision with one of the characters.I recommend it if you like the series. It's really a hit or miss with this movie. A fan may find it better or worse then the previous movies. It should be decided on your own. I give Fast & Furious...4/10","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","blindredemption","5 April 2009","Fast and Furious is certainly everything it promises, but that isn't a whole lot. We get all kinds of suped up cars that will give any sixteen year old the hots and the babes to make the illegal car racing all the more glamorous.Now when I say it's all babes and cars I mean it, there isn't any new character development in any of the characters and the action, while good, is extremely basic, but at least it isn't terrible.Entertaining for a viewing but it doesn't give us anything new to a franchise that has been extremely one note from the get go. Enjoy it and watch the racers act like rock stars! a very modest 6 out of 10","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","jaredlallatin","11 April 2009","It is good to see this movie doing well at the Box Office because it was a lot of good, clean, exciting fun. It was good to see Paul Walker, Vin Diesel and crew back together on film. This movie works, not because of the fun and exciting action scenes, but because it has a reasonable solid story as a foundation, dialog was natural for the characters and above all the movie dealt with the theme of loyalty between friends. Above all this is why, in my opinion, the movie is doing so well at the Box Office. Hollywood, please don't start to think that all it takes is bringing stars back on the set from older successful movies and then you will have a hit on your hands. People, including me, like this film above all because it deals with the loyalty between two friends, ever if they are on opposite sides of the law. Everyone of us that might be a potential audience member understands the importance of loyalty, friendship and the sacrifices you might be willing to make for each other. My advice to everyone is treat yourself and your wife to a nice night at the movies. Go catch this with some good friends or with your brother, brothers, sister, sisters, neighbor, work associate or anyone else you enjoy spending time with. Have fun at the theaters! This is one movie perfect for that good time at the movies!","8/10"

Also better then the last James bond movie and especially better than the stupid transporter 3. Well if you don't like car chases you can still follow the story which is not great but not stupid either. I think they could have done more considering the two main characters are on opposite sides of the law and are very close and have a past.Well I don;t like saying too much about the plot etc...don;t expect the best movie of the year either...","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","DICK STEEL","4 April 2009","The tagline caught my attention, promising a brand new movie with the original cast of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. With the relative box office success of the first film, the sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious saw only Walker returning, with Tyrese trying very hard to step into the big frame of Diesel's without much success. Tokyo Drift picked up the adrenaline from the East's Initial D, injecting the franchise with some Asian flavour, though the only good thing out of that was the introduction of Sung Kang's character Han. So the 4th movie tries to bring together all the best characters to appease fans, and the timeline of this installment sits snugly in between the first and second movies where we learn that Han and Toretto do go all the way back together. Perfect.Vin Diesel had The Fast and the Furious back in 2001 to thank for in making him a household name, where every fan boy out there left the theatres chanting his name and wishing they could emulate his road stunts if given a car as powerful as that in the film. However we know how he turned his back on a franchise, and how his film career had turned out recently, with stinkers such as Babylon A.D. crowding out his filmography. If he's sorely in need of a return to form, then I guess it doesn't take much rocket science to figure out that he would be tempted to return to his Dominic Toretto roots after his cameo in Tokyo Drift.It was smart of Justin Lin to have featured Torretto in his film then just to whet the appetites of fans everywhere, and to helm this installment by trying to top the first film by getting the first cast all back. However, some parts do get rusty after so long, and in wanting to stamp his authority over the original, had made some drastic decisions in order to keep the engine fine tuned and purring. Since it's before the second movie, Toretto is still an outlaw, and Paul Waker's Brian O'Conner is now working for the FBI, before his unexplained turn to crime in 2 Fast 2 Furious, which gets explained here, if you wish of course.The plot doesn't drift away from the standard cop-robber formula, with a cat and mouse game brewing involving a drug run from Mexico and the USA making use of expert drivers to be couriers between the two countries. And when murder is in the name of the game, Toretto gets involved for vengeance, and O'Conner, well, just doing his job. It's just an excuse to see the Diesel-Walker team up, and the franchise's formula dictates plenty of random scantily clad girls gyrating in front of the camera, while hot cars with modified engines gleam seductively under dim garages, and the screeching of tyres when tearing up the roads.If a race movie is not your cup of tea (after so many copycats have come out to milk fans of the genre), then this franchise offers nothing new. Granted that Hollywood doesn't do car chases like it used to, relying a lot now on plenty of computer animation and graphics to spice up the sequences and entertain. Those itching to see a lot of action will have to contend with only 4 major set action pieces, with 2 of which happen in the same tunnel, one bringing back memories from the first film in a heist that doesn't go exactly right, and one being the nod back to Tokyo Drift in having a downtown city area night time race.Fans of the franchise will still find this a worthy addition, but everyone else would wonder why the effort. If this film continues to make money, I won't be surprised if the next film picks up from where Tokyo Drift left off, maybe with the return of Lucas Black's Sean Boswell joining the new crew in a new adventure, with new cars to smash, new babes to romance, and more nitro to burn up the tracks.","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","darkdragon8987","29 July 2009","Fourth in a franchise- wow. What are the chances that sequels ever amount to squat? (maybe 50/50). Although the first movie was all about cars, booze, and women (but a GREAT movie w/ a kick-ass cast); the second movie had basically the same plot, but with new characters- also a good watch though; Tokyo Drift started to show weakness, and what I thought would be the end of the run. Well, here comes Fast and Furious- fourth of the franchise, and I had doubts: The movie starts with the thrilling action right away (as did the first), but takes a turn in a different direction. The main key, was getting all of THE original players back. Then, adding a new twist: BIG emotional issues (like tissue-box). This was not about car racing (muscle cars, big engines)- although enough to enjoy, but instead, this time the movie focuses more on revenge, broken hearts, and dramatic scenes- as opposed to racing for money/titles, fighting, and general b.s.. The turn-around of events in this movie, is what made it THE best of the ""four""- in my opinion. The producers HAD to make SOME kind of changes, or the franchise would surely go out on a very sour note. If you just want fast cars, nitro boosts, and fast women, skip this one. But if you're ready for some original scripting, and having your heartstrings tugged,watch it! I give this movie a 10! Also,it's been 5 years since Dom and Brian hooked up- the maturity really shows on both sides. (And there are some really cool new ""bad"" guys, too!)Will there be a fifth?.....???????","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","Bigbadboy701","6 April 2009","Fast & Furious shows originality far beyond it's title, enough to put it on top of the series with the first. 2F2F was a decent sequel, but definitely was not an ending point. TD was funny, entertaining, and gripping, but once again was not a good ending point for the series. F&F was a GREAT addition to the series. Enough girls, plenty of fast cars, some good one-liners, good action, awesome driving, great stunts, and an awesome cast. This one had more than enough badass-ery to satisfy me. Overall, I went in expecting something like TD, but came out amazed. Any fan of the series will absolutely love F&F!Some gripes: 1) I was disappointed Han didn't have more of a role, I really liked his style in Tokyo Drift. 2) The GPS-Nav thing added nothing to the movie, it was just some stupid Hollywood cheese that had wayyy too much of a part in the movie. 3) During the race-in, Brian was driving parallel to Dom on the dirt road, then at the end of the road he drove down the embankment to catch up with Dom.... WTF?!??!?! That was a PRIME moment to do an epic jump. 4) I thought Lil Wayne had a cameo.....","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","Tweekums","27 January 2017","After a thrilling prologue where Dominic Toretto and his team steal petrol tankers in the Dominican Republic the group breaks up before the cops can catch up with them. Then the story proper begins; one of the team is killed in Los Angeles so Dom risks imprisonment by returning to LA, where he is determined to discover who did it and take his revenge. Using his knowledge of the local street racing scene he traces the killer's car back to drug lord Arturo Braga. Brian O'Conner is also back in LA, working on an FBI in an operation to bring down Braga and his smuggling operation. Inevitably Brian and Dom are soon tearing up the streets as they compete for a position as one of Braga's drivers. Dom wins the position but Brian gets another position after arranging the arrest of another driver. Their first job sees them smuggling heroin through a secret tunnel from Mexico during which Dom learns the killer's identity but their troubles are far from over and neither is the excitement.After a third instalment that saw an entirely new cast racing in Japan it was good to get back to the original cast in the original city. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have a great chemistry in these films even when their characters are going up against each other one knows they will ultimately work together. For the most part there are no real surprises although it came as a genuine shock when we learn the identity of the friend of Dom that was murdered as the actor playing the part was high up the cast list I won't give any further clues to their identity even though it becomes apparent very early in the film. As one would expect there are plenty of scenes involving cars travelling at speed; these are exciting; in particular the chase through the tunnel under the US/Mexican border. Overall I'm sure fans of the previous films will enjoy this as will those looking for mindless action without any really offensive content.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","Lady_Targaryen","23 May 2009","When a crime happens, the fugitive Dominic Toretto and the agent Brian O'Connor need to re team in order to find the same enemy. They will need to work together again, but this will not be easy, since Dominic's trust in Brian is minimum, after all that happened in the past.I was imagining that this movie would be terrible. I liked the first Fast and Furious, but usually when they try to repeat the formula all the time, the result is a boring and too predictable.As an example,I was surprised to see that Letty died. In a too predictable movie, she would be a couple with Vin Diesel again, as Mia and Brian.It was good to see the primary actors from the first Fast and Furious too, since the reason I hated Fast and Furious 2 and 3, was that we don't see Dominic, Letty and Mia, only Brian.In general this movie was okay. Not an incredible thing, but not the worst thing too. I missed a bigger emotion while watching it, but being exactly as the first movie is never an easy task.","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","Phanofmuzik-2","5 April 2009","Ill be the first to tell you: Relative to a by the books ""good"" movie, this movie is horrendous. With that out of the way, Ill explain why its awesome and gets a 9 out of 10.Movies are about having fun, and quite honestly, its not often they pack as much fun in as this one. Lots of cheesy 1 liners, Lots of cheesy explosions, tons of references back to the first Fast and the furious, and lots of pretty sweet cars driving terribly doing absurd things. If you go in expecting anything but an action movie with a couple of semi-forced cheesy side stories, you're in the wrong movie. just sit back, stop thinking, and enjoy the ride.For the record, Im also a huge car guy (I legally race myself, do design and fab work for race cars, and am a mechanical engineer) and admittedly, the original movie is what got me started on cars when I was 14. Even to the car guy this movie is a complete joke, albeit a hilarious one. STi's without drive shafts, AWD cars doing RWD burnouts, and the list goes on with mishaps even with the subject matter. The whole point is that it doesn't matter at all and its just a pointless fun movie.enjoy!","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","Otoboke","24 September 2009","As is usual is with Fast & Furious movies, you know what you're getting into long before you take your seat. While it's hard to imagine anyone wilfully buying a ticket to the latest Fast & Furious romp under any other pretence, another commonality that exists within the franchise is that the movie's sole trademark and selling point too often gets submerged within lacklustre drama, plot lines and acting. Indeed, you wouldn't have a hard time convincing the average member of the public that the series itself was based upon a video game; not only does it pack the same gloss and action as your average polygonal adaptation, but it also shares the same detractive traits. If movies such as Street Fighter, Dead or Alive or countless others have taught us anything, it's that building a movie around high-octane thrills usually doesn't work if you don't have any characters or a tangible plot to latch it all on to. Sure enough, if Fast & Furious could pace itself properly and sustain momentum, this wouldn't be so much of a problem; yet as it stands, this is just another entry into an already tarnished and overdone franchise devoid of the zest it started the race with.Going over the general plot of Fast & Furious is almost futile; if you've seen any of the previous installments, you'll know the general ideas at play here. Criminals, illegal street races, conflicts between the good guys, the bad guys and the even badder guys—all caught in a turmoil of wreckage, spare car parts, nitro, elaborate stunts and even a little personal grievance for Mr. Diesel thrown in there for good measure too. The concoction has its definitive moments which do their job well; the car chases and races are potent and well choreographed, with crisp photography to capture it all in superb detail. Unfortunately however, out of about two hours of screen-time here, the movie is unbearably dull for about ninety of those minutes. The problem of course is that the characters here aren't interesting; their plights are transparently obvious and the conflicts between them are tepid to point where you know who you're supposed to be rooting for, but you probably won't really care. An example of Justin Lin's directing style is apparent early on in two great action sequences—both come before any real plot development takes place and yet the way in which the action is framed allows for it to be exciting; shame the same cannot be said for the drama which pads all this sixth-gear adrenaline rush.As far as no-brainer, stoic action movies go, Fast & Furious is about as typical as it gets. The performances, which are constantly punctuated by a ridiculously manipulative score by Brian Tyler (that doesn't work precisely because it's so over the top), fluctuate between overly-calculated machismo on the part of the male leads, and hormonally charged melodrama from the females (that is, when they're not being parades around in skimpy clothing). The resulting façade that permeates the movie is cold and uninteresting; it certainly doesn't help that the characters as they are written on paper are devoid of any real signs of depth, but with actors that bring close to nothing to any of them, Fast & Furious is more than just braindead; it's downright boring when it's not tearing up the roads.You get the sense that this is exactly what Justin Lin strived to achieve from this venture however and I guess some people will eat up the hard-bodied approach that he takes to delivering both the action and drama. Yet for anyone less interested in action-movie cutouts clinging at each other's throats for two hours (check your wallet, if there isn't a gym card in sight forget it), there won't be as much fun to be had here. When it comes down to it, Fast & Furious has the right parts to make for a thrilling movie on the basis of its action alone, yet burdened with predictable drama and lame characters, twenty minutes of high-speed thrill isn't quite worth the traffic jam of ideas that you have to suffer through to get there.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","drmuhammedsamiduru","21 April 2020","The Fast and the Furious series movies always continue with more excitement and action than the previous movie. The first scene of the film, as usual, appears before the audience with the peak of action and tension. The action of the first scenes allows the audience to lock on the screen throughout the movie. The movie feeds the audience to action. Dom's coming back in series 4 gives the audience what he wants, but what happened to Letty is disappointing to the audience.Adding a mystery about Braga to the movie has also contributed greatly to the audience watching the movie with curious looks.There is nothing to say to the cars, they are all very good, very fast and beautifully modified.But this movie is also overshadowed by erotic scenes like the first movie of the series. Especially the kissing scene of two girls does not like people at all. I wish they shoot the movies without adding the erotic scenes into the script.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","KineticSeoul","30 April 2011","Some say this is a good sequel but I am going to have to disagree, yeah it does have some okay race scenes. But it just wasn't exciting and the plot didn't even make the races all that interesting to watch. It just seemed like the makers wanted to cash in quick by showing elements that most guys would be into. Which is fine, but besides that nothing about this movie gets the attention. Yeah Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are back in this but the way they go about accomplishing races and other task just didn't get my attention and there is little to no tension during the races. I didn't even particularly find a lot of the action in this movie to be all that exciting or entertaining for that matter, although the stunts were pretty good. It seemed like this movie depended on two actors coming together and didn't put much thought into the plot. The plot tries to go serious, well sort of compared to he other movies in this franchise but it just didn't work. The vengeance direction of this movie wasn't effective and didn't lead to caring about any of the race nor was there any tension. Very forgetful plot and nothing really stands out, however the 4 main car sequences was alright with the stunt sequences as well.5/10","7/10"

It is the sequel to The Fast and the Furious (2001) and the fourth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel, Late Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Gal Gadot, Shea Whigam and Laz Alonso.This film is the fourth installment of fast and Furious series and for the best amongst the four, be it action, acting, screenplay, car chases or stunts, i am also surprised to see such a lower rating of the film because for me this is one of the best film of the four.The plot of the film is average and moreover predictable but the execution of the movie is commendable and will keep you engaged through out the film.The screenplay of the film is fast paced and will keep you glued through out. The screenplay writer deserves a special mention here for the superb screenplay.Acting is great and Vin Diesel and Late Paul Walker had again stole the show with their impeccable acting, Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez were average but effective, John Ortiz was not that effective, rest of the cast were decent. The climax of the film is great and gives a decent closure to the film.Overall an entertaining film with some great stunts.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","Movie_Muse_Reviews","28 March 2017","Vin Diesel and Paul Walker made one ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie together, a movie that was debatably decent – at best – back in 2001. Eight years (and two other ""Fast and Furious"" movies) later, Universal Pictures decides a reunion is in order, and whether that decision came out of a genius inkling or total desperation, it worked – to the tune of an April box office record and the restart of a movie franchise that was always meant to be.""Fast & Furious"" doesn't give this series a facelift (a new paint body/paint job? I'm not good with car metaphors), but time has worked in its favor. Director Justin Lin (spin-off ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"") definitely has a more modern sense of style that makes this movie feel made in another era compared to the original ""Fast and the Furious"" and ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" which definitely show their age. Part of this is thanks to improvements in CGI and green screen technology, but Lin also employs a grittier, hand-held approach. From the first few minutes of the film, which shows Dominic Toretto (Diesel), girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and the rest of their gang trying to hijack a tank truck in the Dominican Republic, it's clear that visually speaking, ""Fast & Furious"" has greatly improved over its predecessors. In terms of the story – that's another matter.The same situations and plot schematics from previous films unsurprisingly show up in ""Fast & Furious."" O'Conner is working for the feds again causing his superiors' headaches and he and Toretto are again placed at odds with each other as they're after the same Mexican drug lord, albeit with different tactics in mind. They even must race each other to get in with the bad guy. All this is to be expected, however, given the ""reunion"" aspect of the story. Plenty of dialogue tilts toward a reminiscing vibe in hopes of conjuring up fond memories for people who loved the original. The film thinks and acts as though it's building on that movie's ""legacy,"" but the reality is that it's trying to erase the previous two films a bit and fix its own trajectory. Fortunately, it does, though not nearly as well as it thinks it has.Writer Chris Morgan – also brought over after his work on ""Tokyo Drift"" – demonstrates a sound understanding of what made the first movie good, and that's the Dom-Brian relationship. He constructs a new up-and- down journey for the two of them, much of which hinges on past feelings. Morgan devotes the downtime of the script to this relationship. It goes beneath the surface, which the first films (and especially ""2 Fast 2 Furious"") failed to do. Quick scenes of a brooding Diesel as Dom reflects on the anti-climactic loss of Letty (the news is just dropped in as exposition) don't generate an emotional response, and you can guess exactly what O'Conner will say as he tells Mia (Jordana Brewster) why he let Dom go in the first film, but these moments, cliché as they are, do help endear us to the characters a little more. More important than anything, the superficial MTV Spring Break vibe has dissipated (aside from one party scene early on and a little too much Pitbull music). The film is far more respectful of its female characters, even if there aren't enough of them in important roles. Mia is not an important role – she's the men's emotional sounding board.Of course, the action is still the most important part of these films, and Lin brings the kinetic energy that keeps ""Fast & Furious"" engaging. He does employ some of the same race and chase sequence techniques (the CGI view inside the engine sadly returns) that previous directors employed in their films (showing the speedometer, gear shifts, feet moving on pedals, etc.) but it's a little smoother and delivers more mouth-agape moments. Unfortunately, the climactic tunnel chase is dark, computer-heavy and a little disappointing on the whole.Putting all details aside, ""Fast & Furious"" achieves what was undoubtedly the most critical objective for its producers and Universal: get this once-promising franchise back on track. It does all the dirty work necessary to get its main characters back together and on the same page so that future films can take them in potentially exciting new directions.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Fast & Furious","bkoganbing","9 April 2009","If your taste in film runs to car chases and blood than Fast & Furious will more than live up to its title. The special effects do somewhat make up for a story that had its origins in another film with the same protagonists in 2001. I suppose you will have to have seen that film to understand what's going on here.Vin Diesel as a career criminal and Paul Walker as the LAPD officer working with the FBI to nail Diesel are back again, picking up where they left off. Some really bad blood happened as Walker in the previous film got intimate with Diesel's sister Jordana Brewster. Now however both are after the same man, a criminal kingpin of mysterious origins who has killed Diesel's sister, Michelle Rodriguez.They both go undercover so to speak each not giving the other's game away. These facts are divulged in those precious few moments between car chases, fights, and shootings which come in abundance.Nothing terribly new here, but the ending is absolutely ludicrous, no way Paul Walker trashes his whole career for what he does.","6/10"

"Fast & Furious","kosmasp","11 August 2009","That the actors had fun making the movie (maybe apart from Michelle Rodriguez, more on that, maybe on her Myspace site), is pretty obvious. And the movie feels light and fun too. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reprise their roles from the first Fast & Furious movie. Also two women come back to this film, although it's pretty clear that the boys are the ""driving power"" behind the concept/movie (and yes pun very much intended).The story isn't something special and you should really try to shut your brain and enjoy the ""ride"" (again pun intended), because the stunts are really good again. I think this should be a nice closure to the whole franchise, but let's see what the producers say/think. You can only hope that Mr. Diesel get's back on his feet and reprises his ""Pitch Black"" character (Riddick) or get's another role like in the movie ""Find me guilty"" (this time hopefully people will notice).","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","questl-18592","6 August 2021","So, fourth in the franchise and it really makes you wonder how this ever managed to see a 5th film. Yeah, the first one is fun but then you get 3 whiffs in a row and somehow it still got another shot. In the case of this one, it's not bad per say, it's just remarkably underwhelming, perfectly bland and vanilla. We also get a return of some of the wretched CGI that plagued previous films.The only real memorable part of this movie is that Gal Gadot is in there and to see Wonder Woman popping up in one of these flicks is kinda shocking. Really not a good enough reason to check this out though.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","BA_Harrison","21 July 2018","When street-racer Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is murdered by a member of the Braga drug cartel, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) teams up with FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) to bring those responsible to justice.Fast & Furious, the inventively titled fourth film in the popular Fast and Furious franchise, delivers more pedal to the metal, full-throttle, high-octane thrills and spills. But where the series was originally little more than 'car-porn' geared towards young petrol-heads and custom car fans, this entry takes a slightly different route, the action more accessible to those who, like me, drive a very sensible family hatchback with zero street cred and nothing under the hood, but who still enjoy slick, undemanding popcorn blockbuster fun.With a plot that offers broader appeal, Vin Diesel back in the driving seat, accompanied by Walker, Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster as his sexy younger sister, and an early role for Gal 'Wonder Woman' Gadot, part four is the most enjoyable Fast & Furious so far.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","Magalhaes9","4 April 2009","The fourth film in the series, Fast & Furious is full of action but misses the mark once again. In my opinion, the film is much better than the previous two, as the original cast including Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriquez return. However, something has not returned from the original and that is the CARS. I could count the number of cars that interested me on one hand, and that is not a good thing. And once again, Paul Walker is driving a skyline and Vin Diesel is driving his American muscle. Come on where is the new stuff? Walker is an FBI agent and Diesel is his typical outlaw self. Both work together in bringing down one of the most powerful drug dealers in the country and they do a great job. The movie is full of action, with multiple entertaining action scenes. But what is missing are the most important factors of a Fast and Furious movie: street racing, tuners, and a plot people can actually relate with. The first film was so popular because, although it was a box office movie, it was full of real people and their actual cars. Fast and Furious 4 is too unrealistic with too much CGI...the director should have gone back to the roots of street racing.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","neil-476","7 May 2009","This movie starts off with a great sequence - an outrageous, but hugely enjoyable combination of driving, stunt work and special effects, and then goes - well, I'm not quite sure where.There is a story - it's a bit muddled, and told in a way which is a bit muddled. There appear to be things which people do with no clear explanation of why. And all of it takes place at high speed and excruciatingly loud volume.I confess that I've only seen isolated bits of the earlier movies, and I wouldn't know a trans-am from Pan-Am, so maybe I'm not the target demographic. But I like Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and, while I don't have much time for Michelle Rodriguez, I have LOTS of time for Jordana Brewster (or, at least, I would have given the opportunity), so I quite liked this movie despite the fact it doesn't make as much sense as it ought to (and it didn't ought to make much!).","2/10"
"Fast & Furious","Jay_Exiomo","2 April 2009","Exhausted and pretty much running on synthetic artistry, ""Fast & Furious"" not only drops its definite article from the title but also much of the natural car chase sequences and canny blithe in place of heavily computer-generated action set pieces and a palpably inappropriate seriousness. Returning director Justin Lin (from the third installment ""The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift"") impersonally helms this fourth installment that reunites its original lead cast for more physics-defying engines, brain-dead logic, scantily clad bimbos, and foot worship for good measure.Not that its target audience would primarily look for it but there's a plot and it involves Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) who's out to avenge the murder of a loved one courtesy of a drug kingpin. This leads him to another reluctant team-up with undercover FBI agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and once again they are thrust into hazardous street racing from downtown LA to Mexico, and the run-of-the-mill narrative more or less goes into auto-drive from here.Largely debilitating for this latest hot rod project is its cliché-ridden script that has not a meager of inventiveness or eagerness, a sentiment apparently shared by its actors who are simply going through the motions, specially Diesel who highlights ""Fast & Furious""' misplaced intentness by exhibiting a labored sensitivity despite the caricature machismo. And though everything that has kept the series going is here gratuitously put at disposal, which is to say loads of wheels and hot-looking females, as a whole it starts to feel repetitive - a redundant profit-oriented scheme that cannot be saved by the sporadic appearance of Jordana Brewster.","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","thesar-2","26 May 2009","'Fast And Furious' is to testosterone males as 'Twilight' is to young females. Both were geared only to one target audience forgetting everyone else. At least the recent reboot, 'Star Trek' (2009) remembered other demographics. Evidence: 'Fast And Furious' contains almost zero plot, fast moving cars, explosions, buff males and beautiful females – computerized or not, (and speaking of which) a video game atmosphere, male-to-male fighting, guns, bad guys vs. cops, etc, etc. At first, I wasn't going to downgrade this simple movie due to the director knowing its target audience, but then the main stars meet again, for the first time since part 1. It was at that moment, the movie that didn't seem like it could go any further south, it entered the abyss. Yes, I realize the whole attitude of sitting back and just enjoying the, ah hem, ride, but it's hard to ignore the ridiculous storyline, every known cliché, every scene more predictable than the last (Gee, I wonder who the bad guy is), horrid acting, laughable dialogue and completely unrealistic action sequences/scenes. Walker, for one, gets plummeted in the face a dozen times, yet not a drop of blood or bruising surfaces – what's his next movie? 'The A-Team' remake? And Vin Diesel jumps from one 100 mph car to the next to not only avoid certain death, but continues to fight. Even John McClane would say: ""Yeah, right."" I'm sure there are those who will criticize my critique and, again just say, leave your brain at the door, but like my feeling on 'Twilight,' even stereotypical manly men deserve more than this provides. Basically FBI Walker (i.e. Clarice Starling in 'Hannibal') is reckless & on verge of being fired and is chasing down the same drug lord coincidentally on-the-run Vin Diesel is also out to avenge.","7/10"

Especially if you like hot cars and hot, scantily clad women. I really can't tell you how much the story has in common with that of the previous movies (I honestly don't remember the stories of any of these movies a week after seeing them), but who really watches these for the story. There's something about Dom (Vin Diesel) looking for revenge and Brian (Paul Walker) trying totaled down some drug importer. Obviously, both those things involve lots of cool cars racing around (the parts that I do end up remembering). That's where the movie shines, even though there aren't quite enough of them. The car scenes are genuinely exciting, with director Justin Lin having a great eye for capturing that kind of action. All in all, this is a slick action movie that more than lives up to the Fast & Furious name. If you liked the others, you like this one too.","8/10"

The series was running on fumes by the time they ""got the old gang back together,"" but the production team knew how to craft a loud, sleek machine of populist stupidity, full of fast cars, barely-concealed backsides, substandard CGI, and lots of gravelly proclamations about family, loyalty, and chumps being busters. You get what you expect, but the high-octane chases being reduced to ones-and-zeroes so often is disappointing, as is an instantly forgettable villain who's less threatening than a Geico agent holding insurance claims on all the wrecked candy-colored imports. Not the worst the franchise had to offer, but its technique is more competent than supercharged, and in hindsight, it acted as little more than a transition between the street-racing outlaw dopiness of the previous films and the gargantuan heist/superspy outings to come.43/100","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","Kevinator007","24 May 2009","Paul Walker and Vin Diesel together again - I was thinking this is going to be a walk down memory lane and relive the excitement of the first movie. Now the first movie was all about cars - you were cast into the world of street racers - for those who love cars, it was simply fan-tastic. The franchise of fast & furious was always about cars. The story lines were not very elaborate but the film was not supposed to be thriller or a masterpiece in cinema. But it stood out because it revolved around cars and few films have done that way. F&F4 however is another story. And indeed, story they've tried to inject in the film. That meant less time to talk about cars and anything related to the world of street racing. Yes, you will see a few races (I don't want to reveal too much) but they have tried to make F&F4 accepted by a wider audience. Fair enough! But it also means, it will have to be judged with a bigger variety of films. And I'm afraid to say, that there are better action packed thrillers out there. It is good entertainment to see good old American muscle cars ripping through the Mexican deserts and through tunnels barely large enough for your scooters but it stops there. Those who are fans of the first F&F will have to watch this 4th one but as cliché as it might sound, it does not beat the original.","1/10"

Despite the circumstances, and their prior history, the two reluctantly decide to work together to bring the lowlife down. Silly, clichéd sequel has the expected high-octane action sequences, but suffers from shallow characters, crummy dialogue, weak acting, and a ridiculous story.

"Fast & Furious","Markk-455-632687","27 April 2017","The one-two punch of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return to the streets of Los Angeles in the sequel that essentially turns '2 Fast 2 Furious' and 'Tokyo Drift' into side stories or spin offs. After Vin Diesel left the series, no one expected him to ever return. Then he did... at the end of 'Tokyo Drift'. The movie itself isn't as good as 'Fast Five', 'Fast & Furious 6', 'Furious 7' or 'The Fate of the Furious' but it's the movie that set the plot in motion for the installments to come. Michelle Rodriquez's character begins a tremendous story arc from being presumed dead, to deemed still alive, to losing her memory, etc. Paul Walker's Brian is left to repair the damage with Dom and Mia from 'The Fast and the Furious' from 2001, where they learned he was an LAPD cop working undercover for the FBI. Tensions between Dom and Brian are high when Dom learns Brian was working with Letty to go undercover. Dom later learns Letty was doing it in exchange for Dom's freedom. The movie features in my opinion the greatest street race of any of the 8 movies. The Los Angeles 4 car race to see who will drive for Braga is incredibly well done. It's also the rematch between Dom and Brian from the original's drag race.","6/10"

Sometimes a blast, sometimes weird as heck, but always with lots of groovy colors.I like the first FnF. It introduced fun characters and the cars were cool and all. The sequels had to be pretty lame, because this franchise is nothing without Vin. Walker could be cut in a heart beat, but not our good, role-playing friend Diesel (I believe he played a wizard). Even when the going is redonkulously over the top, he remains cool as hell. I like his overly calm hero type. Let's hope he doesn't do another children's movie after this.There are a couple sweet nods to the first movie, which is always appreciated by us continuation prostitutes. Sequel must be a sequel, damn it! End chase almost ruins the movie, because it is such brain vomit it might actually make you go blind.

"Fast & Furious","Chris Knipp","4 April 2009","This fourth entry in the tough-guy, street-racer, busty-babe franchise is, and is not, worthy of the first. It's brought back the original actors, and they still look good. It's got at least one of the original street races. But now, as the opening sequence shows, it's joined the blockbuster rush and shifted over into a CGI-world of preposterously extravagant video-game car events. This intro is like the overkill prelude of 'Quantum of Solace.' Both movies show a trend toward numbing their audiences out with speed and violence in the opening shots, instead of quietly warming them up. It's not a good strategy. 'Fast & Furious' is replete with action that's neither credible nor as integral to the plot as it ought to be, or as the action was in the first in the series, Rob Cohen's 'The Fast and the Furious' (2001), which itself was a glossier reimagining of the kind of cheapie Fifties and Sixties fast-car movies Tarantino plays with in 'Death Proof.' But this one's still got tough guys and busty babes. It's got colorful muscle cars for hot-rodders to drool over. And it's got bright, clear images that are often beautiful. Though they don't quite offset the choppy editing, they punctuate it in an esthetically pleasing way.In the first film Dom (Vin Diesel) disappeared into Mexico. Diesel missed the second episode, seemingly holding out for better career opportunities that didn't quite materialize. His big star vehicle, the 2002 'xXx,' was a bust, despite the presence of B-picture diva Asia Argento. He did star in Sidney Lumet's quirky trial drama, 'Find Me Guilty', if anybody remembers. Having reappeared in episode three, Tokyo Drift (like this directed by Justin Lin), Dom's now living in the Dominican Republic with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). (Note for devotees: in time this new movie fits between episodes three and four.) It's Dom and Letty in the opening frames, stealing a multiple-unit truckload of oil. But their trickery defies the laws of physics and human dexterity too much to matter, even if it weren't too soon to get our adrenalin to pump that hard. Vin's still as muscled and macho; he was lumpen before; now he's just a little thicker. So is his delivery of dialogue, which now has an extra half-second delay. But there's something that makes it hard not to like Vin.Paul Walker (as Brian O'Connor) is similarly likable, with a prettier face. He doesn't have the bottle-blond golden boy look of the original 'The Fast and the Furious,' but he still has a square-jawed, sterling quality mingled with toughness that suits his role here as, now, a cop who turns rogue (or a rogue turned cop; he's not sure) aiming to serve higher ends--but unwilling to betray his old street-racing, law-breaking buddies. He aims to catch a drug kingpin his police boss seems content to let by, but he's forever loyal to Dom.Walker, like Diesel, has star quality, though he too has not exactly had a blockbuster career. He did, however, star in the mind-bendingly over-the-top action flick 'Running Scared,' and got to play the martyred Marine platoon leader in Eastwood's 'Flags of Our Fathers.' Though the plot of 'Fast & Furious' may not always serve Walker and Diesel as well as it should, there's an authenticity about their line delivery still that puts across the myth of their camaraderie and loyalty to a code that Dom has, and Brian is still working on.At least the movie has the sense to make the opening hijack attempt a failure. It leads Dom to go and hide out in L.A. with his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), who used to be Brian's girlfriend. That flame, predictably, is easily reignited when the plot needs a romantic boost.In the street race sequence, Dom has a GPS screen with a woman's soothing voice (that of Gal Gadot, an exotic new addition to the femmes list) to show the big boy and us where he is in his trajectory. This shows the influence of Paul WS Anderson's 'Death Race,' which took the car race genre up a notch. Alas, though, the slick technology takes us further away from the personal, homemade quality of street racing, which in the first episode was about horsepower and garage work and macho taunts, not visual stunts and hi tech screens. Despite all the crashes (more often head-over-heels than in real life) these movies make racing on the roads look safer than it should, which is why this movie has a detailed ""DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME"" disclaimer at the end. (And there is stunt driving in this movie, even though it's undercut by the CGI tricks.) You'd better believe that warning. Better not to drive at top speed into a half-shut Mexican mountain tunnel. And don't try catching a guy your pal has just dropped out a window, either.It remains to be seen if this movie, which is still fun and fast, helps Diesel and Walker on to the star rules they may deserve, or, what seems equally possible, just sidetracks them further. Lovers of the franchise are not going to be howling with disappointment, but new converts at this stage seem unlikely.","5/10"

"Fast & Furious","Quinoa1984","10 April 2009","The latest installment in the Fast & Furious saga (instead of giving it a tune-up in terms of a different title, after 2 Fast & 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, they just removed the ""The"" words to possibly fool certain viewers), starring again Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, functions fairly competently enough as a car chase and/or car driving picture. That it never involved me in terms of its story or characters could be another matter, but it isn't. It's precisely why this movie, for all of its money and care and sense of ""hey, 13 year old boys will go APE over this"", it's got nothing at all that one would not see in a video game.While I might have thought this could have been a deterrent to its box-office potential it is about to cross the 100 million mark with still more to go. And yet I wonder if I am the only one who, within the first sequence if not a little longer into it, could think ""yeah, didn't I just see this in, oh, any given Grand Theft Auto video game""? And the fact is a Grand Theft Auto game is what this movie is: drug dealers, gangsters, super-slick driving with the occasional guiding voice coupled with dialog that in a video game one would just click ahead to go past. Whatever little plot and character development there was in the first film, which certainly had more fun with itself, is given the pits here.For anyone who's had the pleasure of a GTA experience (the best of them, I mean, not the first one which didn't have nearly the fun of III or Vice City) one can ride cars as fast as possible and even let the Id out as much as wanted - you get star ratings for your wanted level, and mission be damned, just have a good time. The failure of Fast & Furious is that for any moment I could try to get into it as entertainment it pulled back into video game territory, and in a millisecond realize the lack of a controller to take over. It's synthetic entertainment ala Transformers, and while Justin Lin is not the caliber of BOOM-EXPLOSIONS ARE SO COOL! filmmaker like Michael Bay he's lost any sense of real interest in what makes a story work well - sad considering his first film, Better Luck Tomorrow, and the underrated Finishing the Game, did very much just that.If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise- and frankly I never met one and am not sure even the ones in the audience were- you'll dig it a lot. For everyone else, stick to the video-games.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","jboothmillard","18 April 2012","This was the fourth film in the non-stop high octane franchise full of cool and fast cars racing and chasing each other, including lots of action and some stunts along the way, directed by Justin Lin (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast & Furious 4, 5 and 6). Basically five years after leaving Los Angeles, street racer and thief Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew, consisting of his girlfriend Leticia ""Letty"" Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Tego Leo (Tego Calderón), Rico Santos (rapper Don Omar), Cara Mirtha (Mirtha Michelle) and Han Seoul-Oh (Die Hard 4.0's Sung Kang), are hijacking fuel tankers in the Dominican Republic. Toretto is devastated to hear that his beloved Letty has been killed in L.A., so he returns there to find out what happened to her, whilst there he bumps into his former friend, now enemy, reinstated FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), who is assigned to capture the mysterious drug lord Arturo Braga (John Ortiz). Both O'Conner and Toretto, who finds out Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed, have a shared enemy, they hear that Braga is looking for replacement drivers, so they go undercover to join the gang, of course with their feud reignited this will make trusting each other difficult. From convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, all involving fast cars and automobiles, they get close to all of Braga's dodgy dealings, with the help of Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), who Brian had a previous relationship with, this also becomes reignited. O'Conner works to find a way to catch the criminal, who is not easy to identify, while Toretto is on a personal vendetta to get revenge on whoever is the killer, who turns out to be Fenix (Laz Alonso), one of Braga's men. Also starring Gal Gadot as Gisele Yashar, Jack Conley as Penning and Shea Whigham as Michael Stasiak. When released in cinemas the title did confuse some viewers, as did The Final Destination (released the same year), because both sounded like the first film in their series, but I suppose you can ignore this. It is good to see Diesel and Walker back in the series following the previous film with neither of them (apart from Diesel's short cameo), and it is good to see Rodriguez get a bit more to do than previously. From the fourth film onwards the series changed in mood and style, it may feel different but in a way it's more modern, the storyline here however is predictable with the usual characters trying to bring down drug dealers. To be honest, the storyline going on is not the thing to pay the fullest attention to, it is the pedal-to-the- metal stuff, all the colourful and cool cars fuelled up, with extra rocket boosters and switches, that speed and crash their way around, and the explosions and stunts along the way keep the pace up as well, the opening sequence and later tunnel chases in particular are most exciting, but the rest of film suffers from dragging sequences and clichés, all in all it's an average action thriller. Okay!","3/10"
"Fast & Furious","tom1111","3 April 2009","This is a great movie. A lot of action, deep drama, common-sense dialogue. This is pretty much a little grown up movie. This is definitely not a video game kind of movie. Vin Diesel is good in this movie with deep drama and struggle. I liked the dialogue that was real world. I liked the cars.This movie is definitely recommended for all younger people if you like or not like cars. This movie also doesn't have too much racing, which is fine. Watch the movie and your weekend will be much more entertaining. Ending was great too.Director Justin Lin did a fine job of directing the movie, which is crucial to sequel movies that tend to lose the depth and character development. He actually made it more serious movie than I expected and character development is well. I was expecting non-sense 24/7 racing with no dialogue, which it wasn't like that.","7/10"

"Fast & Furious","PWNYCNY","4 April 2009","Okay world, we have a new bad guy, a new nemesis, a new Hollywood heavy, Fenix Rise played by Laz Alonzo. Although billed as a supporting cast member, Mr. Alonzo carries this movie. He saves this otherwise routine action movie from cinematic complacency. The movie has a flimsy story, a ridiculous plot, and good if not exceptional acting from the two leads. Vin Diesel is always wonderful, but he's not the same great character from the original. However, the beautiful Jordana Brewster gives a credible performance but the incredible Michelle Rodriguez is practically no where to be found, which further weakens the movie. Why Ms. Rodriguez is given so little play is puzzling and her absence lowers the temperature of this movie by several degrees. Actresses like Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster are meant to be seen and admired, so, Hollywood, please showcase them because they are wonderful ... and hot.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","killbill_28","16 April 2009","Fast and Furious is the fourth movie in the series, set five year after the original and set before ""Tokyo Drift"". This time the original cast is back behind the wheel. Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Heading back to the streets. After his girlfriend Letty is gunned down after doing a job for drug dealers (which Dom told her not to do after he wanted out), fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto reignites his feud with FBI agent Brian O'Connor. But as they are forced to confront the same enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him.The story of this movie is just plain dumb, its dull and boring! Its not a fast and furious movie at all. Its more of the drama and crime mystery movie. There's only two major racing scenes in the movie in the 107 minute running time. The racing scenes when they do come aren't spectacular they are just dull and boring and we have seen it all before in the previous films. (Muscle car vs Japanese import). Things in this movie are just plain stupid and silly, like the ending where a Subaru Impreza WRX STI can keep up with a 900hp supercharged Dodge Charger! (Whatever). They couldn't even make it look good on film! I know that 2 Fast 2 Furious had silly and unrealistic scenes with an Evo 7 beating a SS Yenko Camaro but they still made it nail biting and look good, that's not the case in this movie. In other words this movie makes 2 Fast 2 Furious look like a masterpiece!Its a shame that I disliked this movie the love the Fast and Furious series a lot but this one just didn't have the passion like the previous films had. See it and make your own mind up about it. But for me it was dumb, dull and boring!","6/10"

"Fast & Furious","paulclaassen","26 July 2020","Just like the original 'The Fast and the Furious', this film starts off with an impressive truck heist scene - this time a big oil tanker. Although - here - they are pushing reality to the limits.'Fast & Furious' is best viewed as a direct sequel to 2001's 'The Fast and the Furious'. Justin Lin is back in the director's chair. Brian (Paul Walker) is again working for the FBI. Dom (Vin Diesel) and his sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) are the only original members back for another round. Dom's girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriquez) as well, but only for a very short while. Han (Sung Kang) is in the film's first moments as well, and might seem confusing if you've seen 'Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift' before this.The film revolves around a drug lord, Braga, who needs racers to transport a shipment of heroin from Mexico to the States. Off course, Dom and Brian are selected, along with a few others. While Brian investigates Braga for the FBI, Dom investigates Letty's murder. There's constant rivalry between Brian and Dom and they're not the friends they were in the original film.'Fast & Furious' is not as easy to follow as 'The Fast and the Furious', but there are a few interesting twists, especially regarding Braga towards the end. There's loads of action and amazing cars. The Mexican desert scene was incredible, as well as the finale with cars racing through an underground tunnel from Mexico to the States. Well done.","8/10"

I think this film deserves 6.5 stars, even though I have to say that it was much better of what I expected.Dominic and Brian meet again and join forces, the first one to get revenge for losing a very close person and the other to catch the boss of a drug mafia ......6.5 stars = regular +","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","Buddy-51","18 April 2010","""Fast and Furious"" is the 2009 sequel to 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious"" - though, apparently, the two definite articles in the title aren't the only things that have gone missing in the follow-up to the original. Absent too is any sense of tension - however slight - that was generated by the fact that undercover L.A. detective Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) wasn't who he appeared to be in the first film's admittedly rather hackneyed storyline. Here former foes O'Connor and bad boy Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) are working together to bring a heroin dealer - responsible for the death of Vin Diesel's girlfriend and partner-in-crime (Michelle Rodriguez) - to justice. Meanwhile O'Connor may be rekindling the romance he had with Torreto's sister (Jordana Brewster), a woman he spooned then spurned in the earlier installment.Of course, one doesn't go to a movie like ""Fast and Furious"" for the scintillating dialogue, the astute character development, or the Stanislavskian acting. One goes for the nonstop car chases (not to mention the scantily-clad bimbos) and, in that respect, at least, this one delivers the goods, at one point turning the greater downtown L.A. area into a giant pinball machine for souped-up, tricked-out roadsters (though Mexico actually gets most of the hot car action here). But even that becomes fairly mind-numbing after awhile. And the movie itself is instantly forgettable.","8/10"

"Fast & Furious","chaos-rampant","12 July 2013","Tokyo Drift was all about the flashy driftworld of youthful fantasy, rooted in sex, rooted in finding the necessary ego. It could have been something, if only the story ropes weren't tossed without passion or curiosity to bring back something more than mass and noise.This is something else. Cars are, of course, central again. The women and exotic locales, this time the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Vin Diesel is back, so we get heroics of a more action-y nature, guns and kicking. We get revenge as a main narrative engine and the Feds on the trail of a dangerous drug-lord from Mexico, which do even less to distinguish the film from the bulk of crime action films. The film is generic crime, only more unrealistic.It makes a real difference, however, if you can put aside the absence of what you pretty much knew was not going to be there in the first place, it means you aren't bothered that it's not playing your favorite Debussy at the r'n'b pool-party. The party can still be a helluva time.It's all about the gravity of speed and crashing things for me, extended to eye consciousness.This is a more elaborate notion of realism that I'm talking about, I mean the stunts themselves are unbelievable if you pause to think of what you just saw, it plainly defies physics. It's all about gravity in the eye. The first scene is characteristic of this, our team is hijacking a gas truck en route, one is up on the truck breaking off the wagons which have been hitched to another truck running in reverse which then can speed off with the payload. We are so beyond physics here, that at one point the (unmanned) truck swerves seemingly by itself, metaphysically, to hit our guy's car. It works.Unstoppable is the pinnacle of this mechanized eye craft because it 'looks' to both story metaphor and inner urges, but this is pretty damn good for just the excitement it generates, the splintered image. The story is crisp and compact, moves fast sketching a world with simple mechanics. It's only the narrative support so cars can whizz by, screech, swerve, and bump into things. The camera similarly spins, whirls and shoots by, flying shards slicing our sight.The template for the car fantasy is, naturally, The French Connection.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","twpain","6 June 2020","Overall rating 7.0: I think this movie sets the tone for the Fast and Furious movies after this. It's fun seeing most of the original cast back in this one. Some of the scenes drag a bit to me but for the most part it's interesting. The third act is pretty good with the tunnels is pretty cool. The films villain isn't bad as well but definitely isn't the best in the franchise. Overall I think the fourth outing is a good enough movie with some good action scenes.","2/10"

Trouble is that there is no story except for a series of car chases and fighting.There isn't even really a semblance of a plot.

"Fast & Furious","Neenee-b","11 April 2009","There are times when a movie can be fully overshadowed by its trailer - Miami Vice is one, X-Men3 is another, (although the flaws in that movie will haunt for the rest of my time in this life and the next). Fast and Furious is one of those movies. The trailer far exceeds the movie in terms of action, acting and excitement.I have to make it clear I didn't like The Fast and The Furious, I have never even seen 2 Fast 2 Furious but I loved Tokyo Drift but there I was on opening night in a completely packed out screen one.The movie starts off so well, straight into the action with a good car heist. Then the action stops for what seems like forever so that we can get the obligatory back story of this movies villain. This is a normal process in any movie but Fast and Furious' main flaw was that its two male leads cannot act. They look good running, they look good when they are driving, they look bad-ass when they are frowning but for the love of god don't give either of them more than two lines of dialogue per scene!! After some awful awful scenes with dialogue we were treated to the second of (only!) four car scenes in the entire movie. The race scene should have been filled with great driving stunts and action but it was broken up to much with bad cutting, the insertion of strange CGI mapping effects and was narrated by Sally Frickin' Sat-Nav. I'm sure Johnny-Special-Effects loved making the road map for the audience to follow but seriously, stick to the driving - giving the audience a heads up that Vin Diesel and Paul Walker should take the ""next right"" really just took away from the excitement of the scene.The dialogue was woefully written and wasn't helped by the cast who really should be seen and not heard. The wittiest quips were sexualised car innuendos but that was to be expected but the smug look on Vin Diesel face every time he uttered one was like watching a monkey figure out how to use a knife and fork. For the love of god Vin you make a reasonable action hero but do not kid yourself you can act or are in the slightest bit amusing.The plot didn't matter. I love my movies but when I go to see an action movie I expect action. I don't expect, especially given the acting talent that we had the pleasure of watching, proceedings to be taken too seriously. Fast and Furious wasn't supposed to believe it was a serious drug crime movie...it was supposed to be an action movie with lots of good car scenes. There were to many gaps between action scenes and these were mostly filled with the most unbelievable bunch of FBI agents, including Paul Walker and some rather amusing scenes of Vin Diesel trying to portray emotion.When the driving scenes came they were quite good, although nothing original was to be seen anywhere on screen and judging by the imaginative title idea of just dropping the ""the's"" I don't know why I was surprised. The cars, of course where the most gorgeous items on screen, that's right the cars, even those that had exploded and were in flames still had more screen presence than Paul Walker could only ever dream of having.The cars stole the show and when the cars were actually allowed to race they were awesome.I would give the movie 5/10. If it wasn't for the fact that the cars were fantastic I would've been out of there. Skip Fast and Furious and go straight onto Tokyo Drift which had better action, better actors and had at least the common decency to embrace the fact that it was a movie about cars and fun and not pretend to be a drama with a few car scenes thrown in.Fast and Furious failed its MOT. See Vin you aren't the only one who can make a car pun.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","GOWBTW","24 April 2009","Fast and Furious rallies up the high octane in speed and performance. Vin Diesel is back from the ""Tokyo Drift"" scene, and is badder than ever. He's hardcore, and very vengeful in this sequel. The reason is when his lover and fellow racer, Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) got killed, and Dominic(Diesel) wants the killer, BAD! Along with the FBI Agent, the action has just began. The agent was involved in other races in the past, he's ready to join the fun again. To me, the real stars of the movie are the cars, in my opinion. I liked the Chevelle SS, The Mustang Corbra, the Dodge Charger, and several others in the making. I liked the desert scene where the the drug cartel and the drivers battled it out. Pleny of WHAM! BAM! & BOOM! It's a shame when Dom gets life without parole, I think the judge should be impeached. This movie is non-stop all the way, it never lost its value whatsoever. This movie is for adrenaline junkies of all sorts. 3 out of 5 stars!","6/10"

You watch it, and it is just car races and scenes. It's a boring film, with the only interesting scenes being with Vin Diesel and the car races. In fact, the cars didn't even interest me as the title aims to do. It is very dull and terribly underdone, with clichés and little character development. I did like the cast and the races, but I had many problems with this movie that I can't simply express. Midway through, I was falling asleep whilst thinking to myself 'the weirdest thing is that I actually wanted to see this!' My only advice is to skip this if you like something more than mindless plots and characters, and a film that tries so hard to be as 'sexy' as possible but ultimately falls flat, leaving you walking out disappointed and annoyed, or entertained as hell","8/10"

The Movie opens to an exceedingly amazing action sequence where Dom n his friends, including Letty try to do what they are best at.......yup u right heist.........WOW!!! what a scene. Right after that the movie takes a serious path for a short while. Where Dom leaves Letty sleeping n goes away from her n goes to Panama. That's where he receives a bad news about someone's death(i won't disclose it) but it was a shock.......coz dat was d best character in d series. He then sets out to track down the one responsible. In comes Mr O'Connor looking like that something has changed and believe me it has changed for the better This 'New Model, Old Parts' is working. The action sequences are perfectly shot, Direction is cool, acting was amazing, Vin was cool as ever, the jokes were on the right place and in the right proportion. I thought it was better than Fast And The Furious(part 1).Although in the fast paced movie the script wasn't given much emphasis. But who needs a detailed script if the screenplay is damn good and can keep you on the edge of your seat.I go for 8 out of 10 for Fast and Furious 4.........The Fast just got Faster.....and how.GO WATCH IT!!!........coz u won't regret......","10/10"

Since I'm not one of them, I tried to view it as objectively as I could.The first five minutes rock indeed - a masterwork of ""road-action"". But, once we get over them, and the REAL ACTION begins, all goes constantly down, to ultimately fall sort of flat. The main failure remains what was purported to me, in the movie-writing terminology, the ""main event"": the demented car race trough the Los Angeles traffic - much below what it should have been! Between the chases and other hot-wheels scenes, the story-line is uselessly complicated, and the directing, correct and nothing more. Points again for he stylish animation of the final credits. And this should be all. Sadly inferior to ""Death Race"", for instance, which DID KNOW how to deliver to motor-fans!","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","ryanskywalker-87402","15 April 2017","The longer a franchise goes on, the more likely it seems to fall into one of two patterns. Lucky series continue to build on the strengths of their predecessors, adding to the good and removing the bad for an increasingly good experience. Unlucky series find something that works early on and stagnate, refusing to innovate for fear of losing their magic. Somehow, with Fast and Furious, the FF series straddles both of these patterns at the same time. Series' mainstay Brian O'Conner is back and is now a federal agent working to break up a cartel run smuggling ring in Los Angeles. However, when the same cartel kills Dominic Toretto's girlfriend Letty, Dom returns to his home turf and two reluctantly team-up to take down the bad guys.If that plot sounds familiar, there is a good reason, it is literally the plot of the first two movies sewn together. From the first you have Brian working undercover alongside Dom, the LA setting and the street races. From the second you have the bitter rivals forced to team up to bust up a drug operation. Despite the fact the the story takes zero steps forward narratively, the whole thing actually works. This is mostly because the series is starting to mature. Sure, the camera still clings to the rear-ends of half- naked women with a pubescent glee, but the dialogue is far superior to anything in the series so far, there is real character growth and the dramatic moments work more often then they don't. If you need an example, just take the scene in which Dom describes Letty to an interested cartel enforcer named Gisele, the scene is almost heart- breaking and is miles above anything found in the first three films.To match the stronger writing, the cast bring a better game as well. Paul Walker really hits his stride here, trading in his poor faux machismo for a more reserved, thinking attitude, giving room for Vin Diesel to handle the tough guy stuff. Both actors work great together and manage to sell the improved dialogue well. The action scenes still aren't amazing, but returning director Justin Lin steps his game up from Tokyo Drift and keeps things entertaining throughout, though the CGI has already started to age a few years out. The soundtrack is even a little better, still filled with loud and angry rap and rock, but better, less obnoxious song choices then entries past. The only thing not improved in the slightest is the villain, who is just another one-dimensional drug kingpin, seemingly the archenemies of good, honest street racers the world over. Fast and Furious may have lost the ""the""s from the title, but is has gained some quality to its filmmaking and for the first time I can see why this series was able to become a tent-pole franchise. Here's hoping that as the next entry sheds more words from its title, it gains even more high caliber filmmaking.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","EchoMaRinE","21 July 2009","The story focuses drug sellers this time and Paul Walker teams up with Vin Diesel to bring them down. It started great. The plot was as good as such an action movie can have but car scenes were not as good as the first one. There were not so many cars as well. The first movie was great but after that, they started to make the movies just for money. This one was better than the last two though. I must say there was too little surprise and a very predictable end. I couldn't catch the spirit. It is an OK movie as itself but it is definitely not better than the first one. Vin Diesel also looked a bit emotionless. Some dialogs were longer than they should be. The first movie is still casting a great shadow on the new ones I am afraid.","8/10"

This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares?It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :)Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re team with Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed! When fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to avenge a loved one's death, it reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But, as they race through crowded city streets and across international lines, they must test their loyalties by joining together to bring down a shared enemy. From big rig heists to precision tunnel crawls, Fast & Furious takes you back into the high-octane world, which lives for speed, drives for the rush and breaks all the rules!""Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.""This film is more about stopping a notorious drug lord Arturo Braga and avenging the murder of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). This film is set back in Los Angles when everything started, after 5.years of leaving the city of Angeles for Dominican Republic after Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew become a Wanted Fugitives. Letty was murdered when she was mixed up in a drug racers mule cartel. She knew the people who hired her, will double crossed her, while trying to escape the flying bullets she was killed by a drug lord's henchman. That weary angrier Dom (Vin Diesel) brings him back to Los Angeles, to avenge his loved one's death and tracking down Drug Lord Braga and killing him. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), is now an FBI agent, and he is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Both men faces each other in a final showdown. Braga is looking for a fast drivers that are driving and smuggling trough desert New Mexico drugs. Brian goes again undercover only to find out that he and Dom (Vin Diesel) are been double crossed and set up on the same way that was Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was.This film is filled with full action, fast cars, full of stunts and beautiful women. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Gisele Harabo it was her first role in this film and she was awesome, she acted the character terrific. Paul walker was the best in this film, finally, finally they did something with the character, he become an FBI Agent which I love that with the character In this movie. I love that Dom (Vin Diesel) at the end of the film didn't run, he surrender and I love how Brian ( Paul Walker) was testifying for him in the court. Seriously this film Kicks ass, although I prefer Fast Five over this Action Flick, but that doesn't mean this film did not do the job right, it did! And this film is highly underrated and criticized by critics. Also Han (Sung Kang) has a small scene in the beginning of this film, that was before they killed the beloved character in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).The rating I am giving to this film is 9. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","vengeance20","9 August 2021","Saw this back in Cinemas in '09 & while I couldn't remember much about it until I seen it now after 12 years, it came back to me & by Christ it was ace!The Film follows Brian O'Conner, back working for the FBI in Los Angeles, teams up with Dominic Toretto to bring down a heroin importer by infiltrating his operation.I found the film to be a decent entry to the F&F Franchise! There's plenty of action, hot babes & st hot cars to get you going! It's great for what it is! At 95mins it's pretty good & before films went wk, this is epic as f!I mean, compared to the later entries, it's not amazing, but it's still a pretty good F&F Film!7/10.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","Carycomic","5 April 2009","For one thing? There was the action-packed prologue. It had stunt work worthy of a James Bond movie. And, more importantly, it had a rare case of faithful continuity. Not only did Michelle Rodriguez return to play Letty. Sun Kang (as Han) was back, too!**Making it appear that it was set a year or two before F&F: TOKYO DRIFT.Another thing this sequel had going for it was the return of Paul Walker, as Brian, and Jordana Brewster as Dom's sister, Mia. Eva Mendes was undeniably nice to look at, in 2F/2F. And, I'm sure, as Agent Fuentes, she provided a great release for any sexual tension Brian might have felt. But, Brian and Mia had much better chemistry!They proved this when they had their dramatic reunion in that little diner. I was wondering what he'd say when she demanded an explanation for his emotional betrayal of her. And, I was not disappointed. As far as I'm concerned, Brian's reply was delivered with complete believability!Of course, the _best_ thing this sequel had going for it was the return of Vin Diesel to straightforward action-adventure! Oh, he proved he could do light-hearted, family-friendly spoofs of it in the Disney flick, THE PACIFIER. But, I suspect the main reason he appeared in that film was just for the sake of professional variety. To prove he wasn't just a Right Said Fred look-alike who could take a punch (and dish it back out, twice as hard).So, if you haven't already seen it, go for it. The only way you could dislike it is if you disliked the first three movies in the franchise, as well.","7/10"

I'm not sure how anyone could down rate this movie unless they actually are intending to. You know what your going to go see when you go to see a title like this. I was pleasantly surprised.

"Fast & Furious","BigBirdtheBum","28 April 2009","The latest installment in the adrenaline fuelled The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast and Furious is quite possibly the weakest of the quadrilogy, but it does manage to dish up in fairly decent portions what made the first three films such a hit with younger viewers. So in a sense this installment like the others will definitely be well received amongst its legions of eager, young fans. If that's all you want to know- stop reading. If you are a more casual film goers, I urge you to read on. Now of all the ""Fast and the Furious"" films the only one I actually enjoyed was the first in the series. So really I was not expecting much when viewing the film, but I expected better than what I saw.Fast and Furious is not a sequel nor is it a prequel, it is an interquel (a film set between two films in a series), in this case it takes place between ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and ""The fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". Within minutes we are reintroduced with familiar faces; Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), but we are also introduced with what now seems to be the ""cancer"" for films- excess CGI. This CGI replaces traditional actual car crashes and replaces them with pathetic CGI representations. One particular atrocious scene involves a bouncing flaming tanker rolling down a steep road towards Dominic and Letty. They avoid the flaming death trap in a ridiculous way, but let's get into that later. Now this sub-par effect is caused by Dom, Letty and others attempting to steal a very large petrol tanker. Predictability sets in and the tanker crashes and one of the large tanks of petrol it was moving rolls down a large decline towards Dom and Letty, who are enclosed on the road on three of the four sides. To the left there is the flaming remains of a crashed tanker cab, and to their left a rock wall and behind them a cliff. They have no choice but to speed towards the bouncing tank and drive under it. Normally this would be a moment of tension, but it's not as the audience is aware that they will come out of it alive and well, I mean it stars Vin Diesel they wouldn't kill him of in the first couple minutes would they? I've wasted enough time on this scene, I had better move on.The heat comes down on Dom and his crew after the hijacking and they are forced to flee. One of his crew Chan, who fans should remember from Tokyo Drift decides to go to Japan, while Dom decides to move to Panama. In Panama Don is alerted via a phone call that a friend (who I will not reveal) has been murdered in the USA. In a vengeful rage Dom travels to the states to pursue the murder. The Murder turns out to be a drug lord Arturo Braga. Coincidently this is the same criminal who a now FBI agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is after. Dom and Brian initially infiltrate the organisation that traffics drugs from Mexico into the US, by loading them into cars and making them zip through an underground mine at the US/ Mexico border. Now keep in mind this section of the border is heavily monitored, in addition to the mine being relatively dangerous to navigate at high speeds. So why a drug dealer would risk millions of dollars of drugs, by trafficking them in the most stupid way I have ever heard of is beyond me. Perhaps they just wanted an excuse to show off some close-ups of cars and Paul Walkers hand on a gear stick.As Dom and Brian's time together increase they become friendlier towards each other, similar to how they were through the majority of The Fast and the Furious. Now I was glad to see this relationship develop in the movie, but was disappointed at the way it was handled. I would have preferred it if Dom was more hostel towards Brian in the beginning than he was in the film, as a far better sense of drama could have been generated. This would have attracted some praise from viewers looking for something more than any of the other movies in the series offered, without affecting fan enjoyment.Overall enjoyment of this movie would be limited only to those who are fans of the first three movies. If a fan of those sees it I can almost guarantee that they will enjoy it. Other audiences will probably not feel the same way leaving the cinema, instead they will probably notice the absurdity of the plot, its poor effects as well as its often flat acting (from Diesel in particular). Hence Fast and Furious receives a 4/10 from me, and I am being quite generous as I think it is still able to appeal to its age group.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","Enchorde","1 December 2009","Recap: Unable to stay in the US Dominic Toretto and his gang take their operation to Latin America. But after their latest heist, the hi-jacking of a fuel truck, they begin to feel the heat even there. To save her from the fallout around him, Dominic leaves Letty and vanishes in Panama. But the news of Letty's murder bring him back to the States, in vengeance. Apparently the drug lord Braga is responsible, and coincidently old acquaintance Brian O'Conner is in a FBI task force to bring the same Braga to justice. To get close to him, they must infiltrate Braga's organization that seem to need an endless supply of skilled drivers.Comments: The first in the series was a rejuvenation to the genre, and in some ways even something of a pioneer. Since then a few sequels have been made, none even close to the original. Now the original gang has returned and especially Vin Diesel brings some of the luster back. But what was once new and fresh and thrilling soon becomes tedious when nothing new is brought to the table. This installment of Fast and Furious has a decent story, some good action but brings little new. When the solution to everything is a high speed car chase, it does seem a little simple minded after a while. And it certainly doesn't seem that thrilling as it once did.Yet, it is good entertainment. Vin Diesel certainly knows how to do it. What is unfortunate is the continually small parts Jordana Brewster gets. She might be the most talented of them all (this from previous movies), and got a fatally alluring smile to boot.Even if it doesn't have any new ideas, the old ones is still entertaining. And at the end I almost wished that another sequel will be made. One hopefully with roughly the same cast, but with some new ideas.7 revved up engines out of 10.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","jaybob","17 September 2009","This film is pure action fantasy.Pay no attention to the story.

This makes up for it.Justin Lin directed from Chris Morgan's screenplay.Vin Diesal & Paul Walker are a great team. There will be a part 5.Of the 106 minute running time, I would hazard a guess that 75 of those are taken up by Auto chase scenes.

"Fast & Furious","MLDinTN","28 February 2010","after watching this movie, it would appear so. I really liked the first F&F; it was really neat with all the cool cars and driving stunts and it at least had a descent story line. Now with this sequel, there was absolutely nothing new. The cars aren't near as cool and the story line is trash. Vin Diesel was an up and coming star in the original. Now, his career has gone no where and he's forced to be in this sequel when he thought he was too good to be in the second sequel. And Paul Walker is certainly a looker, but his acting ability has gotten him no where as far as starring in big films. His line delivery is as bad as ever in this.FINAL VERDICT: Very disappointing when compared to the original. I wouldn't care to watch it again.","6/10"

"Fast & Furious","eric262003","15 February 2010","Well going into the fourth part of the franchise, there are two kinds of people that have watched the series, those who really loved the movie and those who write smut just to dampen people's spirits so that they're persuaded by those hacks to hate the movie. ""Fast and Furious"" exceeds everything ""Tokyo Drift"" ever stands for, and even surpasses the original and its awful sequel ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" which was nothing but a showcase of chase scenes and nothing more.This movie is a prequel to ""Tokyo Drift"" and is a follow-up to the events from the first movie by approximately five years. Unfortunately, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is thrown in the slammer for freeing conman Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel)and how this lead to the sequel is beyond me.During that time Dom and his squeeze Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have settled in the Dominican Republic doing what they do best high-speed hijacking which shifts into an exciting opening scene where Han (Sung Kang) gets involved leading to the events in ""Tokyo Drift"" even before the movie gracefully commences. A death tragically lures Dom back to Los Angeles where he once again encounters Brian who's back with the FBI and here we go again, another series of fast-paced chases and bringing down the bad guys. The antagonist in this story is a drug dealer on the run that Brian is in hot pursuit of. The dealer relies on street racer drivers to do his evil deeds. At first Brian and Dom are racing against each other, and then collaborate to take down, their adversary. The improvement come into the adjustments in character as Dom and Brian have grown into each other and they levelled the into their maturity level over the years. Walker has become more serious and focused as he's lost that ""tubular dude"" attitude to a more ""let's get down to business"" persona. To me that's believable after all you think by now he's lost that personality after years of experience. And here I think he has.Diesel who has been in a few duds is welcomed back to the franchise possessing his comfort zone and has become more humane and caring. We know he lives on danger and he knows it himself which makes him less self-serving than even James Bond himself. We see him perform and we can see that he's yearning to be more than just an action hero, though people would rather see him in only those kinds of films rather than to see him actually act.Director Justin Lin is back and delivers the same high-octane energy from the previous instalment adding more fuel to the cars and complimenting the driving effects with eye-candy visuals. And the slower parts don't drain out like what weakened t5he premise of ""Tokyo Drift"". It's still a few inches short from the first of the series, but it steps up the plate as one the more better of the other sequels. But you had to take some adulation from the first movie to fully appreciate this one, or else you think this just another repetitive action flick.","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","CinemaCocoa","13 April 2017","It is back to the beginning, back to familiar faces and a surprisingly serious tone for the series. But we still get a stupid naming committee. Yeah, Fast and Furious isn't at all confusing when looking back at the series, is it the first, second, third film? Who knows! What's wrong calling it The Fast and the Furious 4?To make things more unnecessarily complicated, Fast and Furious is a prequel/sequel, taking place after the first film but before the third film (so it should technically be No.1.5) due to Sung Kang's character Han returning to the series. Whether it acknowledges the second film or not is ambiguous.When running from the law begins to get to him, Dominic (Vin Diesel) is looking for revenge after a drug dealer kills his partner Letty. At the same time, the FBI is looking for the same man, spearheading the operation is a reinstated Brian O'Conner. Naturally, the way they must infiltrate this heroin ring is through the dealer's love for performance car racing. I'm happy to see the return of the moodier tone; this feels like a direct sequel to the first film rather than a spin-off or a parody. A lot of the film is set at night with deep shadows. They even made Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner bearable! His character is rejected from the others since the first film and he starts out as more of an anti-hero lawman. I was quite surprised at the apparent restraint at glorifying the cars themselves; the camera seems to linger less over them as the film ploughes through its exposition and story. Of course that could just be me desensitized to it  I have watched four of these films now! It still has the usual trappings, don't worry.It is ultimately a solid story and a decent sequel to the first film, if you liked The Fast and the Furious you shouldn't have any problem with this. This does make the series more traditional (persistent narrative) which is a shame; the reason I enjoy Tokyo Drift so much was that it offered a new direction for the franchise, an anthology franchise about driving, following different characters each time. But that's not the way to make money, but as it stands, this is good too.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","moldo_bmf","5 April 2009","The general plot of the movie goes something like this: Dom (Vin Diesel) and his buds are at it again and stealing gas from poor South-American countries (I would like to think that they're doing this to destabilize a government that is based solely on irony). However, Dom realizes he can't mess with the feds that are out to get him, so naturally he takes to the road and gets the hell out of Dodge. But not for long, since a plot device that we were SO not expecting brings him to good old L.A., and by complete coincidence, in the middle of an FBI operation that has to take down a drug lord. We are told that this drug lord effectively manages to smuggle more dope than Escobar did in 10 years. While that in it's own right would just have to be pretty freaking awesome, we have to remember the fact that Escobar was responsible for about 80% of the drugs coming in and out of America in his time. Which kind of makes it obvious that this new drug lord would have to effectively control either half the U.S. fleet or literally be able to s**t transports on a daily basis... However, the movie wants to make us believe that he can do so with 4 guys a night, racing through a tunnel that just happens to be outside of the Mexican border's scanners, all the while running down from Mexico to America... Of course no one would think to post sentries there...As it turns out, Dom and Walker (Brian O'Conner) end up working on the same case, albeit for totally different reasons. In the end we get a plot twist that we SO didn't see coming, and an ending that just screams for another sequel to be made. Normally I'd say HELL YES! to something like that, if the movie had been what I expected. Read what follows to see why my response was something more on the lines of ""I'll see another one of these if you guys let me in for free. And give me hot chicks... or at least a free soda."".Why directors will choose to take the fun out of an otherwise brainless movie is something that will always manage to elude me. It somehow falls into the same category as things like why I can never find magical leprechauns that will hand me money or why some studios green-light scripts that smell of brain-fart from a mile away.I mean... I can totally understand that the movie chooses to pimp slap reality while screaming ""Who's your driver daddy!"" (I sometimes like to believe that it also throws in a sucker-punch every now and then), because that's what makes it fun. But then again, if you walk into a ""Fast & Furious"" movie expecting realism, you probably deserve the aforementioned treatment yourself... applied by Gremlins (because we all know how terrifying a Gremlin screaming ""Who's your daddy"" would be).Just to get this out of the way, I like cars. I love tuned cars. I love hot women that choose to wear belts as skirts, or wear dresses that don't have enough material to cover up 30% of their body. And if the movie had 90% of that and the rest had been composed entirely of Vin Diesel kicking a** and taking names while displaying absolutely no remorse or guilt, then I would have loved this movie. So much so, that I probably would have given it a 10 just for being composed of THAT much awesome (ok maybe a 9 because it just wouldn't have been in the same class of awesome as ""The Dark Knight""... unless one of the racing cars was the Batmobile, and the chicks around Batman had been dressed in Catwoman outfits).But no... instead we get 30% car racing and general bad-a**, 20% of Vin Diesel looking as if he's about to s**t bricks considering how muscularly constipated he looks, coupled with general bad-a**, and 50% I'm-sorry-for-banging-your-sister-and-then-taking-off-without-even leaving-a-note tear-jerking dialog that was hackneyed at best and cringe-worthy at worst. It basically sounded like a rejected sketch for a James Bond movie in which Sean Connery starts telling his newly acquired babe that it's too dangerous for her to stay around him, because he's got like... ninjas after him... or something. The reasons why that wouldn't stick are: 1. Sean Connery's brass testicles wouldn't allow him to utter such a thing.2. We all know James Bond probably doesn't care all that much.3. We all know WE wouldn't care all that much.In this case, reasons 1 and 3 apply more than ever. Why? Could it have to do with the fact that we get to know so little of the characters that we utterly can not give less of a rat's a** about them? Bingo! Because seriously... I didn't pay the admission price to weep at tear-jerking drama. I paid to watch fast cars and hot chicks. If I want depth, I'll watch ""Slumdog Millionaire"" or ""The Wrestler"", or ""Seven Pounds"". If I want hot spoilers and rims, and cars that have jet-engines put in them I'll probably just play Need for Speed. At least that game allows me not to care whether or not I kill innocent bystanders, let alone if any of the main characters gets dumped by their girlfriend or anything like that.","3/10"

Secondly, move along the action at the beginning faster, so viewers will not have time to realize the machinery the gas bandits are destroying far exceeds the value of the petrol--oops, this whole thing about the most valuable tankers in world history has me talking like Mad Max! Thirdly, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner just isn't furious enough. He looks like the sort of undercover cop they'd have in HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL--which is bad, since this is supposedly a much tougher crowd!

It was pretty exciting (the opening scene for example) but not what I was looking for when I went to the cinema.

"Fast & Furious","tomgillespie2002","29 January 2015","After the massive disappointment of the two sequels to 2001's dumb but entertaining The Fast and The Furious, the franchise got itself back on track by grounding itself (I use that term loosely) and bringing back the original quarter of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. Tokyo Drift (2006) was mind-dumbingly dull, but the action scenes were more impressive than what came before and it teased fans of the series by bringing back Diesel for a last-minute cameo. Director Justin Lin is at the helm once again, and this fourth instalment is the best yet (at this point in the series).Five years after fleeing Los Angeles, Dominic Toretto (Diesel) is up to his old tricks in the Dominican Republic with girlfriend Letty (Rodriguez) and Tokyo Drift's Han (Sung Kang). Sensing his presence in his new gang will only bring the law down upon them, Toretto flees to Panama, leaving Letty behind. A few months later, Toretto is brought back to America by an incident I cannot reveal with being spoilerific. He starts his own investigation, which leads him to a man named David Park (Ron Yuan). Meanwhile, F.B.I. agent Brian O'Conner (Walker) is also investigating Park, and all trails seem to lead to a mysterious drug lord named Arturo Braga.Though the movie begins with a rather ridiculous action scene that brought flashbacks of the terrible xXx (2002), things settle down as an actual plot - the first of the series? - develops. It's simple but effective, and everything from the cinematography to the script feels cleaner and more mature. More focus is granted for the characters, and although they're relatively stoic and wafer-thin, it's nice to see them exchange words in a room rather than shouting at each other over the noise of an engine. Fans of the franchise need not to worry though, as Fast & Furious, which is in danger of being the most unimaginative title to a sequel ever, offers plenty of motor-porn, scantily-clad women and a pumping soundtrack.Which is where the movie ultimately suffers. Although Justin Lin dims the sheen of street racing and shoots the obligatory gyrating lady parts with a less perverted and exploitative eye, the main crux of the plot still surrounds drug smuggling, a lazy McGuffin and a recycled excuse to get Brian and Toretto behind the wheel again. The action on the whole is exciting, especially the high-speed rush through an underground tunnel that crosses the Mexican-American border, and Lin manages to avoid getting lost in the mayhem. It will never be a work of high art, but there's enough here to reignite my passing interest in this glossy but fun series.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","i_am_momo","7 July 2021","Fast and Furious (2009) is alright. It is not the best movie out of the saga I've seen. Even though it is an action movie, it did not have as much action as before. I don't get why and how Brian is in the FBI. I miss the other characters from the second movie. I also miss the vibe in the first and second movies. Fast and Furious was boring in general.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","Ridonculous31","5 April 2009","Now that that's out of the way, this movie goes from ZERO to 90 in 45 seconds. Then it's off to the races my friend, where it doesn't let up 45 minutes later when your in the parking lot of your local movie theater driving off in your car. Forget what you know about the franchise, if you want an ADRENALINE rush it'll be TOO LARGE! You can say what you want about ALL THE originals coming back, but you know what they're a team and they bring out the BEST in each other every time. It's FANTASTIC to see Vin Diesel (DOM), Michelle Rodriguez (Letty), Paul Walker (Brian), & Jordana Brewster (Mia) all reprising roles that brought your attention to them in the first movie. I love that we're in 2009 and technology has brought movies to such amazingly great speeds & heights. I've never seen it used more brilliantly then this is 2 and a half hour thrill ride. Dom's on the run, Brian's back with the FBI, and Mia's holding down the home front back in Cali. Well it wouldn't be a reunion if they all didn't come collide back together in misfortune,racing, and the world's BIGGEST drug trafficker. It just wouldn't be FAST and FURIOUS. Great cars, hot chicks, hot dudes, fantastic action sequences, and the best acting of their careers! GO see it and remember why you loved the first one, and be impressed. I honestly was","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","mexicospidergreen","11 April 2009","Yes, all your favorite characters from the first finally have their reunion as they are all back in this fourth installment. It takes place 30 minutes after the first (which means 2 Fast and Tokyo Drift) took place after this. Now car thief Dominic Totorro (Diesel) and FBI agent Brian O'Connor (Walker) are out to catch a drug smuggling ring whose leader is a common enemy to both. After one character is killed, Totorro and O'Connor blast muscle cars and speed through the Streets of Los Angeles and even to the Mexican Desert to catch and infiltrate the ring, before it's too late. The latest installment is by far the freshest of the four. I really didn't like Tokyo Drift, and 2 Fast 2 Furious I missed, but this made me want to check out the first one again. This movie is every teen's fantasy: fast cars, girls, explosions, shootouts, it's all in there. Something like this should come out every Friday, but I don't think that will be possible. I know that the critics are being very harsh on this, but they're old, and open minded, so I think you should go out and see this for yourself. Plus seeing that this has already made 72 Million Dollars and is by far the highest grossing movie of the year, I can see it's time to get Fast and Furious again. Apart from the well shot action scenes, and real life stunts (Walker mentioned none of it was CGI), some of the dialogue was quite bad. I don't blame the director or any of the cast members, but parts of the script felt like it was written by 10 year olds. I don't expect real acting from these types of movies but I do expect at least some good acting, and this just didn't deliver it sadly. Fans will all be happy with the latest installment. It's miles better than Tokyo Drift, and although I didn't see number 2, this one beat the original to the finish line for me. You've got great action scenes and Vin Diesel finally back to a good role (I hope this movie treated you more than Babylon A.D did.) All I have to say is if you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Drive as fast and as furiously as you can to your nearest movie theater, and prepare for pure awesomeness.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","tburke85","3 August 2009","Fast and Furious is a flawed but decent action film. Director Justin Lin is admirable for giving audiences plenty of action/car races but the lack of some character development and over the top moments weigh it down. However this movie wasn't the disaster I thought it would be and if you're a big fan of the original you'll probably enjoy this one just as much. I'd say this one is on par with the original which had it's flaws as well. Vin Disiel reprises the role of tough fugitive Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker returns too as undercover FBI Agent Brian O'Connor. Disiel and Walker are decent as the leads turning in good performances whose characters join forces once again to take down a common enemy after the death of someone close to Dom. Jordana Brewster also reprises the role of Dom's sister Mia and she does an all right job in her very limited screen time but she isn't given much to do. The rest of the cast are okay in their extended appearances. Michelle Rodriguez returns for a brief appearance as Dom's girlfriend Letty but her role in the film is cut really short. She still turns in a decent performance though. The action, fist fights, and car races are well executed and the same can go for the way they're shot because there's not a lot of shaky camera movements so you can usually make out whats going on. Some of the action/chases do go over the top but I'm willing to suspend my disbelief because this is a movie about illegal street racing after all. The story was okay but some characters lacked development but hey I wasn't exactly expecting anything Oscar worthy stuff from this film. No offense. The dialogue wasn't the best occasionally either but the attempt by the lead actors and some of the action/chase sequences made up for it. This fourth film in the Fast and the Furious series really isn't that bad at least not me it just could've been a little better. Overall Fast and the Furious has plenty of action, car chases/races/crashes, some surprises, and solid performances by the lead actors. This film is sure to please almost any die hard fan of the original. With it's obvious flaws aside this movie was better than expected.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","Leofwine_draca","23 April 2012","The latest instalment in a film series that shows no signs of dying out – in fact, with each movie making more than its predecessor, it looks like we're going to be stuck with Fast & Furious films for a long time yet. I'm no fan of racing, and I'm not impressed by speedy or super-powered cars, so I'm in no way the ideal viewer for a film like this. And yet something keeps me coming back to watch each new film in this series, even though the experience is invariably disappointing.FAST & FURIOUS is a mixture of the good and the bad. A couple of opening sequences are evidence of this: the opening heist-on-a-fuel-tanker scene is an example of everything that's wrong with this type of movie. It's cheesy, completely over the top, reliant on dodgy CGI effects for impact and lacking the kind of high-octane realism that made the truck chase at the opening of the Thai film BORN TO FIGHT so good. And yet the subsequent foot chase scene, reintroducing Paul Walker's character, is actually fairly decent, adding a bit of free-running to the mix.What follows is hardly surprising, except in the killing off of a major character that you won't see coming. The ensuing events see Walker and Diesel teaming up one more time to compete in a series of illegal races set around the Mexican border, culminating in a madcap pursuit through miles of hidden underground tunnels. The car chases are the things that make or break these films, and it's unfortunate for me to report that they're too filled with poor CGI to be remotely convincing; the final race is a real disaster, with cars and backdrops all looking animated.Inbetween, there's the uncomfortable spectacle of watching Diesel trying to act, which doesn't really work – he's far better off keeping quiet or hitting things. Walker's always been a bore to me and that doesn't change here, while the villains are particularly bland. A tough fist-fight between Walker and Diesel is one of the highlights, and there are a couple of neat car crash stunts that don't disappoint either, but FAST & FURIOUS is one of those movies you'll forget all about mere hours after viewing. Can't wait for the Rock to show up now, though","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","Michael_Elliott","19 May 2013","Fast & Furious (2009) ** (out of 4) The fourth film in the franchise has FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) teaming back up with his former friend Dominic (Vin Diesel) so that they can try and bring down a drug lord sneaking heroin into the U.S.. FAST & FURIOUS will probably be enjoyed by fans of the series and I don't think anyone could argue that the film was poorly made. There's a very professional look and feel to this but sadly it's pretty much the same thing we've seen three previous times. We get a bunch of guys acting tough and cool. We get a bunch of fast cars. We get sexy women wearing tight clothes. We get the typical bad guy. We get some fast chases and of course the biggest is going to be saved for last. One really wishes that the filmmakers had tried to do something new here but instead they just stick to the formula and clearly it worked as this film became a huge hit. As I said, the film has a very professional look to it and especially when it comes to the car chases. If you can overlook the obvious CGI wrecks, the races are actually quite good and show a lot of imagination. The imagination shown during the races is important because it not only makes them stick out but it also keeps everything from being predictable. The story itself has the typical melodrama that you'd expect as there are several old topics that the characters are upset about and of course we've got to hear them fight about them. As for as the performances go, they're pretty much what you'd expect in a film like this. Walker plays the calm and collective fine while Diesel has no problems talking and walking slow. FAST & FURIOUS isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination but there's just not enough here that we haven't seen before.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","bob the moo","20 February 2010","I never set out to do it but somehow I find myself watching my fourth consecutive film in this rather undemanding franchise – proof if proof were needed that (a) the teenage dollar drives cinema and (b) I simply do not make very good decisions when faced with making decisions in a DVD store (""oh look a movie with stuff going bang – let's just get that""). In this film Letty brings Toretto back to LA where he reignites the his feud with O'Conner (now an FBI agent) as the two seek the same drug lord but for different reasons, using street racing to audition for a job running ""packages"".I can't really remember what I thought of the previous films but I'm guessing that they did the job, offering fast cars, stunts, video girls in skimpy clothes hanging off muscular and tattooed men, providing me with distraction on this basis but little else. The fourth film offered me some interest as, let's be honest, it represents a slump in the careers of all involved – especially Vin Diesel who was supposed to have gone on to claim the action hero mantel from the first film, only to fail at almost every turn and end up right back where he started. Anyway, enough of that because in theory that should not reflect on the quality of the film.This film seems like a step back towards more of a ""thriller"" that the first film was as opposed to the pop video that the series became by the time Tokyo Drift rolled round. Of course this is all relative because this film still has elements of pop video, just this time it is a touch less obvious and does deliver some reasonable action sequences. I say reasonable because the film is still nothing particularly special. The high point comes early with a rolling robbery which, while good is not as thrilling as it could have been – which doesn't bode well for the rest of the film considering this should have been a brilliant opening. As it is the film delivers the obvious but perhaps does it well enough for target audience. The cast match this aspiration and could easily have been asleep for some parts of this. Walker is a bit less bland than in other performances and does a solid enough job. Talking of solid, Diesel shows all the charisma and presence that reminds me why his career has failed to take off – he is dull in the most part. The support cast aren't really worth mentioning beyond these two – nobody does anything to really mark themselves out.A solid genre film then. Fast cars, explosions, stunts, video girls, a little bit of plot and that's your lot. Not bad per se, just the sort of film that you don't want to be making a lot of effort to see – because that effort will not be repaid here.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","furiousneon","4 April 2009","The first Fast and the furious movie was something like a phenomenon for me as a teenager. It had amazing cars, gorgeous girls and introduced two stars to the mainstream audience, Paul Walker & Vin Diesel. The second film only brought back one of them..and while it wasn't terrible, the vibe and energy from the first seemed to be drained out due to this actors presence missing. I wont even begin to explain my disliking of the third film aside from its direction, because we would be here for hours. Finally, for whatever reason, maybe money, maybe careers not going where they were supposed to, these two guys came back together along with their love interests from the first film..and I, for one, am happy that it went down. The action sequences are top notch, easily the best in the series. The cars are AMAZING..if you are a car guy you will flat out love the choices in the film. The acting is..well, tolerable. I read reviews for this film laughing out loud. It sounded like critics were expecting Slumdog Millionaire. Come on people..its the fast and the furious. It is supposed to be fun, loud and exciting. Not Oscar worthy. I don't want to give away anything like most reviews do because i know fans of the series would rather see it for themselves. It is satisfying and i would say, almost as good as the original. For its action sequences, pace and overall feel..i give the film a 10/10.","6/10"

This time, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) must work together again to avenge the murder of Toretto's lover Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez) and apprehend drug lord Arturo Braga (John Ortiz).It's rare that a series of movies finally finds itself in the fourth installment, much less gets that many chances. But here you go - these movies really start becoming beloved right here.Sung Kang shows up as Han Lue, Dominic's right-hand man, bridging the last Japanese side of the franchise, while also introducing Gal Gadot as Gisele Yashar, a liaison for the evil Braga. Laz Alonso also shows up as Fenix Calderon, Braga's right-hand man who murders Letty and sets this whole movie's story arc in motion.This movie paved the way - pardon the road pun - for the other movies in this series. In fact, it outgrossed The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift in its first weekend.Of course, Letty wouldn't stay gone long. But we'll get to that soon enough.","7/10"

"Fast & Furious","ajs-10","4 April 2010","I have seen all of the previous films in this series on TV, I'm not a huge fan and so I won't go out of my way to watch them. I am, however, a bit of a fan of Vin Diesel, he seems to ooze that certain charisma a film star should have. He appeared in the first of these films, took a bit of a sabbatical for the second and came back for a brief cameo in the third. So it was with some anticipation that I watched the return of his character, Dominic Toretto in this, the fourth instalment.Dom and his gang are in the Dominican Republic and up to no good; they are hijacking fuel trucks to sell the fuel for a profit. Included in the gang is Dom's long time girlfriend Letty. Having just pulled a job they get word that the police are onto them and Dom decides it's best for them to all go their separate ways for a while. They do this until the day Dom gets a call from his sister, Mia, telling him that Letty has been killed. Meanwhile, FBI agent Brian O'Conner, who was featured in the fist two of these films, is investigating notorious drugs dealer named Braga. It seems Braga is using drivers to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border and it was while working for him that Letty was killed. So both Dom and Brian have reason to get in with Braga, Dom, for revenge and Brian, for justice. They both try out as drivers and succeed by one means or another. It's now a case of how do they get to the illusive Braga. I'll leave my little summary there or I'll give the whole plot away!This is a pretty well made film with lots of car stunts and quite a lot of CGI work that is pretty well done, but does, at times, look a bit like a video game. You'll know what I mean when you see the tunnel chase near the end of the film. As ever Vin Diesel was very good as Dominic Toretto, as was Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner. Honourable mentions go to Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, Michelle Rodriguez as Letty and John Ortiz as Campos.I'll admit it's not the best film I've ever seen and so it won't be making any of my top tens at the end of the year. But it does what it says on the tin, it's got lots of car chases and there's plenty of testosterone flying about. The chases were exciting and well executed, when they didn't use too much CGI. I can't recommend it very highly, but it is entertaining and it won't tax the grey cells too much.My score: 5.4/10","4/10"

ACTIONAdrenaline seems to have been lost after the first one! They returned two of it's original characters of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker but still didn't return the original director of the first witch is Rob Cohen who compromises with it's actors to make the overall film work! Plot is original which involves the transport of drugs and etc... from hired drivers, but it doesn't really match the enthusiasm what director Rob Cohen did from the very first one of this franchise. It is one of those movies when one's waiting for something exciting to happen with the next scene just as good as the last.

"Fast & Furious","Uriah43","23 January 2017","Although this movie is the 4th in the series, the story actually takes place between the 2nd and the 3rd films with ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) and his girlfriend ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez) having relocated to the Dominican Republic where they make a living by hijacking trucks transporting gasoline on a local highway and selling the fuel for a hefty profit. Meanwhile, ""Paul Walker"" (Brian O'Connor) has just returned from a successful operation in Miami and is now helping the F.B.I. in Los Angeles in its attempt to capture a notorious drug lord named ""Arturo Braga"" (John Ortiz). However, when Letty is killed by one of Arturo's men, Dominic subsequently returns to Los Angeles to take revenge upon the people involved. Soon both Dominic and Paul run in to each other and begin working together once again. Unfortunately, the cooperation between the two of them isn't fully sanctioned by certain law enforcement officials and as a result Dominic has to be on his guard at all times. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although the plot was somewhat predictable, it still had some good suspense and a couple of surprises here and there to keep things interesting. Likewise, having two attractive actresses like Gal Gadot (as ""Gisele"") and Jordana Brewster (""Mia"") certainly didn't hurt the scenery in any way either. Slightly above average.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","Boba_Fett1138","14 June 2011","It's amazing how much better this movie is compared to the series its previous entry ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". Amazing, since bother movies are made only two years apart form each other and are directed by the same director, Justin Lin.But it's not just that this movie is better, it's also a very different movie. You could say this movie went back to its roots again, since it featured the same main characters and actors out of the first movie, made back in 2001. It's why some consider this movie to be the one true sequel to the popular first movie.And it's really a welcome thing that the actors of the first movie reprise their role in this one. As weird as it might sound, I missed Vin Diesel's star power in all of the sequels. The movie benefits from its presence and it uplifts the movie. The movie feels better balanced out with his presence and it for instance also makes the Paul Walker character work out better, as compared to his role in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".But it still also actually differs from the first movie as well. You could say that with this entry the series matured more. All of the previous 'Fast and the Furious' movies were made for boys who wanted to be man but this movie is actually for man who are truly man already.It's still a movie with fast cars but the racing aspect gets pushed somewhat to the background. There is actually a story this time around, that involves plenty of action. Not that the story is much good or interesting but it at least makes this movie different from the other ones and in my opinion also better to enjoy.And yes, it really is the action that foremost make this movie such a good and entertaining one to watch. In the previous movie I had a hard time figuring out what was going on half of the time during the races but all of the car scenes in this movie and its action just in general are shot really well and the movie is filled with some spectacular stuff. It's still dumb and big all but it at least is all being brought in an entertaining package.It makes me hopeful for ""Fast Five"".6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","freemantle_uk","18 April 2009","This is my first experience of the Fast & the Furious franchise, and I have to say I found it an dumb, but fairly entertaining experience. Fast & Furious takes place after the first and second films, but before the third: an interquel which is a very rare thing, even in Hollywood.The action starts of in the Dominican Republic, Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Han (Sung Kang) are stealing petrol so they could sell it on the black market. The heat is on them and they all have to go their separate, Han going to Tokyo, Letty to America and Dom goes to Panama city. Brain O'Connor (Paul Walker) is an FBI agent who is working on a case to bring down a Drug Cartel who import heroin from Mexico to America using tunnels and street racers. Letty ends up getting murdered by the same Cartel and Dom and Brain work together to bring the group down.The plot is ridiculous, it's thin and is not the way a Cartel would work. I can not picture tunnels being build under the American/Mexican border without the American authorises knowing or the tunnels being big and stable enough to drive cars in them. The acting is standard, no one really stands out for the right or wrong reason. Vin Diesel is the strongest performer. What makes the film work is the action sequence and the director Justin Lin does it with joy. There are some good races, and other action set piece, including shoot-out, which action-junkies would enjoy. However some scenes, especially the race in Korea Town, felt like it was trying to be Grand Theft Auto the movie with the way the cars were driven the GPS graphics. The action scene in the beginning reminded me of the petrol stealing scene in Mad Max. But the action is the strongest point of the film. In the UK the film has a 12A rating (PG-13 in America), but personally though the film should have gone for a 15 (R) rating because it wouldn't really affect it audience, and allow the filmmakers to show more sex and violence. As well Justin Lin really like to show girls kissing each other (I wonder why).Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster were all in need of hit after some unsuccessful career moves. Vin Diesel was doing some really after films, Paul Walker only has Flags of Our Fathers to his credit and Michelle Rodriguez only did a year on Lost. Its good to see Vin Diesel backing doing what he does best.The people who will enjoy this film the most are men who masturbate over cars and women (in that order).","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","mm-39","7 April 2009","More the same. Lots of eye candy both human and auto in this film. A thin formulated by the numbers script. However the stunts were OK .

If one includes Walkers acting and the stunts The Fast and Furious, is it four or five, is entertaining. My wife like the movie. However I found the movie just OK; A movie rental night film.

"Fast & Furious","Shattered_Wake","15 June 2009","The ""Fast & the Furious"" franchise has gone through a downward spiral since the original was released in 2001. This original, ""The Fast and the Furious,"" combined both great car scenes and action sequences with a solid and interesting story. From there, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (2003) was made solely into a brainless action flick, and ""Tokyo Drift"" (2006) had very little going for it at all other than some good-looking cars. When news came out that ""Fast & Furious"" (2009) would be released with the original cast, but with the director of ""Tokyo Drift,"" the worst of the franchise, I was uncertain how it would do. Luckily it succeeded.While the story is a bit convoluted due to some poor storytelling and explanation, it, like the original, works on the levels of an interesting story and a thrilling action flick. The acting, as expected by the cast, works for the film. They clearly won't be receiving any Oscar noms any time soon, but for ""Fast & Furious,"" they work.The action sequences, though the CGI looks a bit lame at some points, are extremely exciting. The car chases & races are bigger than those from the original, and the film is chock-full of ""hot cars and hotter women."" As a man who needs a good script to enjoy a film most of the time, I can't give this one the edge over the first of the series. . . but, it's definitely up there with it.Final Verdict: 7/10.-AP3-","6/10"

"Fast & Furious","StevePulaski","9 December 2015","In my review of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, I elaborated on the inevitability of The Fast and the Furious's fall from the roots of its original two films. The first two films emphasized a strong sense of plausibility in its circumstances; when I say that, I mean that it resonated with its audiences in a manner that had them seeing themselves on-screen and the kind of ridiculous car tricks and stunts they attempt to pull off when they're with their buddies. The chemistry of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel was undeniable, and the charm at hand was enough to sustain an entire film. The inevitability I spoke of in my review of the third film was that this series would slowly drift away from that focus and, in turn, be more about pushing boundaries and becoming a glossier, more implausible action spectacle than keeping the kind of down-home feel of the original films.Fast & Furious, which, yes, is the fourth film, indicated by the lack of two ""the""'s in the title the franchise used up until this point, turns a fun and amiable series, thus far, into a gritty, CSI-style drama. It morphs into a primetime drama with some seriously expensive street-racing sequences that, again, somehow solve and uncover the most layered drug busts and thefts across the continental United States. The result is a film that, after probably the best opening scene of the entire series so far, slowly spirals into the drudgery of senseless mayhem and cheerless characters.Poor Paul Walker has even sacrificed all the coolness and nonchalant mannerisms from the first two films to become one of the flattest actors on screen here, lacking all emotion. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that, from my count, Walker's Brian O'Conner character gets beat up three times in this film, and at one point, takes a serious beating after a carwreck. The fifth film of this ostensibly neverending franchise should open with the maimed Walker and his comrades in the hospital struggling to swallow Vicodin with miniature plastic cups of apple juice if it even wanted to replicate anything close to realism.Walker's Brian O'Conner has been reinstated to the police force, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has been relaxing in Panama City for the past few months when he gets a call from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Dom's mechanic/girlfriend, was killed in a potentially pre-meditated car accident. Brian's investigating leads him to the name of Arturo Braga (John Ortiz), a heroin kingpin intent on smuggling copious amounts of heroin from the U.S. to Mexico. Brian and Dom, who are now rekindling old enemy territories with Brian returning to the force, must attempt to work together to avenge Letty's death, with Dom also trying to remain out of trouble and stay away from police with his fugitive status.As stated, the opening scene of Fast & Furious takes the cake for the franchise's strongest, most entertaining opening thus far, and possibly the best scene in the entire series all along, as well. The scene involves Dom, Letty, and the remainder of his crew attempting to steal fuel tankers off of a big-rig truck, which is hauling six or so. The object is Rico Santos (singer Don Omar) and Teo Lego (Teo Calderón) to maintain speed with the rig in their vehicle so that Letty can hop aboard the truck, freeze the rig's connection to another rig and smash it with a large wrench, which would allow it to properly latch on to Han's (Sung Kang) truck for safe-keeping. Trying to elaborate on the interworkings of this scene is difficult in itself, but watching this unfold is every bit an action film fan's dream, especially during the harrowing, incendiary conclusion.This scene is the indisputable highlight in a film that greatly falters because (a) it takes itself far too seriously for a film about street-racing, (b) doesn't have the actors nor the narrative weight to make this film anything other than a dime-a-dozen story of a group of guys trying to stop the Pablo Escobar of (insert drug or illegal activity here), and (c), forgoes profiling the admirable energy levels of its performers. Fast & Furious is about as much fun as getting to the final lap of a race, maintaining your speed, putting your vehicle on cruise control, and then flipping radio channels to see what you can listen to while you miss all the excitement and fun that got you there in the first place.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Don Omar, Teo Calderón, Sang Kung, and Michelle Rodriguez. Directed by: Justin Lin.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","southdavid","24 June 2023","Fascinatingly, after two sequels with lower budgets and diminishing returns, for whatever reason, the Fast and Furious franchise switches gears (pun intended) and starts us down the road towards the wild and crazy world we're in now. This one is still relatively tame, but watchable enough.When Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is killed, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) returns to Los Angeles to investigate. Also investigating is Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is now an FBI agent looking into the operations of a Drug Kingpin Braga whom Letty was working for when she died. Both Brian and Dom attempt to infiltrate the cartel, using Ramon (John Ortiz) who finds drivers for Braga, as their route in. There is only one spot on the team though, and they must race to decide who gets it.So yes, it's all still relatively lacklustre at this point. They're no longer knocking of DVD players, but the villains are still just drug dealers rather than limitless international terrorist organisations. Dom's already getting into superhero mode though, as he's shot at one point in this and just shrugs it off. Despite saying it's relatively grounded there are three characters in this film who will come back from the dead at some point in the series! There main four characters are all back though, along with Han, who heads off to Tokyo after the opening scene - making this a prequel to Tokyo Drift - an idea which was again retconned later on. Gal Godot joins the cast as Gisele though there's little in this particular performance to suggest that she would be coming back again after the end of this plot. Laz Alonso is also in the film, as Braga's right hand man Fenix and though he has a memorable death, he gets to do a lot more as Mother's Milk in ""The Boys"".Even with all that awful Pitbull Music, the film isn't bad and is watchable enough. The stunts are getting better and the characters are starting to accumulate into ""the family"" that will feature in the next six films. Onwards to ""Fast 5"".","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","dogankurban","5 May 2009","I have watched all the fast and furious movies. This movie is, I think, no better or worse than the other movies of the series. The good thing about the movie is, Vin Diesel acts in it. The bad (or worse) thing is that the movie is such a big cliché. When some character says something, you can just guess what the other character will give as a reply. When we see letty in the first place, we just guess that she will die and dom will run after some revenge. The movie is very expectable from the beginning to the end. Another bad thing is that there are less cars and less workshop scenes than the other fast and furious films. Also, the supporting characters aren't as eccentric as they were on the other movies. The tunnel scenes were really good, which seem to have given some difficulty to the effects people and to the stuntmen. Overall, this movie is just your standard fast and furious movie, no more no less. Just the movie to ask for if you like Vin Diesel, girls kissin', modified cars and some action scenes.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","CinemaClown","2 September 2015","The fourth instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise and third in line when it comes to series chronology, Fast & Furious follows the events of the second film and works its way backwards to connect with whatever transpired in Tokyo Drift. And while it does bring back the original cast, the story is so dull & forgettable that it marks a new low for this franchise.Set 5 years after the events of The Fast and the Furious, Fast & Furious tells the story of Dominic Toretto as he returns to Los Angeles after learning of a tragic news while Brian O'Conner on the other hand is now a FBI agent and has been trying to track down a Mexican drug lord. As the two meet again & realise that they have a common enemy, they team up to infiltrate into his gang.Tediously directed by Justin Lin, I get it that this sequel is Lin's attempt to close the gap he himself created between the last two instalments but apart from seeing the original cast on screen again, there is nothing worth watching in this movie. Even the chase sequences are tiring & timidly filmed, visual effects are not wholly convincing and performances by its reprising cast is an absolute letdown.On an overall scale, Fast & Furious is the weakest entry in the long-running franchise so far and everything this unnecessary sequel tries to do only ends up working against it. Despite having seen it less than 24 hours ago, I've already forgotten most of its plot, can't recall anything that was impressive about it, and never for once cared about any of its characters. Bringing nothing new to the table, Fast & Furious is a sequel on a standstill.","2/10"

"Fast & Furious","bottleHeD","4 April 2009","Really, Fast & Furious is plain misleading, the title should have been Slow n Plodding. What an absolute drag.Exhibit A - Directionless director. With random hand-held camera, incredibly jerky footage, fast cuts all over, you never really get to see anything good. Of the cars at least. The races seemed like they were directed by Michael Bay. Every thing kept exploding and crashing. It was horrible!Exhibit B - Dom's double chin. Humungous, monstrous double chin. Bigger than his bald head. A mutant double chin. His evil doppleganger, even. Sure, I'm being superficial here, but it's a movie, and your job is to look good. Dom is tough muscle-head. A double chin just looks plain ugly!Exhibit C - The story. I think there was one, but I could be wrong.What was real good to see on the screen was some very nice mid-riff closeups of Michelle Rodriguez. Plus that other skank who shows up halfway through the movie, falls for Dom, and thrusts her real hard nipples towards him. He still turns her down. Go figure.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","Thanos_Alfie","15 November 2013","The ""Fast & Furious"" is a really great movie because it has much an action and that makes it interesting and it also has mystery about all of the story from the beginning and now. The combination of these two makes this movie one of the greatest ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies.In this movie we see Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) helping Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is working for the FBI and to solve a case about a crime that made in Los Angeles. It's a movie in which we see many things change and some new things happened that will affect all of them.Finally ""Fast & Furious"" it's a movie a little different from all the others from this ""series"" and I think that with this movie starts a new era of ""The Fast and the Furious"".","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","Floated2","5 August 2009","So, before actually watching this movie, I had high expectations. The movie sort of lived up to it, although not that much. This is a pretty good movie. A lot of action, deep drama, common-sense dialogue. This is pretty much a little grown up movie. This is definitely not a video game kind of movie (nothing like Tokyo Drift).This movie is definitely recommended for all younger people if you like or not like cars. This movie also doesn't have too much racing, which isn't that great. I think it would have been better with more racing instead of a major story plot. The ending was nice/Fast and Furious is more of a serious movie than I expected and the character development is well. I was expecting non-sense 24/7 racing with no dialogue, which it wasn't like that. It turned out alright but not really what I was expected. Hopefully the 5th movie in the series will be better.
As a rewatch 06/03/19' Fast and Furious is solid and more serious than the previous films in the franchise. The action is there as well as the chemistry with the original cast back but the overall plot wasn't nearly that entertaining, and somewhat did drag on.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","thestig1","12 April 2009","I would never call A fast and the furious film good cinema. But then again its not trying to be, its simply A hot rod movie. That means that it doesn't need a plot or good acting. What it does need however are A hand full of ingredients. Fast cars,beautiful women,lots of driving stunts,and an experience that leaves the viewer entertained if not a little dumber. The original The fast and the furious is a case in point example. however the seres took a turn for the worse when they tried to introduce plot to the films. plots just don't work for a car movie. But then the savior of the seres arrives. Number 4 finally we have Paul Walker and Vin Diesel teamed up again. The ubber cute Jordana Brewster is also back. So how did it fair? well lets break it down. first the cars, There was a decent collection. there was another Skyline,A ford torino,a nice Bmw,and of coarse the 1970 Chevell common maybe but I was happy to see it because that is what I drive. then there was a the collection of oddball cars like the Gnx the camaro called the bomb and a few enthusiasts may have noticed the lamborghini suv. but for all the cars none of them really had an impact on me. who can forget Doms Rx7 or the bright orange Supra from the first film they where the stars of the film along with there costars the jetta and the charger which made a reappearance in this film but just didn't seem to be the same. second the girls, there where some nice looking girls thru out as id mentioned earlier jordana from the earlier film is back and she alone is worth the watch so really no problems in that area. how about the fun car stunts. this is a place that i had few issues. one there was not very many race scenes mostly just some oddball driving blips scattered thruout and those where covered in so much CGI i couldn't even enjoy them. last this movie took its self a little to serious its a car movie not a crime drama. and lets face it Vin Diesel and Paul Walker both offer big screen presence but are nether one what i would call good at acting. So don't try and make them act by trying to show an emotional side. To sum up i wish that the series would go back in time all the way to the year of its birth 2001 and make a carbon copy of itself only then could i finally say that the series is fun again.","2/10"
"Fast & Furious","cgvsluis","30 May 2023","This is the fourth entry in the Fast and The Furious franchise and it really goes back to five years after the first film revisiting our favorite characters Dom, Brian, Letty, Mia and we see Han again. The on screen chemistry or camaraderie is still there between Brian and Dom...and Brian and Mia.Brian has his FBI job back and the cops are hot on Dom, so Dom leaves Letty who ends up dead. Dom comes to Letty's LA funeral and goes after her killer. This puts him on a collision course with Brian who is also trying to take down a big time drug dealer named Braga.There are more great driving stunts and just some great stunts altogether...fight scenes, explosions...and definitely some great cars, all held together with a thrilling soundtrack.Dominican Republic, Mexico and LA are all backdrops for this great fast and furious reunion. This might be my second favorite film (next to the first) in the series thus far.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","SoumikBanerjee1996","10 June 2023","This fourth chapter may have had numerous shortcomings, but it succeeded in establishing, or should I say revitalising, the ties between our main leads.I have always admired the pairing of Dom and Brian; their friendship and brotherhood worked marvels over the years, and it's one of the main reasons why I kept returning to the series and never grew tired of it.If Paul had not met with such unfortunate and untimely demise, I do believe this series would have produced more positive outcomes. Brian as a character would have had lots of room to grow, could have had opportunities to flourish, but I guess, it wasn't meant to be, as fate had other plans for him.R. I. P.

"Fast & Furious","TheMovieDiorama","29 May 2018","Fast & Furious 4. Fast & Fourious. 2 Fast 2 4ious: Tokyo Drift. What a way to reboot a franchise, by literally removing the definite article from its title. Someone give that person a medal because sweet lord it didn't work. Dom joins forces with Brian to bring down a drug cartel in Mexico who happened to have been involved with Letty's death. Wait was that a spoiler? No, it's in the trailer, synopsis and every other critic review, plus everyone has essentially tackled this eternal soap opera by now. After the ""masterpiece"" that was 'Tokyo Drift', director Justin Lin takes back the series by ensuring Dom and his crew return for some high octane action. Yes? No. Granted, the car chases were well filmed and are always exhilarating to witness but I expected nothing less. It's the franchise's trademark. Whether it be street racing through night time Los Angeles or rampaging through urban Mexico, always thrilling when it's also accompanied by pounding techno beats. It gets my blood flowing. Unfortunately though, that's all this chapter has going for it. These returning characters are portrayed with such monotony and dullness that actually I didn't care for any of them. Diesel can grumble all he wants in a bid to enhance the physicality of Dom, yet he is a boring protagonist. Brian acts as his lap dog and, again, is boring. The antagonist was generic, same can be said about the plot which was ever so reminiscent to 'Point Break'. The acting was functional although Brewster, bless her for having her name on the front cover, was useless at conveying any emotion. The extent of her emotive acting is a smile at the end. Nice! The atrocious visual effects detracted from many of the action scenes, particularly the Mexican border tunnel chase. It resembled something you would find in a PlayStation game, y'know those polygonal cutscenes. It's neither fast or furious, it's just really really dull. Fortunately the franchise picks up substantially in future sequels!","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","joshuadrake-39480","23 April 2015","After The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, a sequel with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster returning was put into production and would not be released until April of 2009.The story sees Dom and his new crew hijacking fuel tankers in the Dominican Republic, but he believes that the police is high on their trail. Meanwhile, Letty is killed in a car accident and this leads into Dominic and Brian coming together once again to find her killer and make him pay.I'm not gonna say this movie was bad, but I kinda hate and love this movie at the same time. What made the action work previously is the car chases and underground racing, but that is still present here, so I can't blame this movie for not having car chases.The over-the-top action is just lazy, except for the climactic car chase at the end of the film and the chase between Brian O'Conner and a criminal at the beginning of the film in Los Angeles. I saw previews of this movie online and on TV and I had mixed feelings when I watched this for the very first time.The music is just cool. I give Brian Tyler a lot of credit, but I don't want to talk about the entire musical score for the film.The acting is kind of a mixed bag of popcorn and gummy worms for me because some of the actors do their job and some of them does not.I give credit to the four main actors who play the four main characters even though Michelle Rodriguez does not have a lot of screen time, she does a very good job. The film saw the return of Sung Kang as Han Seoul-Oh and to tell you the truth, he does a great job. Gal Gadot plays Gisele Yashar and she is a new introduction to the film series, but unfortunately, she does not have a lot of screen time either, but does really good.The villains played by Laz Alonso and John Ortiz are okay, but Laz Alonso was miscast in this film. Nothing against him, but I like him in Stomp the Yard and Jumping the Broom, but this is the only film that I think he did not work. John Ortiz plays Braga in this film and he gives a good decent performance, but even then, it's incredibly over the top.So, overall, I have mixed feelings about Fast and Furious 4, while I like the music, story, action and some of the acting, I can't get over the fact that the Letty Ortiz character was killed off. I give it a 5 out of 10, because they tried their best and I don't think it's as bad as people say it is.Now, if the movie would have been 124 minutes long, it would have been fine.","9/10"

Pretty much, right off the bat I was glued to it.Soo much happens in the beginning. Like the opening scene for example, when they're stealing the gas. Then to kick it off and give the movie a plot, Vin Diesels girlfriend gets killed off. They really thought this one through, this time.The action is great. Amazing cars and high flying. The ending is excellent. I like how they pull off the first scene idea, in the ending scene.VERY well done. I thought it'd be good. It was great! 8/10","6/10"

"Fast & Furious","Kingslaay","1 June 2023","Despite this film being the first time Dom and Bryan reunite since the first film, this film leaves a lot to be desired. Letti's death is emotional and enough motivation to drive Dom and the film. But I felt it could have had more of a plot or additional storylines to make more interesting. Also Dom, despite being a stoic character, does not show the audience he's that affected. We don't see enough emotion and intensity that supposedly exists. The action scenes are also a bit of a let down and insults the viewers intelligence. We see some unrealistic action scenes and a lot of plot armour that shields the main characters and villains. Overall the film felt disjointed and it abruptly transitioned from one scene to another and a lot plot points could have been explained better, the viewer had to quickly piece these together to assume what was going on. A weak entry in the franchise.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","talllwoood13","26 May 2022","I thought this was the first movie and honestly wanted to see the appeal as in middle school or really early high school it seemed you HAD to see this movie.. well.. I watched the wrong movie first in the series. How did anyone think this was a good idea to call the movie ""fast and furious"" instead of coming up with some clever name. If some other studio put out a movie they'd run to their lawyers and sue.Vin Diesel is so boring in this movie. It's like he doesn't want to be there. He just mumbles through every line for a pay cheque. How could anyone want him to be a leading man? What's his appeal? Does he look ""legit"". He looks like a mixture of Ron Pealman which many of you may know from Sons Of Anarchy or Hellboy. As well as Bruce Willis or Steven Seagal. He can't act to save his life.The plot is so uninspired even if I spoiled it, it doesn't matter, it's that dull where a hundred movies have done a similar plot but better. There are a few cool car chases but it just SCREAMS direct to video especially how many scenes are recycled. They heavily rely on some tunnel. The cars weren't very impressive and the worst thing going for this movie is the dialogue seems like it was written by someones 14 year old son. The last time I saw insults back and forth that bad was in middle school. The cars are forgetful other than the green one the bad guy (i think) drove and of course whatever greasy car Vin could get his mitts on.Skip this one.","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","k-dhesi","14 May 2009","Finally a great new action flick with intense action scenes and cool driving. Right? Wrong! Fast and Furious was not all bad, it had it's moments. But still something was missing, something was just not the same. Going to see this movie i too was not expecting so much, it's the fourth instalment of a cool series, So it's not easy to keep the Furious of the movie going. Although it was a tad step up from Tokyo drift (Fast & Furious 3) which to me might of killed the series. Yes it's great that the majority of the original cast from the first one are all back, and it's great to see that. I thought it would be something to look forward too, and it probably was, because the original cast such as Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster & Michelle Rodriguez, saved the movie from a huge flop. And obviously the cast is the audience puller, which made people watch this film. But the good acting, didn't change the lousy plot of the film. Some action and racing scenes were quite intense (partically the end) but the movie seemed weak and the fun of the movie was not involved in this 4th instalment. Maybe a OK film to rent, but not really worth it for the big screen. A slight let down from Fast and Furious part 1 and 2. But better then Tokyo Drift no doubt. 6/10","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","dvc5159","8 April 2009","The latest installment in the high-energy Fast and Furious brings back the original cast to the franchise that made them stars. The result - the strategy paid off, this outing is the best of the sequels, and I find myself wondering whether this is the best F&F movie. It's a good, VERY solid, no-holds-barred action movie.While the plot may be a slight rehash of 2 Fast 2 Furious, it's (mostly) the cars who steal the scene here. Like most of it's predecessors, the cars move through busy streets and off-roads like a hip-hop dancer. Let the cars do the talking, I say. The producers thought it would be a good idea to bring Justin Lin back on board as director after Tokyo Drift, up until now the most carefully shot of the franchise. Well, his kinetic and lively direction paid off, and he's an action director to look out in the future. The cinematography is wide in scope and the editing rarely at times feels rushed and pulls you into the film without force. The music from Brian Tyler (again from Tokyo Drift), also fits the moments. There is a number of action sequences, and while some may find the number of actual illegal street races little (one, in fact) disappointing, fear not, as the other action scenes with cars in them more than make up for it, especially the final action sequences. There are obvious moments of CGI, though, but Lin and his crew pull it off in a way it makes it enjoyable.Most of the actors, for most of the time, do NOT out-act the cars. In fact one returning star's character is underused and another's wasted. But the two REAL leads steal the show (barely) from the automobiles, namely Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. Since he's producer as well, he makes sure when the cameras are on him, they show his X-factor potential to the fullest. What made Diesel into a bankable action hero is proved here, he has a tough body, a macho voice, and a charming personality to boot. This, is his TRUE comeback to mainstream action after the laughably inept Babylon A.D. Fans of Diesel would be glad to know he's back kicking a lot of ass in the film. It's almost ""The Vin Diesel Kicks Ass Show"". The other actor almost stealing the limelight is Paul Walker, the other lead, who seems to be more aggressive in his role as Brian O' Connor. Who could blame him? The first F&F was meant to make him into a bona-fide star, Vin Diesel stole the limelight from him. This is evident in his post F&F movies (Running Scared (2006), anyone?). Anyway having Vin & Paul back together makes all the difference, as they portray characters in which anyone can root for.So for a fast paced, popcorn munching good time, , buckle up and hang on for a Universal thrill ride. What the story lacks, it more than makes up with it's cast, it's action, and most importantly, it's cars. Girls, cars, and bling, oh my! It's the best of the sequels, and it may be the best in the series.Entertainment value: 9/10Overall: 6.5/10","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","IPyaarCinema","13 May 2023","The subsequent films in the Fast and the Furious series always have more thrill and action than the preceding film. As is customary, the movie's opening sequence bursts onto the screen with the most action and tension. The first-scene action makes it possible for viewers to fixate on the screen the entire time. It was the best in the franchise so far, I was actually surprised with how much plot was in this movie and there seemed to be more importance focused on the story. The acting was better than any of the other 3. For any fast and the furious fans this is not a let down but another awesome film.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","Holt344","6 June 2021","Fast & Furious 4 is the movie in the Fast & Furious franchise that changed my mind on the films, they found their footing and made it an success at the box office. I also believe it's the turning point and I mean how it ventured out of the racing and into heist, crime and action. Not that I'm complaining, it fits the characters and world they have built from the first and second film. F4 is written by Chris Morgan and directed by Justin Lin. It is a direct sequel to The Fast and the Furious whilst being a prequel to Tokyo Drift. The latter whom Justin Lin also directed.The film is again focused on the core characters of Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner,
Letty Ortiz, Mia Toretto, Gisele Yashar and Han Lue, whom are portrayed by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang. Whilst the villain, Arturo Braga/Ramon Campos is played by John Ortiz. The story goes deeper into the characters and the main theme of family, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang is a great addition to the cast, Sung Kang previously starred in Tokyo Drift which takes place before Fast 7.Earlier in my review I wrote that there were more focus on heist and action. Well F4 is about races and cars too so if you're a fan of that then you'll be excited, there's some very cool cars in this one. The action sequences are bigger and better than ever, higher budget makes that happen. Whilst the action gets better, the logic behind certain things reduces and the characters like Dominic Toretto becomes strong like an ox and able to get shot without even a flinch... Action films like these likes to make it more entertaining than realistic but I won't lie, I still enjoy the movie and will continue to recommend it. Some bad writing and bad acting is alright for a film like this one, Gal Gadot improves immensely though in the next films. The editing is fairly good and so is the pacing, nothing but praise for them on those fronts.","6/10"

And the actors/actresses play the roles so well that it'd make you think this is so real. I really love the series and especially this movie because the action was great and each time Justin Lin makes a movie, he made sure that it's perfect.

Its the same tried and tested formula, similar to the 1st two movies. I don't see the Fast and Furious series movie this way. Tokyo Drift brought something different to the table, which I've to give Justin Lin the credit for it. This movie however goes back to the preview plot outlines of 1 and 2. Vin and Paul don't bring conviction in their roles, which I feel they probably opted for this movie for the sake of it.On the whole its popcorn fun. You get to see fast cars, hot chicks and good action sequences.I rate it 6/10","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","ethanbresnett","27 March 2022","Fast & Furious is a solid instalment in the Fast franchise.It benefits from bringing the two best characters in the franchise back together, Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto and Paul Walker's Brian O'Connor.The complicated but blossoming brotherhood between these two men is explored in this film, and this bond and theme of family is a cornerstone of the franchise so it's good to see this being developed.The action sequences and driving stunts are all very enjoyable. A step up from the first few films, but not quite reaching the ludicrousness of later instalments.Justin Lin demonstrates that he really understands this franchise, making an energetic film with a pacey plot, decent twists, and plenty of exhilarating action.All in all this makes for a very fun film, and lets be honest if you are watching a 'Fast' film and are expecting more than just fun then you are barking up the wrong tree.","8/10"

I just couldn't really get that into it. While this may not be the case with some people, I find these characters to be mostly shallowly written and I just don't really care about them. The action in these films is easily the best thing about them, and there were a couple of pretty cool scenes with Vin Diesel toward the end which I enjoyed. I also liked the presence of some actresses like Gal Gadot and Jordana Brewster too. That's about it though, but I'll try to keep watching. I know that the action at least can for sure get better and better! Just a question of when I will start to actually care about the characters and story.","10/10"

Then you see Dom on a prison bus, but behind it you see 4 tuned up cars racing up behind the bus. Then it shows O'Conner and Doms sister, and a few other people. Then the movie ends. I really hope to see more Fast and the Furious movies with these two in them. It was simply amazing, I strongly recommend going to the theater and seeing this movie.

"Fast & Furious","raulfaust","28 June 2011","First off, I think they shouldn't be making actions scenes in the very beginning of any movie. Putting up a story first might be more interesting for the viewer to understand what's happening.""Fast & Furious"" is different from it's predecessors. While the others were more focused on teen experiences with speeding cars, girls and drug traffic, this one prefers to put lots of action scenes and attract the older audience. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just saying it's different from what I expected (based on the previous films). The action scenes are much more intense than they were in the past, thought the cars aren't that amazing anymore. Or I'm getting used to seeing speed cars every time, or they're not improving them anymore. Either way, this movie will probably entertain you and the end will give a nice clue of how the next plot's film is gonna be. Give it a watch anyways...","8/10"

"Fast & Furious","Jithindurden","28 April 2023","This is probably the first film from the franchise I saw and it does feel like this is setting up to be a real franchise while the three films before all kind of felt stand-alone in some way. This is as good as the first one in my opinion even though it moves away from what made the first one a bit special and leaned into the more glossy aspects but it works very very well here. The action setpieces are all wonderfully done but the editing bogs this down a bit. It kinda felt like they are too focused on making it feel tightly packed that they edited out a lot of important stuff. The last chase scene especially felt a bit weird with the editing and there were many moments where the events and timeline felt a bit off which I assume is due to editing out stuff that should've been in there. But it is a very entertaining movie and if not for the editing issue, I would have put it above the first one.This is also where the retconning in the franchise started. Han came back to show Tokyo Drift would be happening after this. But that event and all the main character motivations in this movie coming back in the future to get retconned again seems really lazy from here when I think about it because when I saw them randomly I didn't even remember most of it. Let's see how the franchise holds up now.","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","OMTR","12 May 2023","The saga continues to improve with the return of the original cast and Justin Lin who is directing his second film in the series after 'Tokyo Drift'.The screen story is also more developed by abandoning the puerile tone of the beginnings in favor of a more mature story, which is developed into a classical action film, solidly acted by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Laz Alonso and Gal Gadot in her acting debut.The franchise has therefore moved up a gear and is heading towards promising new adventures as long as they present such a level of quality.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","daworldismine","13 December 2009","the first the fast and the furious is one of my fave movies ever, the second one was in my opinion a piece of crap, while i enjoyed the third and loved the ending, i thought it was great for vin diesel to appear in it, and that gave me high expectations for this fourth installment, and did it disappoint, hell no, this is the ultimate sequel to the original movie and it's got a great story and i think dom and Brian's friendship is stronger than ever. now let's get one thing straight this movie ain't really about street racing anymore, this is basically jus a movie about these characters nearly ten years later, and it's fantastic now don't worry it might not be about street racing but it's got enough breathtaking car action it dosen't disappoint, now the story is really about dom's girlfriend letty getting murdered, an event witch pretty much leads to all the cast bieng re united, and kicks off the story, now to me in it's core this is just a vin diesel revenge pic and in many ways it is, but we know these characters we love these characters and the film is action packed from start to finish they have topped the first 3 in terms of action easy, all in all a solid sequel that does justice to the first film and bieng everything a sequel should be, bigger,faster,furiouser its top quality entertainment. vin diesel is back in top form","3/10"

"Fast & Furious","RCWjr","16 April 2009","The 4th film in the F&F franchise is a winner. Bringing back the original cast (well, most of them) was the only way to keep the franchise going. The previous films were not ignored, but were expanded on here.The film starts out with a great chase sequence (which is to be expected here). We are then given an acknowledgment to the 3rd film, which leads us to believe this is what happened back home when Han left to head over to Tokyo.The film plays out pretty much like you think it would. We are given some intrigue this go around with Dom and Bryan (now working with the FBI)trying to track down the people who have killed a mutual friend. This leads to Dom and Bryan going into a new kind of car scene, that of drivers running ""packages"" back and forth across the Mexican border.A total compliment to the previous 3 films. It will be interesting to see how they bring the 5th film to fruition. There is talk of setting it in Europe. It would make sense given that at the end of the 3rd one, Dom is in Japan.","3/10"
"Fast & Furious","Sirus_the_Virus","2 September 2009","Fast & Furious is the fourth film in the series. It definitely makes up for the bombs that were 2 fast 2 furious and The Fast and the furious: Tokeyo Drift. I think though, that the newest film is flawed. I lost track of the new film. I also lost a bit of interest in the last half hour. I thought that there was too much action for a Fast and the furious film. There is more action in the opening scene than in the rest of the trilogy. I've never really thought of them as action films, I don't know what they were. I will admit that I liked the new film, but it wasn't really worth the 6.7 that it received. Also, the dialog is poor. Like in most action films, but this film goes a bit farther. I appreciated how the original cast returned, but I didn't really appreciate the film much. Though it was better than the last two films, it wasn't fantastic. it wasn't as good as the first one either. The film just didn't feel like a Fast and the furious film. It just felt like an action packed vendetta that featured cars. I didn't feel The Fast and the furious in it. It was just a noisy, action packed film that featured cars. It would be a 5, but I liked it because I appreciated that the original cast returned and it was somewhat entertaining. It's a **1/2 out of ****. Despite it's flaws, it somewhat works.The Plot: In the 4th film of the popular series, Dom reunites with old acquaintance Brian O'conner when a loved one dies. The two try to track down the killer.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","educallejero","25 March 2019","Even the atrocious Tokyo Drift wasn't boring, it was just bad at everything, insulting even, but not boring. This one tried to have a more complex plot/story, with character development and emotive scenes, but without better actors and written dialogue and without sacrificing any second of ""car scenes"". It failed.Some of the things kind of worked out:
-Toretto solidifies himself as a ""sensitive good"" criminal with a good arc in the movie, (even if probably a bit forced)
-Brian finally goes full on criminal
-The plot exists and is dense. There are plenty interconnected subplots that end up in a coherent way.But getting those things right, only provoked bigger problems:-A more complex plot required a lot of boring scenes filled with exposition.
-A more complex plot showcased how unbelievable the whole thing is. The FBI in particular felt impossibly fake
-A more complex and emotional plot required more acting from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, and they are just terrible actors.
-A more complex plot without any realism and depth and overall point (no social commentary, no ideology, no political discussion) gets boring and takes away minutes and chances for more comedic scenes (more appropriate for this franchise)","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","phubbs","22 November 2014","Isn't Han dead? oh no wait this is a sequel to the first film that doesn't ignore the second and third film but just takes place before them. So this is when Han was running with Toretto before he leaves for Japan...aaaah right. It feels pretty desperate for them to go way back and make a sequel to the first film after time has moved on with the second and third films. Did we really need to know what happened right after the first film? did we really need to see Han with Toretto? couldn't they just move ahead with a fourth that takes places after two and three? The whole structure of the franchise just seems so convoluted now.So Walker is now an agent in a suit for the FBI, so he looks even more like Keanu Reeves in 'Point Break', really helping his impression ten fold...totally bra! Toretto's girlfriend has been killed by a drug dealers henchman, the same drug dealer O'Conner is after, so both end up going after the same cartel. At the same time Toretto is still on the most wanted list which is still causing O'Conner morality issues, anyway to hell with all that! cue the pointless street racing!This film really does feel completely and utterly generic in every way. The plot just seems so pointless and uninspired, Letty is killed for pretty much unknown reasons (we don't find out why for ages), but I assume its mainly because Rodriguez wanted out of the franchise. From that point on its just watching Vin Diesel swagger from one set piece to another beating guys up or generally running away from the law.I mean really, the main bad guy drug kingpin organises a street race through downtown LA just to recruit a driver for his drug smuggling operation. The whole sequence is so pathetic, all the drivers line up like they were top guns of the chav world...bling city, one guy is black, one guy is white, one guy is Latino etc...PC much? Its not even a sensible race, more like a destruction derby and completely unrealistic. I realise this is not a serious action film but come on, lets at least make the racing sensible, it is the films main selling point. Oh...A hyper modded Skyline struggling to beat an US brick (American Muscle), really? I don't think so, import will always win. That Skyline should have been pushing 1000BHP, should have been if properly modded.The tanker hijack sequence at the start of the film is just as dumb as the exact same sequence in the first film. Once again I gotta ask...why not just stop the tanker, take the driver out at gun point and then calmly take the fuel?? surely that's easier? Oh no wait the director wants to have an exciting chase sequence with lots of fast cars and a big explosion at the end, oooooh gotcha.Then there is the quite plainly idiotic chase sequences through these underground tunnels across the US border into Mexico. I can't even begin to express how stupid this whole concept is let alone how awful it looks with terrible CGI. For starters who built these tunnels? how? when? how did the US border patrols not notice this massive undertaking??! How the hell does anyone know exactly where the entrance is to these tunnels when they are disguised as a rock face and you're travelling towards them at about 200+ MPH! The sequences within the tunnels are just dreadful, it looks like a video game. As the actors sit in the mock cars you can laugh at the hideous CGI rock formations whizzing past in the windows/rear windscreen. Again I know this isn't a serious flick but come on...this takes the p*ss. And we are to believe they are all zooming down these narrow badly lit mine shafts in super imports and US muscle cars at well over 150MPH?! really?What I love about this franchise/film is the fact Toretto always seems to have a modded muscle car. Doesn't matter where he is or what's happened, he turns up with a newly charged up car...always American muscle. I wish it was this easy in reality. Even at the very end, O'Conner and what's left of Toretto's crew pop up to bust him out...all driving more expensive heavily modded cars! Where do they get them from?? how many Dodge Chargers have they gone through now? how many do they own? do they clone them?? Do any of these guys have insurance? wait silly question.This film did well simply because the original cast came back, but I can't for the life of me understand how that helps. Yes I like Vin Diesel but the rest are terrible, the plot is formulaic and dull, the film is choppy and they have started to slide towards the action genre meaning actual street racing is out. But even the racing sequences are poor here, just ridiculous and show more resemblance to James Bond. Not to be taken seriously of course but this film has lost its originality and simply become a common action mess.4/10","3/10"
"Fast & Furious","Cinema2kMendoza","4 April 2022","This movie is one of my favorites, and starts with a heist in the middle of the mountains with dom and his family.then after the opening we discover letty is missing and brian is a cop again. So in many ways this movie takes place after the first and everybody returns and theres new people in the crew. For me the best scenes are
-the audition race, in the night, filmed in locations that look real and everything seems to be happen in a real city(never feels like a movie set)
-how dom here is a detective and he finds what happened to letty and why, just visiting the place
-the whole third act, when dom and brian are friends again and both try to catch the bad guy in the desert.not only the movie becomes a action movie with alot of nice scenes, you see both brian and dom working togheter, and obviusly now mia is back with brian, and dom have his charger ready to race and go.The music is great, the action feels real, and the drama is really good.Also theres jokes(like when they ask brian how many cars he wants and he say he wants them all)for car fans, dom is seen back in his garage working.he build two cars in the movie. Brian build one and get one free because dom.Wish this movie have better rating, is funny to watch and never dissapoints.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","anselmdaniel","26 September 2020","This review contains spoilers.Fast & Furious or Fast & Furious 4 is the fourth installment to The Fast & Furious franchise. The movie is a sequel to The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift but is more of a direct sequel to 2 Fast 2 Furious. The movie features Paul Walker and Vin Diesel as they reprise their roles of Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto respectively. The crew from the first movie confront a drug lord called Braga that wrongs both Dominic and Brian.The plot of this movie is incredibly incomprehensible. Many events in the plot simply happen without any reason or the flimsiest of reasoning. This movie's plot is an excuse to show car chases. The story keeps up the action at the expense of the plot. An example of this is in one car race, Brian is knocked out of the race. He is able to use his FBI connections to re-unite with Dominic Toretto by taking another person's place. The other characters and even the villain simply accept this and allow it to happen.The main story of Letty's murder is not well done. This story feels incredibly flimsy and the audience does not even see the murder happen. It is simply in a flashback scene that is told. I understand that the movie wanted to use this event as the reason for Dominic Toretto's mission but it felt incredibly forced.The finale of the movie improves the rest of the movie. With an explosive finale and the story being wrapped up, the movie concludes in a satisfying way. This movie did set up the rest of the series well and this can be considered this installment's strength. I did look forward to the other future installments because of this movie. The movie ends with the crew assembling and busting Dom out of a prison truck.I do not recommend Fast & Furious. This movie's plot is a jumbled mess. The only redeeming factor for this movie is its place for the rest of the series.Grade: D","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","pkzeewiz","16 April 2010","The first two of these were horrible, the third part was OK and now were back to sucking again.Justin Lin is back directing and he did pretty good on Tokyo Drift and he and writer Chris Morgan seemed to put life into this series, but here they basically took all that sucked and ruined the first two and put them into part four.The horrible cast returns, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster. I like Michele Rodriquez but sadly she wasn't here but a short period of time. They also featured Sung Kang from part 3, which proves this movie took place before part three, as Kangs character died in Tokyo Drift. The only new member I liked was Greg Cipes playing a small role.This time, Diesel goes back to L.A. after his girlfriend (Rodriquez) is killed he is on a mission to find out who did it. Meanwhile, Walker is now an F.B.I. agent and he's after the same guy for other reasons and he and Vin end up becoming (you guessed it...) drivers for this bad guy. and then blah blah a bunch of junk, seen it all before yadda yadda BORING.Lin might direct drifting well, but he sucked directing these races, it had no real hardcore action, focused way too much on character and was pretty much the same stuff you would expect. I wouldn't recommend it..part 3 is the only one worth watching 3/10","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","sn319","6 December 2014","Fast and Furious drops the ""the's"", as well as all the fun of the other films. No seriously, this film sucks. With a new director (Justin Lin) who will go on to direct the rest of the movies so far, I figured the direction would change to something perhaps a little more bearable. And while the movie feels more like an action film and focuses a lot more on police politics and revenge, it still can't find a balance between story, action, and racing.Dom's girlfriend Letty is murdered and Dom returns to California to get revenge. Brian O'Conner is trying to solve this case as well, leading him to a cartel he has to embed himself in, much like the second movie. But Dom's doing the exact same, leading to a confrontation between the estranged friends.I appreciate that the movie ties into all the other ones and manages to create really good continuity, but everything else sucks. The action has way too much CG to be appealing, even the driving sequences. You can see a focus on ridiculous stunts over high-octane racing. Partway through there is one good race, but everything else is so dependent on CG backgrounds that it doesn't work. The final scene especially could have benefited from some real stunt work.The story, what seems like it could be a good revenge plot, is instead another weakness. The bad guys are lame and two dimensional; the main characters are hardly developed beyond what they were in the first film. The action is so sparse and so lame it's hardly worth the price of admission. The adrenaline you'd expect just isn't there.Describing Fast and Furious as flat is an understatement. The movie is so flat it's driving on its rims. And that's sad because there was potential here.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","jace_the_film_guy","16 July 2021","After three Fast and the Furious films that were far from enjoyable, I was surprised by how much I was entertained by the fourth installment in the franchise. It was refreshing to see Dom and Brian back together again after years apart. The reunion did not seem forced and there were real moments of conflict between the two of them.The car sequences were fantastic as always and the acting greatly improved over the previous films. While the script was weak and the dialogue had ""I don't like sand"" moments, this is the first entry that I would gladly go back and re-watch.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","isaacochoterena","4 January 2022","This film finally brings us what we were waiting for so much, but it is much less credible than the first ones.In this film the tendency to use the conveniences to get out of the conflict begins, these conveniences end up being implausible and not very credible for the audience, although there is less than in the most recent films of the saga, but even so it does not stop being a resource cheap. The story ends up being boring since it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere or wanting to resolve a conflict, it's just chases or car races, which are even bad due to their horrible editing and mediocre special effects. They introduce new characters but there is no development of them, nor of what happened in the time that has elapsed to the already known characters.Every time the situations that the characters go through and the story to be told are less credible, even the cars go into the background to tell a boring and tedious story.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","FilmMan47","26 May 2016","this 4th installment in the series is quite underrated i have to say i have seen all of the fast furious films when i first saw this i hated it & thought it was boring because it is slow paced unlike other films but when i saw it the second time my opinion changed & i enjoyed it for what it was this one has a better story just like the first one,this film gave birth to the prequel series of fast & furious the story of the film happens around or after 2 fast & 2 furious.i just have a question how the hell did Jordana Brewster looked so cute here plus the hairstyle was great.one of the biggest things about this is the return of Vin diesel a lot of people though the series are over but Vin diesel just made a huge comeback in film industry with this one the action is nice here but the film itself is very dark & sad at times.for those who don't know Letty goes missing in this film & everyone thinks she is dead what happens is that Letty was working for Brian & Fbi secretly then she joins Braga & his gang but when the gang finds out there is a mole inside they get rid of her she escapes in a car but in the accident looses her memory in some hospital the international gang of Owen Shaw grabs her then she works with them it can be seen in fast n furious 6 later on Dom rescues Letty & defeating Ownen Shaw these events leads up to the emerging of super villain Dekard Shaw(Jason Statham) in furious seven 2015 story:plot is very simple here Brian joins Fbi & Dom returns in the big city together these 2 bring down a notorious drug runner Braga.Dom is hunted by the law here in the end when he gets arrested & being sent to jail Mia & Brian help him escape is one of the best scenes ever filmed in the series,fast five 2011 was nice but this one is betterthe opening oil tanker robbing scene is fantastic its like a bond film even better & more epic Vin Diesel is a insane man if he actually drove that fast on those mountain roads that's all i have to say.my view of this film is you don,t have to look deeper into this film to understand it it is just like a usual film only with a tight bonded narrative that blends easily with action.Overall Fast & Furious 2009 is a well made film so just grab a copy and enjoy it my rating is 7/10.Recommended","6/10"

"Fast & Furious","EijnarAmadeus","13 February 2011","The fourth installment of the franchise gets Vin Diesel, Scott Walker, Michelle Rodriguez (for ten minutes) and Jordana Brewster together and aims to satisfy the slowly fading fans' tastes - disappointingly, it's probably the worst volume yet. First of all, it's not fast - at all, the car chases are confusing, badly shot, few and worst of all, all too animated with CGI, and the plot moves nothing like those supposed cars. Second, it's not furious, Vin Diesel thinks he is, occasionally, but only when he bothers, and the rest looks stupidly blunt and careless. Where's the fierce, fire and flame? Not to be seen miles away. I had to spool through that terrible climax where the plot has taken us up to switching points of cars chasing each other either in the dead desert, or in a dark, tight tunnel - both without any sense of speed. Quite terrible as we find a popped hood empty.","5/10"

"Fast & Furious","mvpdom","19 June 2020","The 4th installment of the Fast & Furious franchise called Fast & and Furious not to be confused with The Fast and the Furious. Which one of the many dumb things about this movie including it takes place before the previous movie, that Brian O'Connor manages to return to being a cop, and the Brian never gives any reason for choosing a life of crime over one in law enforcement but that he respects Dominic more than himself. Before anything else this movie is a dumb entertaining action movie, but there is remnant of a good story, just remnants.
The main characters Brain O'Connor and Dominic Toretto start the movie at odds, but ultimately are buddies and are working toward the same goal, the apprehension of the drug dealer. At its core this movie has a base of a good movie, the apprehension of a drug dealer, Brain's struggle with being the good guy, and Dominic's desire for revenge. The chase for the drug dealer is a good action plot with a twist of who Braga is from my perspective I don't think obvious, and lead to an awesome car chase at the end. This the template for all the action and exciting sequences that you can't complain about.
Brain O'Connor is somehow allowed back in the FBI and allowed to work around Dominic Toretto even though he let him go. The whole movie he is working toward the goal of capturing the Braga, who is essentialy the mission, but his desire to help Dominic and Mia greater than any other desire. His motives for these actions don't make any sense, if he really cared about Dom and Mia he would help them have a change of heart. These movies basicly preach that if crime is where your family than crime is OK.
Dominic Toretto, a revenge story is pretty standard for any movie, but in this movie there isn't any push back to stop the revenge it also glorifies revenge.
Brian and Dominic are very morally gray and they see their actions as good and even pray that God bless their day where they steal $60 million dollars of heroin and hide it.
Also Mia is pushing back from Brain for the first half of the movie and all of the sudden they start making out.
Though all of this is wrapped around to be positive because I is so easy to pick a part and adds to the already entertaining factor of the movie.
The movie includes many awesome car chases, a chase on foot with Paul Walker, explostions, and Vin Diesel rams into the guy who killed his girlfriend with a car. The movie is entertaining, dumb, and stupid.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","nicholls905-280-546911","24 April 2020","This film starts pulling together all the parts of the series that worked. The spin-offs had been somewhat successful but they lacked the core strength of Diesel and Walker being together. Walker has grown into his role over time and the improved dialogue allows for less cringe worthy exchanges. The plot is still generic and is only a slight improvement over number 2. Disappointing plot undermines what should've of a slam dunk. The revenge plot is new for the series and from this moment on the storylines grow even more insane.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","babu_145","3 April 2009","Before i write anything about the movie the reason they make sequels is for money especially this one since they brought back the original cast. If you like the fast and the furious saga then definitely this is a must see, they brought back the two hottest stars of the saga for the sequel. The plot like usual isn't what captures the viewers attention, its always the cars and hot girls. They reunited Vin Diesel and Paul Walker which is great but we don't want to see the same cars again. Nissan Skyline is a great tuner vehicle but we've seen it before same goes for the American muscle. This one has similarities like the first movie of the series which is the drama scenes which were a lot more than the action sequences. The action sequences done in the car were eye catching but the chase done on feet was unrealistic and brutal, even the first action scene where Diesel drives under the gasoline truck was plain ""stupid"". The first one was about the tuned up cars and the storybetween Paul walker and Vin diesel, 2nd one was about crime and alittle action, third one was fully about drifting, and now they reunited the hottest stars of the saga to recreate the magic of the trilogy. It has everything except the ""magic"",it relvoves around the death of Michelle Rodriguez which is already a downfall since she is proabaly the best girl for the job. The critics have bashed this movie, some critics say it's 8thgrader vocabulary used in the script, but lets be straight forward we don't watch movies like this for stories or the never ending drama, if we wanted watch movies like that we'll only watch Oscar nominated movies. Action flicks like these are enjoyed by viewers, scenes that capture your attention and blow you away, making the impossible stunts possible. From what i heard there is a 5th installment which is good news for people who love cars from American muscle to tuned up skyline's. I am excited about the 5th version only if Micheal bay could direct the movie it will certainly have extraordinary chase sequences.If you liked the first three then it's worth a look, don't get overly manipulated by the critics and watch it for entertainment value and don't expect the story to be creative. I wouldn't rate this movie out of 10 but it deserves a 6 just for the fact many scenes could have been improved maybe they cut back on the budget but it's worth viewing it at the big screen.","4/10"

The fact that he is an unrepentant pirate is ignored as we are supposed to feel sorry for his incarceration at the end. But of all the scenes, the one where the crime boss tries to kill the successful drives who deliver the drugs. Why would they do that. Its an echo of a similarly ridiculous scene from the Dark Knight but this guy doesn't wear a scared smile. How did Hollywood get so out of touch with criminal behaviour.Anyway, check your brain at the door cause this one is remarkably senseless, and pointless and idiotic etc..Its not all bad. The action is pretty cool at times, though you can tell the stunts are fake.","3/10"
"Fast & Furious","policy134","12 July 2015","You have to give Paul Walker and Vin Diesel credit. They are what make these movies a little less painful to sit through.I made a silly promise to myself that I would watch the entire box of the first six movies and I am a little less sorry now, than after I watched the first film.Although, as I stated before, the series is not high art by any means, but you really have to admire the craft that went into it.The tone of the movie is very serious compared to the others, excluding the first race which is more of the same silliness that you seen from the other movies. The plot revolves around the one man against a much more powerful opponent (like most Clint Eastwood movies or also many westerns). Diesel plays it for all it's worth, but the story around the revenge plot is unfortunately a very dull experience.We are introduced to many stereotypes throughout and references to the earlier films. I just lost interest in this commentary. What is there more to say.Watch this and judge it for yourself. I thought it was a terribly dull experience, although the lead actors do a very nice job, sans one or two perhaps.","3/10"
"Fast & Furious","LazySod","6 May 2009","The fourth film in the series. Placed, in time, somewhere between the first and the third. I am not completely sure whether this film plays before the second film, or after the second film - both scenarios would work out. Anyway, being the fourth film in the series there is little left to be explained and so the action starts rolling right from the very first seconds of the film and it doesn't run flat until a long while later. The story line is more or less the same as the first film and the roles being played out are much the same too.In fact, that is where this film fails to work out all that well - it is too much of a copy of the original one and although its subtitle is ""original parts"" that really does not make it worth the cinema time - the first film is not so old that there is a whole generation of people between that one and this one. It is not a bad film and for the fans of the series this is a worthy watch but I would have hoped they had done some more work on the story line and a little on the fast pace action - it would have made for a better and more attractive film.5 out of 10 high speed chases","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","Rickting","15 March 2015","I saw Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6 before the earlier instalments, and the earlier instalments of this high octane franchise are noticeably weaker. This one sees the return of a stubbornly blank Vin Diesel, who is trying to find the one responsible for the death of his girlfriend. Paul Walker is now an agent again, and the two work together to try and stop a drug trafficker. As I love action films, this was moderately enjoyable for me but Fast & Furious is undeniably the worst of the films that I've seen. The film opens up with an entertaining heist sequence which works despite an overabundance of lame CGI, before deteriorating into an overly serious turbo fuelled drive through as many action clichés as possible. It's a well made movie, and the introduction of a murder mystery is interesting, but when it's Vin Diesel who barely changes his expression throughout and who really cannot do anything other than be tough, it just doesn't work. The film fails to reconcile a more serious plot with its cheesy action movie origins.The action is enjoyable, but there's plenty of downtime which just becomes dull. The emphasis on car culture and racing is very tedious and there's not enough proper action. Fans of the franchise and action lovers (like me) will be entertained, but casual audiences will just not have as much fun. When it comes to female characters, occasionally the film makes you think of Michael Bay, while during a race sequence the endangering of numerous innocent bystanders is pretty awkward. The acting is barely passable. Vin Diesel is just too one note to be interesting. Paul Walker is a little better. It has a good finale, but throughout there's just not enough fun. With Justin Lin behind the camera, it's well directed although the camera gets a bit shaky at times. A watchable film overall. I can't give it a higher rating because it just isn't very good, but it nobly tries to go in a slightly different direction and offers some decent action, although one rather good action scene was spoilt by the trailer.4/10","8/10"

"Fast & Furious","claszdsburrogato","9 January 2024","Perhaps this will be the turning point of the Fast and Furious franchise. This is where we see the change from a plot that involves street racing to something much bigger, but we are still not presented with more intense action. This is the big problem with the fourth film in the franchise. He cannot maintain the simplicity of the previous ones, but he does not risk the megalomania of the later ones. The film focuses on a drama that cannot carry. Everything that tries to be dramatic in the narrative becomes clumsy. The direction doesn't handle the drama well, the actors don't have the capacity to do it and the entire atmosphere that tries to have a more dramatic and serious aura becomes just cheesy. The film is saved by a few good action scenes that make the experience not a complete disaster, however, there isn't much to save in the film.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","alekspredator87","28 April 2023","The movie ""Fast and Furious 4"" is a classic representative of the genre of action and movies about cool cars, which fully justifies all the expectations of fans. The original cast returns to the series, viewers will be able to see their favorite characters again, played by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster.The plot of the film departs a little from the original source, where we enjoyed the world of night street racing. Now the emphasis is on the criminal component, where the stakes are repeatedly raised, and the heroes will have to learn to live in a new way and go to meet dangerous opponents.The action in the film keeps the viewer's attention from start to finish, and hardcore racing in underground tunnels is simply breathtaking. The creators have put a lot of effort into creating special effects that look very spectacular and convincing.Paul Walker and Vin Diesel once again prove their acting talent and professionalism by playing their roles at the highest level. They create convincing images that will not leave any viewer indifferent. Their interaction and the dynamics of their relationship create a real chemistry on the screen, and this makes the film even more fascinating and interesting. We will see the confrontation and tension between the heroes, because the current situation allows only one of them to succeed, despite the fact that each of the heroes has their own motivation and there is no way to step back in their aspirations.Unfortunately, the main villain of the film was not impressed. His predecessor looked much more convincing in the second part of the gasoline saga. The antagonist's assistant, with whom the hero of Diesel Dominic Toretto has his own scores, looks much more convincing. It is this confrontation that is of particular interest. But the main thing in the film is wild racing and high stakes, where every mistake behind the wheel and outside it can be decisive for the characters.The acting of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster is undoubtedly one of the main advantages of the film. They managed to create that inexplicable charm, thanks to which the viewer simply falls in love with the characters. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are an integral part of the franchise, and their tandem has long been one of the main symbols of the cult saga.One of the main advantages of ""Fast and Furious 4"" is its visual performance. The film was shot very beautifully and qualitatively, with beautiful landscapes and incredible tricks that amaze the imagination. The color palette is ready to please the viewer. At some point we will see bright chases in broad daylight, and in another case we will enjoy the dark dungeons through which the characters of the picture will drive. Director Justin Lin coped with his work at the highest level, creating a fascinating and exciting atmosphere that does not allow the viewer to relax for a minute. He has already staged a good ""Tokyo Drift"", and the man has several more pictures about ""Fast and Furious"" ahead of him. And each subsequent film will be much more amazing than the previous one.In general, ""Fast and Furious 4"" is a great movie that is definitely worth watching for all fans of the genre. It contains all the necessary elements to become a real hit: an excellent plot, spectacular stunts, good acting and beautiful visualization. This is really one of the best films in the series, which will not leave anyone indifferent.9 out of 10.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","limelybean","4 April 2009","While this second movie of Vin Diesel's ""Fast and Furious"" Trilogy did not impress me as much as its predecessor, ""The Fast and The Furious"" did, it was definitely worth my money and time, I thoroughly enjoyed every speeding second!The film will meet your expectations of a good plot, witty humor, fast cars, sexy people and down-to-earth fun, and might even have you gripping your seat in a few of the fast-paced driving scenes. While this second movie does not have as many awesome cars as the first film, ""The Fast and the Furious"" did, it still keeps you wanting more of the unbelievable yet awesomely choreographed driving and action sequences it boasts throughout the entire movie.Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew are back in action once again, ready to kick butt and take names in the second of what will be three great, fun-filled movies, so if you enjoyed the first film, I definitely recommend you see this one!","4/10"

"Fast & Furious","willcundallreview","18 September 2015","Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are back, and they are having to work together even though they kind of don't really like each other still. The movie basically is all about the bad guys and the good guys being Walker and Diesel where both of them have the old shared enemy thing going on and have to help each other to achieve their goal. The plot kind of plays out like a crime thriller but with lots of cars, in fact I even felt at times like the cars were not as important in this one as before, they don't talk about them as if they are humans like they have before. The reasons I think this movie is poor I will go into but first I must say if you haven't seen the one's before this then go and watch them or this will make no sense.Let's start with the actors and the star attractions to the show, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return in the style they left us with last. The duo have a strange problem in which I felt was actually the director and writers fault, giving them lines that make them look really dumb and obvious although neither actor does that well in this. The film has a lot of poor acting throughout and though it definitely isn't really dislikeable, still just far from good enough in this already high grossing franchise. The thing is I didn't hate this movie far from it in fact it isn't actually bad, but for me it is too close to being bad for it to even break average, the whole story is pretty basic but the people behind the scenes are the one's who make it a let down.Justin Lin is the man in the directors chair and for me he is again poor, the vision he sets out is just too like I said before, obvious, and he turns some moments which could have been good into over the top action and acting. Chris Morgan writes again and the collaborating between Lin and Morgan just is not going well, the dialogue is messy and like I said the whole plot is set out in such a generic and basic way. This movie will try to draw you in with all its action and big chases and races but all of it is false things to make you excited and I refused to be won over by disappointing work behind the scenes. Now the fourth instalment is probably somewhere so far into the series around third in my rankings, just about better than Tokyo Drift but below the first two. If you're interested in the series and have maybe already really connected with certain characters then maybe you will enjoy this more than I did and although I didn't really not enjoy it, I just felt it too much of a mess to be a film I could look back on with positivity. What Justin Lin tries to create is a movie that is fast but sombre and contains a whole lot of one-liners to try and impress, some come off well but the majority do not and overall I didn't feel pleased enough by the lines.So The Fast and Furious marches on and although this does it fast and furious, they forgot to make it actually good. One weird thing I felt about this was that actors like Walker and Vin Diesel are getting better as their respective characters and for the first time in the series since the first maybe, I could feel a little connection with them if only in select points. Finally I would recommend this to of course fan's of the series but also those who like big stunts and a bit of action + fast cars too, it feels a bit like a movie that someone attached NOS too and then flung into a cinema screen full pelt.","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","EthanBJones_03","14 May 2017","Directed by Justin LinStarring Paul Walker, Vin Disel and John Ortiz​ Plot Overview: When a crime brings them back to the mean streets of Los Angeles, fugitive ex-convict Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) reignite their high-octane feud. However, when a common enemy rears his head, Dom and Brian must learn how to work together and trust one another in order to defeat him.If you still enjoy this franchise, and truly care about these character: don't watch this movie. It is by far the worst film in the franchise and contains so little enjoyment and substance that I honestly think it's unbelievably lucky that 'Fast Five' was made. I honestly can't stand this film. None of the actors are good, some are remotely passable but that is still being very generous. The 'action' and 'set pieces' are so awful that I honestly believe the Drift Race in 'Tokyo Drift' was more exciting that this. It's one of the most boring, dullest movies I've seen in a long time and contains no genuine enjoyment to warrant a recommendation. If you need any more reasons to avoid this atrocity, then I will go more in depth.Saying Vin Disel is a 'bad actor' was pretty generous for this movie. You could tell me he's a robot and I would completely believe you because he's one of the most dull, bland, barren, boring, emotionless, robotic actors that still work today. He can't emit any emotions other than HAPPY, ANGRY and MUMBLE-y. It amazes me he still gets work because I don't see what the appeal of him as an actor. Paul Walker was, to be fair, passable as Brian O'Connor but even then he was extremely basic and didn't do much to impress. John Ortiz was very weak as the Brauga. The villain in the movie was also incredibly weak.There is no real story that runs through this movie and any glimmer of hope that one might exist is locked in Torreto's car and put in front a train. The ending was pretty cool and looked very neat.Technically, this movie is immensely flawed. The cinematography was absolutely dreadful and the lighting was genuinely depressing. The editing was awful and it's some of the worst cinematography I've seen in a pretty long time. The effects were pretty nice but they weren't exactly a primary focus and didn't affect the quality of the movie.The main thing this movie needed to do was provide really good and enjoyable action/set pieces. This movie completely failed to do that. As stated before, I would rather watch Lucas Black face of against the 'Drift King' and would rather watch Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson drive out of a garage with 10,000 cars again than sit through the truly, truly awful action sequences in this movie.This movie tried to replace the 'fun moments' with 'dramatic moments' which I would normally be fine with but it was done so incredibly poorly. It wasn't needed for this type of film and just felt so forced and tacked on.In conclusion, there is a reason people don't refer to this movie when talking about the 'Fast and Furious' franchise. I can't say anyone should watch this movie because it just isn't worth the watch.3/10Wouldn't Recommend","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","jammyn","9 April 2009","Well, where to begin.... As it might have occurred to you that after seeing a movie you head straight to the toilet in the theatre where people are gathering and waiting in lines, exchanging thoughts about the movie. Actually this time the line was quite long and everybody kept saying the same things. Why do studios always have to make a bad sequel to a great movie (FNF 1)? They wanted to get paid again and again and again? Well, this time the story is over because nobody will want to see the next sequel. I always say to my friends that i can write a better script than this while i am in the bathroom for 5 minutes, and yes, with a cast like this the story should have been MUCH MORE enjoyable, action packed, where the director does not let you breathe (like in the first FNF). Come on, this movie is about cars, the director did not have the first idea about new models (okay, there was one), but that's not even the point. The story should have been! And the characters should have been! Emotions should have been! The movie is all about grief from the beginning, which does not pay well in my opinion. The audience left the theatre without the adrenalin they have paid for, unsatisfied. And in this dangerous financial times it is a huge mistake! The movie has grossed a lot, okay. Because people want to see it with their own eyes that the movie which was great once, went down the gutter, otherwise they won't believe it. Go ahead and watch it, just for the sake of disappointment. If anyone is sorry, I am, believe me.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","SophomoreSlump","10 April 2009","Fast & Furious, the fourth in line of the Fast and the Furious franchise, uses the same old formula that makes the first three movies good and then trimmed off the little things that make them bad.The story kicks off with the return of some familiar faces, namely, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his band of brothers – and girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) – in an attempt to steal some petrol, in which they succeed. But Dom is a wanted man. And being an honorable wanted man that he is, he left his friends in hope that the cops would come for him instead of them. Skip a few years later, Dom gets a call from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) telling him that his beloved girlfriend is murdered. And that is generally the plot of this movie: Dom's out to find the person responsible for Letty's death.And then in come another familiar face, the undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), in a very fast and adrenaline-rushed chase scene. That is, on foot and from rooftop to rooftop. That is one of the most exciting scenes in the movie.Brian is on a hunt for a drug-dealer, who is actually the same guy that Dom is trying to find. So they teamed up... just like old times.Fast & Furious is really for fans only. New-comers might not understand the connection between the characters, but the story itself is quite easy to follow, with some surprising twist in the plot.But it was a disappointment to see that some of the action sequences are done in CGI, namely the tunnel scenes. This really takes away the excitement that the first three movies offer. And also, this movie is way too serious. Instead of the cars and races, we're focused on Dom's quest for revenge which could be a drag after a while.If you just let go of the bad dialogues and some plot holes, and probably the lack of action, Fast & Furious is actually not bad. It's still fast and still furious, and with a more matured storyline.But if they're planning for a sequel, I suggest that they get back to the original theme of the franchise, which is racing and cars.","6/10"

"Fast & Furious","nickmesafilms","1 January 2012","The fourth installment of the hit race car series is set after the events of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"", and it's rather to be seen as a third movie. Yes, I'm glad this movie is able to bring back Walker and Diesel on the screen, and the action is still entertaining. But the movie follows the loss of heart, story, characters, and sadly, a little bit of the action. Rarely will people ever still care about what happens to these street-racing maniacs, through their adventures with the law. There's hardly any plot in this movie, and I think nobody can really pay attention, because there isn't one. It's like some random car sale auction has just landed on the big screen, only they end up racing with them. But the movie still follows the same formula as a summer movie, with tons of race cars and hot ladies. This movie has it's bad-ass moments, and it's sometimes touching. But the movie experiences slow action scenes, and they make this movie non-exciting. To make this review quick as possible, ""Fast and Furious"" has the basics of an ""OK"" movie. It doesn't contain any surprises, or any idea about how to make a more better movie in the series, but they still make it look good anyways. ""Fast and Furious"", in my review, ""bad-ass throughout, but totally bland"".","3/10"
"Fast & Furious","stelian_blidar","14 August 2009","When i first heard that the all of the actors from first movie will appear and of course Vin Diesel as well, i had high hopes for this one. I mean after Tokyo Drift (which i did like a lot, in spite of the story,thanks to the vision of Justin Lin about the franchise should be) it could only mean good things for the fourth part.Right? I got in the cinema really hyped about the movie after seeing the trailer and of course for Justin Lin directing it and not to even mention all the good actors - Vin,Rodriguez,Walker. Vin Diesel is a must have in the Fast &Furious franchise, without him is just like seeing Harry Potter movie without Daniel Radcliffe. All actors performed well in the movie especially Vin who has a very cool-hero bad ass type. Brewster played the role of the younger sister as it should,Rodriguez represented his role a bit different from the first and the last but not least Walker, who has his role like a glove, he does even look like a cop what the hell. Justin directed very well, with lots of effects, cool racing scenes, brings out the most he can from actors, what i didn't like was that they're wasn't so much exotic cars or imports,i really wanted more cars and more racing scenes,don't get me wrong there is some really good racing scenes,but i wanted more .... but in the end is a really good and entertaining movie even for those who hadn't seen all 3 FnF.I would really like if they make a fifth in the franchise especially that things will only go only interesting, you will understand why i say this after you've seen the whole movie.I recommend this movie!

The only reason that I didn't give it a 1/10 is because I watched it with my friends, that means we laughed really hard on stupid scenes, so we kind of enjoyed it. But as a movie it had NOTHING, it was empty, I don't even recall the story! The fighting was boring, the action was CHEESY, the cars weren't that interesting (watch Death Race and you'll know how movies about cars should be) and mostly Vin Diesel was horrible! He is a bad actor, I feel bad for dissing him but he is, and what is up with those muscles? Very distracting - and NO not in a good way.Okay so maybe I enjoyed the movie once or twice during it but that's about it. It is obvious that the target audience is men who want to see some cars flying around and a lot of hot chicks. Okay I GET IT the movie has to have some hot girls but what is UP with the asses? Most of the film was people shouting in Spanish and scenes of girl's asses. How stupider it can be? I have no idea! I know this movie might not be directed to me a 18 year old girl, but I enjoy such movies (yes I don't mind the ""hot chicks"" and ""cars"") I'm into movies with car action! But this movie was just silly.Don't waste your time on it, if you are interested in a COOL FUN movie - WITH HOT CHICKS & CARS - obviously what guys are looking for .. watch Death Race, you WILL enjoy it SO much better! 4/10","7/10"

It's still fun seeing this group together, but the story is even less intriguing in parts than the others. The villain has no background other than just a really good drug trafficker and the movie is otherwise used to bring Dom back into the fold. The last chase scene also leaves much to be desired. You often can't tell who is in which car chasing who for about ten minutes. Finally at the end you get the showdown you knew was coming with a very predictable result.Overall it's fine as part of the series but it definitely won't stand out as one of the better ones.","6/10"

"Fast & Furious","kaden_lewis","4 July 2021","This is the best movie of the series so far. It changed the theme from street racing to drug smuggling/revenge. Firstly, I was happy to see the original crew back for the first time since the first movie. It is too bad we had to lose Letty in the first half hour. It ended up working out though because it set up a plot that I thought was good for a Fast and Furious movie. Brian, back working for the FBI, and Dom who is looking to get revenge on Letty's killer both infiltrate a drug smuggler's driving crew. Time passes, the movie gets good, there was a shocking reveal, and some good action. The movie ended with Dom and Brian capturing Braga and trying to get him back to the USA from Mexico to go to prison. There was a daring drive through smuggling tunnels in the border, and Braga eventually getting arrested. The very end of the film had Dom being transferred to a max security prison with Brian, Mia, and Dom's bickering Dominican pals about to break him out of the bus, setting up Fast 5.This was a great movie and I definitely recommend this to everyone. It is very entertaining, but surely they could have named it something else 😂. The name is almost identical to the first movie's title, The Fast and the Furious.","6/10"

The story is not the most interesting and with unexplained circumstances, it begins to lose the realistic feel of the previous installments. The twists feel very predictable and there are quite a few points where the story begins to get boring. Redeeming that as best as possible, the cast all do a charming job, as you can tell that they have fun and enjoy working together.

If you compare all releases on Fast and Furious, the 1st Installation still rocks! Then after that comes FF4, then Tokyo Drift and the least exciting was the second part.Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) crazily kept on changing his mind which route to take while driving. He did this all the time in the movie. If he reached a dead-end, he quickly routed his car to a new path. Amazing ! The only thing which I think had potential was when they come to rescue Vin Diesel in the end. The writers could have kept it for the next installation along with a fast-on-feet, jailbreak chase sequence.Very few street races, Amazing Direction, very few scenes for Michelle (Laticia/Letty). I feel a bit cheated because I expected to watch Jordana Brewster (Mia) who had not many scenes in the movie.Definitely a good watch !","2/10"

But as they are forced to confront a shared enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And the two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the wheel. The opening sequence of the film was amazing it was like a heist where they were getting on a cargo to steal some( well to be honest I don't what they were trying to get) but right when they complete that mission soon someone dies and that causes a great dispute for Don Tretto. The performances from the cast like Vin Disel, he isn't great but he isn't bad he's just good. Michelle Rodriguez is the weakest of the cast and was barely in the movie so I guess that was good and Paul Walker was good. But everyone else was terrible. The direction from Justin Lin was better this time around I felt like with Tokyo Drift he was more up for shining flashy cars at you in bad ass racing. Fast & Furious is a step up in the series it's got some good acting, great action sequences but falls short with some bad acting and an uninteresting plot that falls flat. Fast & Furious gets a two and a half out of five.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","thesterlingweaver","31 December 2021","Tokyo drift was a bad movie and a terrible sequel, but then, fast & furious was made and I was surprised, it's actually really great, the street racing sequences are eye candy to me, the climax and emotion is really good, it's just fun, I love the cliffhanger ending. Go check it out and skip Tokyo drift. You would be wasting your time watching that.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","utahman1971","7 November 2009","I did enjoy this movie a lot. For those people saying how bad ""Paul Walker"" was in last two movies, must of not seen ""Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift"" at all, because there was no ""Paul Walker"" or any from the original cast. So get off that drug your on and re-watch the 3rd movie again.This movie has met my expectations, and would be better if there were more street racing than tracking down a drug lord. I like testosterone movies like this. There is not too many action movies to watch anymore. I got this on DVD, and it is great. I would watch this over again, and also the first one. The second and third movies were not that good, but if you going to say something about those two movies, you better get your facts straight.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","Hellrazr360","4 April 2009","It goes without saying that the Fast and Furious franchise hasn't had a good run with the critics. Yet the films have had a mostly fair run at the box office, so they've gradually been released. The first entry is almost unanimously regarded as the best in the series while the second and third are typically frowned upon. For my two cents, the first and third are about equal while the second is best kept as a distant, forgettable memory. Given that this film is coming from Justin Lin, who directed Tokyo Drift, the least that should be expected are some well shot action scenes involving cars. Though enthusiasts of the series will also be looking for satisfaction to the story as well.Does it succeed? Yes, in most ways.The film opens with a bang as Dom, Han (from Tokyo Drift) and a couple other unknowns to the series attempt to steal some gas tank trailers off of a truck which, needless to say, doesn't go without a hitch. After this and a quickly filled in plot piece, we find out that Letty gets murdered and Dom naturally seeks revenge and returns to the U.S. With this and a current assignment, Brian O'Connor (from the first two films) is brought into the mix as he attempts to go after the same people Dom hunts down. The premise is decent enough with skepticisms and indecisiveness playing a large role between the characters.Speaking of the characters, one area of concern fans of the series might have is how well they're still executed and fleshed out after nearly ten year absence from each other (in regards to the film's release dates). Fortunately, the main cast mostly pulled off fair enough performances to stay convincing enough, though it isn't without some melodrama here and there. Fortunately, these moments aren't too frequent and don't hinder the film all that much. Diesel manages to pull of the usual 'just decent' performance that he's had in practically all of his films. Walker actually feels like the most fleshed out character and comes off as a better performer than Vin. As for the supporting cast, they're all just fair at best, with only one or two performances any better than that.But since this film is called ""Fast and Furious"" and is part of that very franchise, what most people will likely expect going in is for it to be, well, fast and furious. In this sense, the film does succeed quite well. Credit definitely has to be given to Lin for the action scenes involving the cars. The action in these parts are frantic and very exciting, with plenty of awesome, speeding cars to add adrenaline to these scenes. If there's anything you'll want to do at the end of the film, it'll be to get in your car and start shattering the speed limits.What Fast and Furious does best is give you an adrenaline rush during its action scenes. The film lives up to its name and will give those wanting some great car action sequences something to enjoy. When action isn't the focus of the film, it's far easier to find issues and be a bit turned off. But if you're a series fan you should be able to enjoy most of what the film offers and will likely walk away quite satisfied as I did. The first and third films are still my favorites in the series, but this installment is about as good as the first film and is miles above the laughable 2 Fast 2 Furious.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","mitchell5954","17 August 2019","Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the early Fast films. I could enjoy Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.I find the characters to be better this time around. Vin Diesel's character, Toretto, is back with a vengeance. Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones. I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.I like Paul Walker's character, Brian, more here than any of the previous films. He seems more mature and professional here. In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent. I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie.Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest. I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do. The other characters are not much.The villain is also very lazy. The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak. The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favorite villains of these movies.The races are still fun to watch. The races here are probably some of my favorite of the franchise. Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out. There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable. The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favorite Fast film so far. I definitely like it more than the films before it. I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc. The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI. For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","roadbuster-1","4 April 2009","No doubt they will be making a 5th as these movies are cheap enough to make and still moderately successful with the built in fan base. I say with the built in fan base because, with the lack believability of the 3rd one and the 4th one, no one but the rice boys would want to see a 5th one!!! I could write a better script and be a better director than Lin ever thought of being (remember interview where he said he was not a car guy)!!! The 3rd one was just stupid as it was so unrealistic and had no real character development; it just seemed to be a stereotypically western view of Japan. Yakuza and drifting, sure FF4 is just too slow at the start, feeling more like a bad episode of ""Cops"" or something. It was just kind of boring, and it was not like there was any real character development. And, as usual (except for the FF2 to a degree; i.e. FF2 was kind of like Miami Vice), there was no real believable plot; using a secret tunnel and street racers to smuggle drugs, sure, whatever... The races in the movie were just far to scattered, like they wanted to make this a movie about everything except the cars, heck they only showed an R35 once that I could tell (the red car on the screen when Brain is selecting his car) and used the R34 a few times. It felt like it just went on-and-on with its bad take on a cop drama. I was ready to leave before the ending credits, sad... It really felt like they wanted to have some type of one dimensional character development, like they wanted to make a serious work, but it fails at that. It also tries to tie up the ""loose ends"" as they stated they would do, but again, I don't think they should have tried. And Brain back with the FBI, what was with that? I thought that at the end of the 2nd one he was going to open up a tuning garage, what happened? Heck, that could have been more interesting; Brain gets involved with something that has to do with his new tuning shop and some kind of, well heck, organized crime (yes, that does seem to be the only answer the script writers have with this series of movies as a plot engine)! And of course, the end of FF4 works perfectly into the soon-to-be 5th installment! I see it; now Dominic and Brain must flee the USA to Europe and get involved in stopping the smuggling of, you know it, drugs! Oh, and Universal, if you want someone who can really make a real car movie, see me","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","athena24","14 May 2011","A major step up from ""Tokyo Drift"". Nice plot, Brian, Dominic and Mia are back and a worthy opponent make this movie fun to watch. Vin Diesel as Dominic is a perfect match. His presence alone boosts this series up. Paul Walker is just as good.The weak spot of the movie is the CGI action. Too much CGI. The truck explosion in the start to the car chases in the tunnel only ruin this movie. In the latter case, we both don't see much what's happening and it feels less believable and real.I liked the first two more than this sequel, though it's quite entertaining and worth watching ( for the fans of the series ). With the comeback of Brian and Dominic it shows a promise towards the next one.","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","snarkiness","12 April 2009","First of all, not my kind of movie but I can enjoy good action flicks enough to go see them- even if I'd rather be laughing or bawling my eyes out. I wasn't an avid fan of the franchise but I kept on hearing really good reviews so I thought I'd go see it. Little did I know that half the movie would be touching on stuff that happened in the previous films under the assumption that I knew who these people were. A little back story and a quick wrap up would have been nice, I was expecting to be able to jump in and enjoy the ride. I REALLY should have re-watched the other movies because than maybe I wouldn't have been so bored watching these people go through the motions. I wanted action, not REALLY terrible dialog between characters I'm unattached to. I mean, walking out I didn't even know their names and I was acutely aware of how uncomfortable a cinema chair was. The writing was so bad I looked over to my brother a dozen times just shaking my head.The car scenes were not redeeming either. There was a single race scene I enjoyed, the rest I couldn't have cared less.Overall, unless you are in love with all the characters you really can't enjoy this film.","7/10"

"Fast & Furious","gothicraige","4 April 2009","This is a great movie. Vin and Paul come back, Michelle and Jordana are still there it was great to pick up where everyone else left off at. Sure that in the time since Brian (Walker) had found out that its been Dom (Diesel) ripping off the trucks that he had gone off to Miami to bring in drug lord and recover missing money. Then the whole series takes off to Tokyo where it had nothing to do with the original cast or the original plot. Dom is kicking it down in the Dominican Republic with Letty (Rodriguez) pulling the same stuff they did in L.A. Dom leaves to save Letty but she ends up getting murdered by the new gang in town headed by a Columbian drug Cartel. The Charger/Challenger (not sure which one Dom has) makes it comeback only to get destroyed once more. Other than the typical Brian working for the government to bring in the bad guy and having a love affair with Mia (Brewster) in the process while still trying to save Dom...this movie was great. Fast cars, hard hits, hot women....this one returns to the true F&F fashion of feeding the need for speed.","10/10"
"Fast & Furious","joshuadrake-91275","23 September 2015","After The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, a sequel with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster returning was put into production and would not be released until April of 2009.The story sees Dom and his new crew hijacking fuel tankers in the Dominican Republic, but he believes that the police is high on their trail. Meanwhile, Letty is killed in a car accident and this leads into Dominic and Brian coming together once again to find her killer and make him pay.I'm not gonna say this movie was bad, but I kinda hate and love this movie at the same time. What made the action work previously is the car chases and underground racing, but that is still present here, so I can't blame this movie for not having car chases.The over-the-top action is just lazy, except for the climactic car chase at the end of the film and the chase between Brian O'Conner and a criminal at the beginning of the film in Los Angeles. I saw previews of this movie online and on TV and I had mixed feelings when I watched this for the very first time.The music is just cool. I give Brian Tyler a lot of credit, but I don't want to talk about the entire musical score for the film.The acting is kind of a mixed bag of popcorn and gummy worms for me because some of the actors do their job and some of them does not.I give credit to the four main actors who play the four main characters even though Michelle Rodriguez does not have a lot of screen time, she does a very good job. The film saw the return of Sung Kang as Han Seoul-Oh and to tell you the truth, he does a great job. Gal Gadot plays Gisele Yashar and she is a new introduction to the film series, but unfortunately, she does not have a lot of screen time either, but does really good.The villains played by Laz Alonso and John Ortiz are okay, but Laz Alonso was miscast in this film. Nothing against him, but I like him in Stomp the Yard and Jumping the Broom, but this is the only film that I think he did not work. John Ortiz plays Braga in this film and he gives a good decent performance, but even then, it's incredibly over the top.So, overall, I have mixed feelings about Fast and Furious 4, while I like the music, story, action and some of the acting, I can't get over the fact that the Letty Ortiz character was killed off. I give it a 5 out of 10, because they tried their best and I don't think it's as bad as people say it is.Now, if the movie would have been 124 minutes long, it would have been fine.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","myblueblazer","2 June 2023","Review:It's really more of the same stuff from the first three movies with the cars. So nothing really new. However I am glad that we finally got an actual direct sequel to the Original movie with The Four Main Stars returning (Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, and Brewster)Takeaways:
-The Four main characters of the first movie are back and reunited!! Yay! Well that's actually a little misleading, because SPOILER........................................ Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is seemingly shot and killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie! This of course sets that whole plot in motion, and causes Brian Dominic and Mia to reunite to track down the guy responsible-The whole cast is great again, and it's like they never even left!-Vin Diesel is Back!!! Dominic Torretto was still Street racing and still robbing things with Letty. They have been hiding in the Dominican Republic with new comrade Han Lue (a returning Sung Kang. This movie took place before his death in Movie 3.) however Dom is angry after Letty is killed and he is going after the man who killed her for vengeance. He strikes a deal with Brian O'Connor to help bust the criminal operation that Letty's killer is a part of, and in exchange, Brian will make sure Dom gets a pardon and pass from prison for his help. Dom doesn't care about not running, until he finds out that Letty was secretly working with Brian to get Dom's Criminal record wiped, by investigating the crime gang. That was what May have gotten her killed.-Also from this point Foward, Vin Diesel is now one of the guardians of the franchise. Vin Diesel has more involvement with the franchise as series Producer and not just as a Star.-Paul Walker nails it again as Brian! Brian O'Connor is now an FBI Agent tracking down the car crime gang, responsible for Letty's murder. He must also redeem himself in the eyes of the family that he betrayed. At first Dom and Mia want nothing to do with him, because he broke their trust years ago, when he revealed that he was an undercover cop investigating them. When they all team up to get Justice for Letty, Brian eventually reconciles with both of them and he also restarts his relationship with Mia.-Gal Gadot debuts as Street racer Giselle Yashar.-I love that Dom and Brian had a Race Rematch. Though we don't know who actually won lol.-Letty is avenged when Dom shoots down her murderer. He then decides that he is Done with running and with crime, and turns himself in, with the hopes that Brian can fulfill his end of the bargain and clear him.The ending was sad when, the Judge could not fulfill Brian's request and give Don freedom and he sentences Dom to a long time in prison. Brian is furious that the Justice system failed Dom, so he and Mia decide to bust him out of the prison transport. As a result all three of them are now in hiding.Conclusion: it is a sequel that puts a step step in the right direction, and starts a good action packed Brian/Dom/Letty storyline that concludes with the 7th film.","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","coreycat09","3 April 2009","I saw this movie about an hour ago.. overall i was pretty pleased with it the action is great. but the writing was a bit off some of the dialogue seemed corny and unnecessary.. i found my self almost laughing at lines that were supposed to be dramatic.. kinda like in twilight. id say it wasn't as good as the first but definitely the second best of the series.. the reason the first was better is because JA RULE was in it ha.. its not how you stand by your car, its how you race your car haha..only other complaint i guess is that its not really about racing anymore.. for example the first one was more about the culture of underground street racing.oh and Mia in this movie is a bit scary i guess she forgot how she did the original role because she almost looks like she has a joker smile ha","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","sinncross","16 April 2009","When an oil truck hijacking goes wrong, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) is forced to leave his girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodirguez) and his current crew. However it is not long until he is brought to Los Angeles in order to infiltrate a high speed delivery service under the control of Ramon Campos. At the same time, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), an FBI agent, has been following a trail of drug deliveries and his investigation leads him to Campos.A sequel to 2 Fast 2 Furious and a prequel to Tokyo Drift, Fast and Furious brings back the cast of the original to give the series a reboot of such, as if Tokyo Drift did not attempt the same feat already. As such, Fast and Furious is very much on par with the first two films: it goes back to home territory in America, and ditches the drifting for pure speed racing. Though there is only a single race in the entire film with various chase sequences, so the main appeal of the film, street racing, is not entirely utilized to full effect. Nevertheless, Fast and Furious does attempt to tell a reasonably interesting story. Reasonably because it never really works by the film's end. The story does not take long to give an emotional pull for the audience, but it pans out rather uninterestedly. Toretto and O'Conner have their own agendas' in the main story arc but it becomes far too neatly wrapped. Any calamities brought about by the first two films, such as O'Connor's betrayal of Mia, are brushed aside and given far too conventional, and easy explanations. Make no mistake, Fast and Furious is all about style over substance.The acting department is not entirely better, but credit must be given to a cast that does indeed try to get the film's feel right with their respective characters. But neither Rodrigruez, Brewster, or the main two, Walker and Diesel, feel anything more then caricatures. And this is a great pity as the script wants to give them more depth but it becomes overshadowed but moderate acting and a weak attempt at story telling; an average script with some weak dialogue doesn't help matters for the actors either.Though while the film lacks depth it does make up for in its method. The entire film oozes sex appeal from the main cast, the many scantily clad women engaging in rather intimate situations, and the lineup of vehicles. The latter does not play as much of a visual importance as seen in Tokyo Drift which is an indication of the film's more character driven narrative. Car sequences mainly revolve around chases with only a single race event taking place. While races would have made for more exciting set pieces the chases do their job at entertaining. Credit must be given to director Justin lin, who provides some stunning cinematography. He is also quite knowledgeable to invoke symbolism into his filming style for a few scenes. One such has O'Connor, on foot, chasing after a man: the scene is shot in quite a jumpy and jagged manner. However the car sequences are far more smooth, as if the main characters are more in their element while riding a car, then they are as themselves.There is no sex or nudity, beyond two focuses on two different sets of lesbians kissing and fondling and many provocative outfits and dancing. Violence is never intense but the car sequences show enough wrecked damage. Language is kept down to mostly scatological terms with no hard swearing.It might be clichéd, but Fast and Furious is both fast and furious though it becomes painstakingly obvious as the film develops that it lacks self-control. It is great to see the old cast return but it all feels like a rather forced effort to relive the glory days of the original. The story tries too much to make all characters comfortable with one another; the acting is never up to standard; and there is sadly only one race scene. The director is really the only person who kick starts the films engine: it is a decent film, but it requires a good load of tuning if it wants to score big.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","xjeffreyxnothing-1","7 April 2009","I got a chance to see the new ""Fast & Furious"" movie this weekend. I gotta say I was expecting a huge blockbuster movie filled with fun and action much like its predecessors. Unfortunately I may have set the bar too high as I was thoroughly disappointed. I have been a huge fan of the ""Fast & Furious"" series for years as they are great for the purpose they were made for: To entertain. I felt that this newest installment took it self a bit too seriously and that it could have used a lot more ""fun"". The feel of the movie was a bit awkward as the cast has not worked together in almost 8 years. It was as if they were uncomfortable coming together again. What I also did not understand is where part 2 fit into this whole equation. It was as if the producers dusted off part 2 as if it never existed. I did like how they linked this movie to part 3(Tokyo Drift) however, as it is my favorite in the series. Overall I would have to give this movie a 6/10. It would probably be lower if I was not a fan of the series and actually cared to see what has happened with it's characters.","5/10"

When making more than three films off one film it seems like they tie the fourth film in with the others somewhere to make the plot make sense. Along in this one is all about fast cars, fist fights, and chase scenes. Since all the characters are in the first movie, it makes this movie better to watch as if having replaced the characters with new actors as done with some films that have more than one off of the first film. Having watched the first film of the fast and the furious, you should check this one out because it might intrigue you as much as the first film did.

"Fast & Furious","znox85","11 April 2009","So, first off, I was truly not expecting to watch a great movie here. Had low expectations, maybe because in my opinion ""Tokyo Drift"" was not a good movie at all. Friend of mine previously watches it on the cinema, and told me it was a good movie after all, so I decided to give it a try and to watch it. In the first 5min of it, it truly takes your breath away! So much action going on, so great ideas, and a great plot, that lets you truly guessing what comes next. The cast is brilliant once again (First Movie), and the Action is just overwhelming, if just makes you feel like you driving, and in the middle of the action. If you love speed, and you love race movies, you gonna love this. Even if you just like action, or looking for a good story, go and watch it! This is so far the best from the Fast and Furious series. And if they decide to make another one (what I think they will after this brilliant movie), I think it's gonna be very difficult to surpass this one! If by all this, you still can't decide if you should watch it or not, just watch the Trailer in HD! If you liked it, then you gonna love the movie! I give it a 10! this is so far the best movie of the year! And believe me I watched a lot! Excellent movie, from the beginning till the end!","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","super_sportbolt","6 August 2009","I am a HUGE fan of cars. There are some cool ones in here. The problem with this movie is not the story line although it is a cliché. I realize that these kinds of things don't happen in real life which makes it more a fantasy than a drama but I think that the directors of movies like this should use real life physics when considering making movies like this or otherwise advertise it as more a Speed Racer type flick. The action in this movie is so unrealistic it is sickening. First of all, I have to say that I love classic cars so much that I get very upset when movies destroy these pieces of our history. Before long, there will be none left at the rate they are destroying these. Okay, now aside from that, if you have even driven these cars like Chevelles and Torinos, you will know that they quite simply just don't handle that well so those sequences in the tunnels are so unrealistic it is sickening. Second of all, who in their right mind would spend a small fortune either buying a wrecked or abandoned classic car and doing all that very expensive and time consuming work to make it look beautiful and handle well only to so readily destroy it? It would be a lot cheaper and quicker to buy a small import of newer American car for the muscle and handling ability. The parts are plentiful, cheap, and most of the cars that they buy are already fairly well set up for speed. It is less time and money consuming to build a newer more readily available car for what they were doing. can't be that easy to get those kind of classic cars and parts to the Virgin Islands for the beginning sequences either. Here is another part that is bad in the movie to me...the FBI is supposedly on the lookout for Toretto...so why would they not know he is going this stuff in one of our own territories? Anyone? Let's suppose he did fly under the radar there, they knew when he got into the states immediately. Was he carrying around about $15-20k in his wallet to buy all the parts and pay for the work to hurry up and fix up that Chevelle SS that (lets assume is genuine - although likely a clone at best) he put a blower and all the electronics and high compression goodies into? That car would have taken weeks to do by one person...even if he is a wizard with mechanics.If you are a classic car lover or a good story lover, pass on this movie. It is a shame because Vin Diesel has done some great movies as far as I am concerned. Knockaround Guys, Riddick movies, for example were good movies. This movie was more like a fantasy like XXX than like a realistic crime fighting racer flick.","6/10"

The only decent cars in the entire movie are the ones that Dom's sister drives, Dom's dad's car and one that is is shown driven twice my a supporting actor. I feel they went the completely wrong direction with this movie and forgot about what we all go to see Fast & the Furious films for, sick cars and action packed racing. Hopefully they will come out with another one when they have remembered what the movies became famous for.

It aims, it shoots, and misses. The special effects were pretty, but disappointing. With all cars virtually going the same speed (which appeared to be about 50 MPH tops)and cars not damaging the way they should, this movie really bugged me since I do love speed and cars. However, it was nice to see some of the original caste, such as Vin and Paul. The plot still closely intertwined with ""respect of the street"" and this time a hint of revenge, and nothing makes an action movie like the drive for revenge. If you loved the first movie in the series (The Fast & The Furious), then you will probably love this one as well. As for me, this movie isn't my cup of tea and there wasn't too much to love about this movie, which is why it gets 5 stars.","3/10"

"Fast & Furious","hereuser","28 July 2023","The order of the Fast and Furious movies is a bit confusing ,but I guess the idea is to have retrospect.This is the most original FnF movie you can watch. There's your all time scene of Vin Diesel stealing a gasoline truck and having an incredible cascade just in the first 10 minutes of the movie.I'm so sorry to myself that I never had the opportunity to see this on big screen.The plot:
10/10 as every Fast and Furious movie the plot is always different ,but with one common target. To get yourself out of some type of pit and becoming the so called ""champion""The acting:
We have Vin Diesel , Paul Walker and Sung Kang , there's no way not to enjoy it.","7/10"

"Fast & Furious","stewiefan201","11 April 2009","Fast & Furious is the fourth installment in THE Fast and THE Furious saga. Apparently the title has painted itself into a corner, and taking out the two ""The's"" constitutes the title for a new installment. But getting past that this movie is basically about what you would expect from this series: Fast cars, sexy women, tough guy mentality E.T.C. Except here's something exciting: The whole original cast is back in action for the first time since the original movie. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster! The plot very basically involves Dominic Toretto (Diesel) wanting revenge on one of his enemies, and in the process has to re-team and form an alliance with his betrayer Agent Brian O' Conner (Walker). That's about it in the plot department. The rest of the movie is full of chase scenes through L.A. streets, Mexican deserts, secret tunnels, and many boring talky scenes between the characters.When Fast & Furious isn't getting bogged down in all the boring dramatic scenes, it's actually a very entertaining movie. The racing and chasing car sequences are exciting and well filmed, and you can really tell a lot of effort and stunt work went into making these scenes exciting. The film opens with Dominic and his cronies stealing giant oil tanks from the biggest tanker truck you will ever see on-screen or in real life. All of this as Michelle Rodriguez is hanging from the side of the truck, an inch away from death, and Dominic comes to her rescue. The races are what makes the movie enjoyable, just like any of the other Fast and the Furious titles. The original movie was an entertaining flick, I remember 2 Fast 2 Furious being awesome (Although I was 12 when I last watched it), and Tokyo Drift, well, I've never seen it. However the real draw-in for this new installment was the return and re-pairing (pun intended) of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, along with Rodriguez and Brewster. It is a welcome return for them in the series and they make this entry memorable. When you get to watch Diesel and Walker race cars with nitro-power for the first time since 2001, you'll be gripping the edge of your seat.However there are quite a few problems with Fast & Furious, although they are very obvious. The acting is not too good, the dialogue is just plain bad and there are way too many talky scenes, and the plot is thinner than construction paper. Whereas the action scenes are entertaining, the dialogue scenes are stiff and dull. There are way too many of them, and most of them just fall flat due to the bad lines and the dead acting. Diesel and Walker both make cool tough guys on screen, but that does not make their technical acting skills any better. They are just dead weight when they're not behind the wheel of a car, and that's just plain disappointing. As for the plot...what plot? I barely even noticed it until the ending and at that point I was confused by what they were doing in Mexico. I also barely even realized John Ortiz was the bad guy until the ending as well, which is obviously not a good thing. That means that except for the movie's main twist (Which takes place in the first 15 minutes), I barely even noticed that there was a plot at all. Now I know you don't go to see a Fast and the Furious movie for the plot, characters, and acting. But if all of those details were better then Fast & Furious would have been a much more satisfying film as a whole, and there is nothing wrong with that.Overall Fast & Furious accomplishes what it set out to do. Which is to entertain you with slick chase/race sequences, incredible stunts and special effects, and the cool presence (Not acting) of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Fans of the series will probably enjoy it. I enjoyed it for what it was and I can't even call myself a fan of the series. I give Fast & Furious a good 3 out of 5. It's a fun blockbuster movie that entertains you when it doesn't talk too much.","6/10"

"Fast & Furious","doubleb58","14 January 2014","The Fast and the Furious series got really weak when the first sequel came out without Vin Diesel. Paul Walker is great, but can't carry the series alone. The franchise completely died when Tokyo Drift came out. It was an OK movie, but a sign to everyone that Fast and the Furious was done. We were proved wrong, as Fast and Furious 4 is a good reboot to the series. Plenty of action and excitement. Also the original cast has returned. I thought it was the best of the series...that is until I saw Fast and Furious 6. I'm very curious to see how they fit Paul Walker's death into Brian's character. The studio just announced they would use his already completed scenes for Fast and Furious 7 that comes out in 2015. This series has been getting better with each sequel that comes out, which is the exact opposite of what usually happens. Looking forward to the next one!","8/10"
"Fast & Furious","Hysteria28","29 July 2010","'Fast and the furious' from 2001 was a trend setter. The movie not only had a routine plot but introduced the theme of street racing so beautifully to the screen. It incorporated a story as well as satisfying racing and action scenes. Rob Cohen presented the movie with such style and the computer graphics seemed natural. This is the fourth movie in the series, which in my opinion should have been the sequel. Justin Lei has directed the movie with his style and has avoided replicating what the previous directors did in the series. I'm sure that his career will sustain in the long run if he continues at this rate. He has made the movie on a more mature scale however the MTV style is very evident throughout. C.g.i is implemented at a large amount. Unfortunately the quality of it is quiet poor in contrast to how it appeared in the previous movies. This made many of the action scenes appear cartoonish that one could not avoid noticing it.Once again the audience is presented with the same routine theme of drug dealers and smuggling. This was also the main theme in '2 fast 2 furious'. This time round there is not a different perspective on viewpoint to the plot. The writing has more substance and the plot is more thicker. Walker once again takes on the role of the infiltrator who has to bring to justice a dealer who is bringing in high quantities of illegal substances from Mexico. I could not understand why there was less emphasis given to the action scenes as this is what the whole franchise is about. The movie contains 4 chase scenes. However in three of them the quality is lacking. They are shot in dark surroundings and the clarity is quiet poor. However the underground scenes were impressive. The first scene is truly outstanding and exciting to watch. SPOILERS The movie begins with Vin and Rodriguez risking it again with attempting to take tankers of gasoline with the assistance of a few friends. After a failed attempt Toretto decides to stay low for a while and go underground. He is later shocked to discover that Letty was murdered. He returns to LA and meets his sister Jordana who takes him to Letty's crash scene. His lead takes him to a drug dealer that Walker too wants to apprehend. They both decide to join forces and infiltrate in to his gang by taking part in street race. At a drug deal they plan to get him arrested. But it does not work out. The dealer escapes. However his love interest gives Vin his whereabouts information. END OF SPOILERS. Upon viewing the movie one will feel that they are watching a undercover cop movie. But without a doubt that is what this is. More attention is given to the story than on the action. The content is high on the cop versus bad guy scenario. The highlight is without a doubt the first scene. The enjoyment element was at a high point. I had wished that the movie sustained with that same level. The emotional impact that the characters have experienced through the first movie is very clearly depicted here. They are not youngsters anymore and are managing to adapt to a normal livelihood. But personal intentions bring them altogether to face danger. The director has given a good effort and the movie has been directed to standard. However it does not quiet manage to surpass the original. It will always remain superior in the franchise. The movie reunites the four characters from the original. But the on screen chemistry does not sparkle to a large extent. Jordana Brewster gets limited scope and there is neither a scene where she is behind the wheel. Her involvement in the plot is limited to nothing. Michelle Rodriguez has two scenes. As she was a huge asset in the original I was hoping to see more of her. I could not understand why the writer had to give her such a brief appearance. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are at the centre of the movie. But Vin was very calm in many of scenes and does not show much enthusiasm in his acting. He was not displaying the usual intensity which is evident in many of the roles which he has done. However in the driving department he performs to the best of his ability.Overall this is a commendable effort but a true fan of the original will be slightly disappointed with action scenes as they do not contrast high in quality with the original. Plot wise there is more development.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","obrofta","13 April 2009","The only spoiler here is the underwhelming comments of movie critics. My spouse and I saw the other three installments, and although we were not a big fan of the first one (we liked 2 best), the pro and antagonists hit the mark. We have the same two back again and although the plot may be thin it's there, it's simple and it works (not to spoil for those who haven't seen the movie). Additionally, the action sequences and special effects are riveting at times. My business partners son is a computer geek, and he prides himself on his knowledge of good special effects, and he thought that while another current release action adventure movie with superheroes had terrible special effects, this film captured his attention as well. Again, I liked two and three better, and my spouse thought this installment was the second best behind 2 Fast, 2 Furious. Good looking cars, people, special effects and the music fits the feast. In fact, I couldn't get my spouse out of her seat while the credits were rolling. (She told me it was because she thought something may come up in the credits, a device similar to some recent movies, but I know she just liked the music!)Give us fans a high five as an encore, maybe ... ""way too fast for the furious."" (Please bring back Vin, Paul and Jordana)","8/10"

"Fast & Furious","smitda04","6 February 2014","I have tried to grasp the understanding of the Fast and Furious movies. An angry man meets an angry woman who meets another angry man, and all of these angry-chip-on-their-shoulder people have to much estrogen or testosterone so they have to fight, drive, cuss, smoke, drink to the death! Oh, I know, let us find the easiest way to make a million bucks. Lets hire some real good actors to do real crappy characters, mix in a little drama with a little action, and some real nice cars, and WOW! A million bucks. If Hollywood ever decides they want to maybe add a story line to a car movie, then maybe I can give that movie a good critique. However, I am one man, most people will continue to watch these movies over and over again, and they won't think a thing about it. This is why the movie business will stay how it always has been. Real crafty movie making, and real ignorant movie goers.","4/10"
"Fast & Furious","woutfontane","7 April 2009","For the people who don't like the F&F series: Don't go watch it, because everything that makes you don't like this movie is in it. But on the other side, for all of you who are a fans of the series: this is a must see, because everything that makes you like this movie is in it. Fast cars, trusted characters and needless to say, a lot of action. The plot isn't the strongest aspect of this film, neither is the level of acting. But I get the feeling the creators of the movie didn't want it to be strong, compelling, innovating or confronting. 'Just sit back and enjoy the ride'. And if you let the movie take control of you, it will be a crazy one.Me, being a fan of the series, liked this movie a lot. Therefore I give it a 7/10.

""Fast & Furious 4"" emerges as the fourth installment in the series, presenting itself to the audience. The film maintains its focus on action and adrenaline, making a return with familiar characters from previous movies. Starring Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, this installment follows the team's endeavor to tackle the criminal underworld.The action scenes and car races continue to be the foundational elements of the series. Quick cuts and captivating visual effects succeed in keeping the audience glued to the screen. However, the plot can sometimes be predictable and lacking depth. Character development is emphasized less than in the previous films, which leaves the film somewhat incomplete in this aspect.From a visual perspective, the film's choice of locations and its cinematography are impressive. Scenes set in various places provide viewers with visual diversity. The movie offers a satisfying experience for enthusiasts of action and speed, while it could have invested more effort into crafting a more intricate story and character depth.In conclusion, ""Fast & Furious 4"" maintains the characteristic action of the series, yet it bears some shortcomings in terms of its plot and character development. It could be engaging for fans of the series, but might not prove as satisfying for viewers seeking more depth.","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","dbarr123","22 May 2023","They put way too much emphasis on nitrous oxide in all the races. But if you've had any experience at all with cars or street racing, you know that nitrous oxide isn't all that the movie makes it out to be. You don't simply turn it one whenever you want to win or accelerate at random. It's really sad that they don't focus on the cars themselves more.To all the others. Please only review the movie itself. Don't simply complain about ads. Ads are advertisements. Advertisements are commercials. Commercials are commerce and commerce is money. They need money to make the game so complaining about ads is just a waste of everyone's time.","9/10"

"Fast & Furious","sahil-ganguly","9 April 2009","I expected big things from this movie, especially with the poster showing all the original movie cast and the exciting trailer. But disappointing is the exact word that describes this movie for me.The story has never been a strong point of the Fast & the Furious series. Well, neither is the acting for that matter. What is most important is the good amount of orgasmic cars and adrenaline pumping racing on show! But the director probably thought they'd try and give the series a new look. Bad idea.Here's why. The story, if you look closely enough, is littered with loopholes and while that is generally overlooked in a F&F movie, it can't be when it is being given a lot of importance. Vin Diesel probably has just two expressions in his repertoire, and he used them to the fullest in this movie, especially when he was in the emotional scenes.Coming to the action. This is where a F&F movie redeems itself. But sadly there is only ONE proper race in this movie, and 3 other action sequences with cars. Which is disappointing to say the least! When people think about this series, its all about the cars and the racing. But apparently it wasn't for this movie. Even Paul Walker's good guy-tough cop routine couldn't save this movie.I'm a big fan of the series, and if this movie wouldn't have had the cast, then I would have rated it below Tokyo Drift. But it manages JUST enough to better the previous installment. If this would have been some other movie and not a F&F sequel, I probably would have rated it higher. But since it is, I give it 5/10.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","alan_robinson","16 April 2009","Firstly I would like to state that this movie is after 2 fast 2 furious I know this because it has been five years since Mia last saw Brian we find this out when she is sitting with him in the dinner. also Brian as just been reinstated with the police where in the second movie Brian was on the run from the cops and ends up helping them out thus giving them the opportunity to clear his name and reinstate him also in this movie he is a much better driver as he is in 2 fast 2 furious were at the end of the first movie he is still not that great.Now for a quick review this movie definitely has a different feel to its predecessors. It is much more about the people in it appose to the cars. The cars in this movie I would have to say are the worst out of all the movies. Unless you're in to old American muscle. The only car I really liked was the Skyline R34 the Subaru was just ugly. Other than this I thought the movie was great it was nice to see that the story had taken a different turn we didn't have the norm. We now have two paths the one of Dominic who is after Fenix for the murder of Letty and then we have Brian working for the cops trying to bring down Campos while at the same time trying to keep Dominic out of jail. The end of the movie was great and leads the way for the 5th. If you are a Fast and Furious fan you really need to see this one as it is a must see.","5/10"
"Fast & Furious","lythis-love","19 April 2019","I found that the fourth part was more mature then the ones before. You had the usual racing, no-logic, Little Story, women who willingly offer themselves to anybody and the original cast. But thought it wasn't so dump and flat this time. The actors even... acted from time to time. I liked Vin Diesel very much here.The idea of Brian of beeing a cop and beeing a criminal annoyed me very much. As if no one really had to pay for the crimes they have commited.
Well Dom seemed to get like 25 years in prison at the end, which shook me a lot as it ended so abruptly. Sure the Boys and one Girl where about to save him from that...Again the message here: Laws are for the usual People and with a fast car you can just escape?","6/10"
"Fast & Furious","ennieday09","8 October 2009","We loved the Fast and the Furious franchise for three cars, hot girls, and the duo of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. I was so happy that they brought back another Fast and the Furious movie with the original characters because the Tokyo Drift film prior to this couldn't have been more irrelevant to the franchise. The movie starts off by starting the film with what the series is best known for, hot cars and Vin Diesel stunt-driving in a hot car along with Michelle Rodriguez who I have always loved. The adrenaline rush you get just from the opening scene makes you smile ans say YES the Fast and the Furious is back. After the fuel truck is done flipping and exploding, a second scene takes place of a detective tracking down a vigilante on a wild foot chase. You know who this is, Brian O'Conner. Just from the first two scenes of exploding fuel trucks and a guy driving another guy through a two story window leaves you saying wow, well it did for me anyway.After all the action has cleared, the main story of the film starts to take place in which Dom leaves to escape from getting caught by the cops once again. Months after his departure, he gets a phone call from his sister Mia saying Letty was murdered. Now the emotional tone of the film sets when one of the loving characters from the franchise is gone. The entire film focuses on Dom getting revenge against the gang that murdered Letty as does it also focus on Paul Walker's character tracking down the same group of people. Fast and the Furious 4, if thats what you wanna call it, sticks to what it was known for and thats what fans of the movie want to see. There are great heart pumping scenes of fast car chases that never lets up. The ending with Dom going to jail, and then having Brian and Mia trying to get him out couldn't have been a more perfect ending. For those who are wanting what they gave you in the first Fast and the Furious movie, this one is just that.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","nvjs","18 March 2013","OK, clearly FF was clearly aimed at exploiting fellow gearheads like myself. But while appeasing us, it's also not excluding non-enthusiasts. For the ""jargon"" of shop talk, those who are not in the know, it may sound Greek. What I didn't like about the film; was the formulaic clichés of countless antagonists.The ""sudden twist"" ? Been there, done it. Paul Walker seems content with his flying off the handle shtick and while that suits Running Scared, it seems as though he doesn't pull anything else off. Don't get me started on Diesel though! This movie, did the genre of car related themes, pretty good. For instance: Han. Did Lin not consider the ramifications of killing him in the third film ? That feels like he was back-tracking to make it work.The story is supplemental in a effort to actually...well have a story! For, a car themed movie, It probably seems unnecessary, excessive, or outlandish. What this movie has going for it is plenty of hotties, coveted cars, and eye candy stunts. I will say this much: in contrast to Gone in 60 Seconds, F&F is Hemingway. Gone in...dumped plot in lieu of action. Bruckheimer's trademark. Just don't view F&F hoping for intellectual stimulation. If you want to see bad ass cars, this IMHO, is the best of the quadrilogy. That's my un-wanted $0.02. Ultimately, I think the franchise's attempt to add a cohesive, integral plot has yet to be pulled off. Maybe, it's better off sticking to car chases and a lot less...ambition in story.","10/10"

"Fast & Furious","prestonwardcondra","9 August 2015","The fourth Fast & Furious movie was basically the two main protagonists in the series Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) rekindling a long, lost friendship after the two hadn't seen each other in over five years.That's the whole premise of the movie. The whole driving that the series is known for takes a backseat here and Diesel and Walker start to develop a brotherly love relationship.To be honest? The only part of the movie that is worth your time watching is the last 15 minutes. Without giving much away, it's a fun, heist through Mexico that saves the movie from being mediocre. It's not the greatest movie of all time you will watch, but it will suffice you enough without having to skip selecting scenes and what have you.","2/10"
"Fast & Furious","Marco_AGJ","5 November 2009","The new Fast and Furious movie follows the story of the first movie and brings Vin Diesel back to business. This sounds pretty good, Vin Diesel fits right in for this kind of role and in the first movie he was great. And this is actually a pretty solid movie, one might be deceived by the movie's introduction which sound too unreal even for Fast and Furious standards -- more of Torque standards. Sometimes they just try too hard on first impressions. The rest of the movie flows solidly with a decent story surrounding the action.What attracts most people into seeing this movie is certainly the cars and the crazy thing done with them in the streets, even though I would've hoped for more tuned cars and more crazy drivers running, the content is not bad. Things just got a little cheesier with the narration of the GPS. The excessive use of CGI is also nothing to be proud of, it's never a bad deal to change that absolutely impossible stunt made by computer for another not-that-much but performed in real life.It does serve right for those looking for a movie with the adrenaline at constant high rate. I just wish they would focus more on the mindless action than trying to have something Fast and Furious most likely will never have, a deep complex story. Who knows, if they really focused on what they do right they would provide everything at the right dose and would, even indirectly, add some depth, but still focusing on illegal racing, with an illegal racer as the protagonist.","9/10"
"Fast & Furious","cibyll-1","14 April 2009","Everybody knows the story and the ratings of the Furious movies. Since the first one, something gone wrong and all the actors and all the movies made a wrong turn. The second part was good and the third OK, but the changes made it worse than the others. And now, here are they again. The original cast is back, and the 4th movie works. I think the most reason is Vin Diesel, who made this franchise famous. His character, Dom is the essence in the Furious films. Paul Walker of course is still good in his role, and the girls too.The story is OK, nothing special, but enough. Runtime is 107 minutes, that is a special happiness for me. I hate short movies! Here, everybody has enough time to feel the mood. The car scenes are cool, and there is a lot of good known action, where Mr. Diesel shows us how to do... Fine! The rating is OK, this movie is a big thumb up!!!","5/10"

"Fast & Furious","jonnyk12","16 April 2009","Fast and Furious 12A - *** I haven't seen the other three films of the fast and furious series so I didn't really know where everyone was at for this film, and apparently this is set in-between the first and the second film (this is the forth), just to confuse everyone. This could be seen as the first actual sequel, but as already said this didn't mean anything to me.Its starts off with Vin Diesel and his gang stealing oil from and oil tanker thing which is definitely one of the highlights of the film, after this there is cop Paul Walker chasing down this guy who eventually gives him a name who they track down though the rest of the film. Hopefully you won't go to see the film for the story, but what I picked up was that this is a revenge movie of sorts.The cast was alright, there's only really two of mention which is Paul Walker who does fine, it's not anything amazing but it wasn't bad. The other actor is Vin Diesel, I'm not too keen on Vin Diesel. I don't much like his voice, he body doesn't make sense and I don't really think he's a good actor, but I guess he does great at being what Vin Diesel does.Obviously the main feature of this film is cars, which there are a few off. Am not really into to cars, but even I enjoyed the races, the stunts and the crashes, so if your not into cars either don't worry you should enjoy everything as much as me. If you are into cars you should enjoy them more then me.Overall the story is the weak point, you just end up not caring about anything or anyone and its confusing there being a eight year gap for a sequel. But if you go to the cinema (Odeon preferably) hoping for cars and girls you wont be disappointed, if you go there looking for a complex story and an award winning film you'll be disappointed.","7/10"
"Fast & Furious","merlin6-2","5 April 2009","Don't Liston to the Bull from haters. This is a GREAT Movie for the Action racer at heart. It's not about heavy story line or great dialog. It's about the code of friendship, and fast cars with big mucilage.enjoy with that attitude and you will end felling faster and with more ferocity in life.I myself have a 1989 5.0 Mustang and I have it done to the Tees! every time I step into it it relaxes me and to see this movie makes me appreciate it even more. This movie is not about racing it's about a love for a great gift .the gift to make a great car fell like part of the family","5/10"
"Black Adam","cricketbat","21 October 2022","I was shocked by how much I disliked Black Adam. I didn't really have any expectations for this movie, as the only real knowledge I have about the character comes from the Injustice video game series. However, Black Adam takes all the elements of bad superhero flicks and crams them into one loud & messy movie. While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed.","3/10"
"Black Adam","Fluke_Skywalker","6 January 2023","Black Adam is the cinematic equivalent of a tuneless marching band running endless circles around your increasingly throbbing head. The score is omnipresent and oppressive. The action frantic and relentless. The entire thing just keeps beating you over the head until you throw up your hands and surrender. And then it knocks you to the ground and starts kicking you. Ultimately whatever virtues it may have had are buried under the rubble from its nonstop assault on your senses. Watching this film was like boxing a 'roided up octopus.And speaking of 'roided up, The Rock is the fulcrum of this mindless drivel, and with his relative charm buried deep beneath an ever-present and sweaty sneer, the film's only notable asset is extinguished. That the recently announced reboot of the DC Universe renders the entire affair utterly moot is simply the last shovelful of dirt on its grave.From start to finish, Black Adam is an unpleasant experience. Bad script. Bad acting. Bad CGI. Bad movie.","3/10"
"Black Adam","pc95","18 December 2022","Large budgeted and badly disjointed, ""Black Adam"" belongs in the poor category with the likes of ""Justice League"" and ""Superman vs Batman"". The story is hackneyed, and the dialog is eye-rolling with terrible worn out humor. It feels like a bad imitation of better Marvel movies. Its too bad as there are some good costume and character designs. I don't think a an ancient awakened god would be spouting out sarcasm of today hipsters. It is better than WonderWoman 1984, but that's not saying too much. Alot of actoin scenes with not much to show for it, I'd give this one a miss and rate it a low 5/10.","5/10"
"Black Adam","martinrobertson300482","13 November 2022","I hoped ""Black Adam"" would be a decent entry in DC's recent output as its linked with ""Shazam"" which might be their best recent movie. But nope. Its another CGI filled dud.On the plus side there is an effort put into the story and Dwayne Johnson and his rediculusly strong shoulders buldging from his costume are 100 percent real amongst all the boring CGI. But all the team building with rubbish characters no one cares about has already been DC's downfall with the justice league, Suicide squad and even that Harley Quinn movie. And it's takes up too much time here too.There's not enough time dedicated to making us care about any of these minor characters and their random powers. Just action, action, action that doesn't matter when you don't care about anyone in the movie.There's some decent gags in the movie I suppose. But overall its just alot of green screen and feels like your watching a computer game instead of a movie. It's more ""Aquaman"" than ""Shazam."" So if you liked that one you'll probably like this.","4/10"
"Black Adam","stsorrell","18 December 2022","While Dr Fate may have been introduced first in print, for those of us who aren't followers of the comics, Dr Strange is the sorcerer that we identify more with, simply because we got to see him first and certainly with more depth. Everything about Black Adam felt like a low budget remake of Marvel characters. Hawkman even looked similar to Anthony Mackey. Atom Smasher was far too much like Ant Man. Hawkman's compound might as well been Dr Xavier's home for the X Men, complete with the aircraft rising from the front lawn.Like so many others have reviewed, the Justice Society was simply thrown at us as if we were to already understand who they were. There was no character building whatsoever, other than a one or two sentence dialog that tried to briefly explain how they came to be superheroes. It was extremely rushed.As for Black Adam...I usually like Dwayne Johnson's films, but in this one, he was stiff and wooden. The other characters...of course Dr Fate was a standout, but it was as if the writers purposefully wanted us to hate Hawkman. His attitude and cockiness were unbearable, knowing that he would be easily defeated by the likes of Black Adam. Perhaps in my mind, I was comparing him to Marvel's Falcon and his much more personable and likable demeanor. Either way, I just wanted to see him get his ass kicked.All things considered, I was simply underwhelmed. 2022 was not a good year for the superhero genre.","4/10"
"Black Adam","ryanpersaud-59415","7 January 2023","Black Adam reminds me a lot of X-Men: Dark Phoenix, in that it feels almost like a studio obligation more than it does a passion project. Every aspect of this movie feels slightly phoned in: from the inclusion of the Justice Society, to the final Act, to most of the performances. There's very little passion or enthusiasm here and by the end of it, I was honestly happy it was over.For such a high profile, big budget release, it's honestly shocking how amateurish this movie is at times. The action sequences are flat out terrible, considering how low the stakes are most of the time (i.e., we know Black Adam is going to defeat 99% of the people on screen), and punctuated with endless slow motion sequences that scream a lack of action film making competence.This movie feels like two (or three) films smashed together. We have Black Adam, we have the fictional country of Kandaq and its struggles, and then we have the Justice Society. I guess these elements keep the film from being totally forgettable, but I couldn't help but feel there was a better way to tell this story.It's also really poorly paced, having at three different moments where I thought it was over, only for another plot point to suddenly become relevant again. The dialog is unreal...it's so stilted and silly at times, like when Hawkman (played by Aldis Hodge) lectures Black Adam about ""extrajudicial killing"" mid flight or the constant groan inducing attempts by Noah Centineo's Atom Smasher to give the film a light hearted, Marvel-esque feel with bad jokes. The worst has to be Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), the son of ""kinda sorta"" heroine Isis (played by Sarah Sahi), whose lines are so bad I can't tell if he's a bad actor or a CG generated being with Chat GPT lines programmed into him. I'm serious.I don't like harping on child actors, by my God, is Bodhi Sabongui bad here. So bad that he actively ruins most scenes he's in. But, to be fair, no one, not even The Rock is particularly good in this movie. I've been hearing praise for Pierce Brosnan, but honestly, his hammy performance was legitimately hilarious to me, especially by the end.This movie isn't all bad. There are some cool sequences and shots, the movie does at least explore the morality of a hero killing people and questions what other movies/comics establish as the ""morally right"" approach. I also liked the not-so-subtle commentary about the Justice Society of America essentially invading the fictional Kandaq (where this film takes place) and telling them they can't have a protector of their own. And, some of the actors are just naturally likeable as well; Hodge and Johnson do have chemistry and had one of the best relationships of the whole movie.But honestly, Black Adam feels like another paint-by-numbers, forgettable superhero flick that represents the end of the failed DCEU experiment. As a huge DC fan, it's sad to see some of these characters get such lame on-screen introductions. It's even sadder to know that this movie will be the last time any of us see Henry Cavill as Superman, which...is frankly quite depressing.","4/10"
"Black Adam","StantonDrew","17 November 2022","Was this script the result of a 5th grade class project?It starts with some of the weakest, most contrived world-building I've seen. Moves to some appalling acting, from various children and bad guys especially. This gets compounded by some of the worst dialogue since George Lucas last wrote a screenplay.And it just continues to get worse from there.Now I usually enjoy the dumbest nonsense that Dwayne Johnson stars in. Even Skyscraper, Rampage & San Andreas were watchable, despite being dreadful movies. But there is no saving this one.This latest poor effort from DC makes the most braindead Fast & Furious entry look like Shakespeare.Looking at the director's previous credits it should come as no surprise that this movie is just plain bad.","3/10"
"Black Adam","ObsessiveCinemaDisorder","28 October 2022","While Black Adam isn't a groundbreaking top-tier superhero film, it is an entertaining superhero movie that makes it up with the charm from star Dwayne Johnson as an anti-hero and guilty pleasures including non-stop action, irreverent humor and a high kill count.Dwayne Johnson carves out his own superhero niche with his anti-hero, a concept which the film wholeheartedly commits to. People die in this movie. My mouth dropped at Black Adam's kill count. As the numbers increased, the movie set itself in a tonal sweet spot that Marvel won't go near and Sony hasn't quite achieved with its Spider-Man villain films. What Black Adam does is downright wrong, but it's entertaining as heck to watch it play out.The current culture has become so comic book literate where the story can just introduce a superhero team, the Justice Society of America, without any introduction. You get to know this team in the midst of the action, wondering about their origin stories or how they got their powers. It works, despite being overly stuffed.Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate is quite the scene-stealer, providing gravitas that grounds the conflict at hand and adds another level of seriousness. He's a fascinating character. I hope for a Doctor Fate solo movie with Pierce Brosnan.Aldis Hodge's Hawkman is a great straight man to Dwayne's Black Adam. The heart of the movie comes from the moral argument between them. One character wholeheartedly believes in killing and the other is completely opposed to it. To quote the Dark Knight, this battle of wills is an unstoppable force meeting an unmovable object.In essence, Hawkman sets up for Dwayne Johnson to be Black Adam. The character doesn't want to back one step from his principles and just doesn't give a rats. It's the best part of the film and often hilarious.The villain was not memorable and was just a big baddie for The Rock to fight in the climax. That said, this villain is no worse than the standard Marvel villain in an origin story.In conclusion, Black Adam is a fun movie for a one-time watch. I enjoyed it with my inner Simpsons Comic Book Guy turned off and had a good time.I suspect I won't have the first time experience on a second watch. The seams would crack. I would see that the young JSA members were cast to appeal to the teen demographic and a boy was placed at the center of the story to appeal to children, and the fact that the same boy does a voice-over in the opening credits is odd. On a second watch, I would realize it was all a bit silly.Dwayne Johnson claims Black Adam as the mark of a new era for DC. The film does feel like a rechristening of the DC universe in a soft reboot type way. Now, the plan seems to be moving away from the Walter Hamada era. It always seemed weird to me how Hamada diverted from Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman stories and just focused on side characters and Elseworld projects.I am glad plans are being made to get the DCEU going again. Dwayne Johnson bringing back Henry Cavill's Superman back to the DCEU is a great marketing idea that will guarantee butts in seats, even though it's hard to picture Dwayne Johnson as a star and producer willingly losing the fight.","7/10"
"Black Adam","HeroOfTomorrow","28 October 2022","There's a moment, mid-way through this monstrosity of a movie, where Hawkman tells Black Adam that ""heroes don't kill people!"" The irony of hearing him say this after they accidentally level several city blocks and create massive collateral damage is so hilariously contradictory, the fact that they don't waste another tired joke on that is astounding.This movie... I really don't know where to start. Characters so paper-thin you can (sometimes literally) see right through them; a structure that continuously has you asking ""when is the story going to start?""; a visual miasma of ridiculously dated CGI (yes, show me the speed ramp/slow down EVERY TIME we see cyclone, that won't get old at all!); a complete lack of backstory (what... is... Hawkman?); a villain who can, apparently, just be ripped in half; and technical errors so egregious, I can't believe the incorrect ADR and absurd editing choices got into the Final Cut without the editor deliberately playing a prank on the audience.And the JOKES. Oh my GOD. So many, and they're all so BAD. Not just bad: they completely deflate all tension. Why should I feel stress for a child character if he's quipping all through the drama?Oh, and remember when the rock had a personality? Pepperidge farm remembers. And Pepperidge farm also remembers when movies made sense. ""Let's put black Adam in a cage forever!"" *five minutes later* ""we need black Adam to save the world! Release him from his cage in a ridiculous slow-motion sequence in which a de-powered Black Adam still manages to beat a dozen armed swat teams at a black site!""And what on earth is Black Adam going to do against SUPERMAN?!What a garbage fire.","2/10"
"Black Adam","AdrenalinDragon","28 October 2022","Thought Bland Adam was another misfire for the DCEU Universe. Basically a poor combination of Justice League, Eternals and Shazam! This is a movie I probably won't remember at all in the near future. Too much slo-mo and lack of fun. Pierce Brosnan was probably the highlight as he gives the film a little bit of a spark to the cast of characters.Otherwise very dull characters which you care little about, wonky special effects in places and humour which doesn't work most of the time. Dwayne Johnson has little charisma in this film and I simply didn't care what happened. This was overall kinda bad honestly.3.5/10.","4/10"

Didn't all those bad Suicide Squad/Harley Quinn/Joker films tell us that?Rock looks good but old. Is this a one off for the character or do they weave him into the DC Uni. I guess so since Superman showed up.This is a kid's movie, with kid's plotting, very much a wasted movie.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16.","4/10"
"Black Adam","HabibieHakim123","20 October 2022","Black Adam is not without its flaws, but i still enjoy the hell out of it, the problem that i have with Black Adam is that i never really buy all the Kahndaq people 100%, in the end i only still buy half of it, but i still fine with it, it's not like their characters are terrible, it just most of the time they are doing just a poor performance except the actress who played the mom and probably Ishmael for the most part, at least i still got some of the laughs from one of them, some of the slower scene was sometimes misplaced including some of the flashback, and some nit picky here and there, the rest of Black Adam is an exciting comic book film that fills with a very impressive battle that also fills with dazzling visual and cool style, Black Adam himself played incredibly well by Dwayne Johnson, he was just unstoppable in the most badass way, Justice Society has just become one of my favorite superhero team specifically in movies, they are fun and they are great, Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all of them are a hit for me, i love every single one of them, though i do wish they have something more with Doctor Fate because i think Pierce Brosnan was just unbelievably good playing the characters, again at least we do still have that one moment, i would love to see Justice Society again in movie maybe even their own movie, i would also love to have a specifically Doctor Fate standalone or a prequel film, and last but not least, the main villain, i think the main villain is doing as fine as most of the hero in the movie, so overall Black Adam is a quite a fun ride, 2 hours did feel quite goes by, an exciting back and forth battle that fills with dazzling visual effect and style, great score, great sound, great performances for most of the cast, being the first original DCEU movie that release in theaters only since WW84, Black Adam is not perfect but it's still great, it's still fun, it's still fascinating, it's still exciting, and i enjoy the hell out of it.","8/10"
"Black Adam","masonsaul","22 October 2022","Black Adam certainly has its problems, from it's generic third act (are we really still doing sky beams), terrible villain and very hit and miss humour, however it's still a really fun superhero film thanks to some solid explorations of morality, brief deeper meaning and some ridiculously entertaining superhero fights.Dwayne Johnson gives a great lead performance, restraining his trademark charisma to give a more sombre performance that works. Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo have charming chemistry and are both likeable which makes up for their characters lack of depth or development.However, it's Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate who is definitely the standout with superb dry wit and suave screen presence as well as a surprisingly earnest bond with Aldis Hodge's Hawkman whose stoic and commanding performance makes him inspired casting.Juame Collet-Serra's direction is really good, it lacks an overall voice but makes up for it with plenty of stylish slow motion, needle drops and dynamic camera work. The CG is mostly solid with a fair few weak spots and the music by Lorne Balfe is also really good, extremely epic and operatic in the ways that make everything way more enjoyable.","7/10"
"Black Adam","MackMonMay87","10 November 2022","Black Adam is possibly one of the most generic superhero movies ever made. In a year that also gave us Morbius, that's quite a statement to make, but true. For me, Black Adam sits somewhere between being better than Morbius and Love&Thunder, but far from good.Like many of the DCEU movies, it doesn't set up the characters properly or give us the core reasons we should care about these characters and what their theme is. The Rock's likability and natural charisma and charm is wasted on such a serious, dour character like Black Adam. You can sense the restraint The Rock is using to make Black Adam more ominous and less relatable than his typical schtick, and it makes the character feel clunky as a result.Physically, The Rock is perfectly cast and I've said for many years he should play a comic character. He's one of the few major actors that doesn't need to train at all for the role of a superhero and can show up on-set ready to play the part the day-of. But the physical side can only go so far, and there's moments where The Rock tries to batner with some of the side-characters, but still trying to embody the seriousness of Black Adam, and it just comes off as awkward. Overall, this character just doesn't work for him, and a more standard heroic role with more potential for comedy would've been a better fit.The other heroes introduced, The Justice Society, are for the most part as flat and ineffective as Black Adam himself. It really does seem like Black Adam and the rest of the Justice Society should've been introduced in a previous DCEU project. They have the most ridiculously undercooked plan from a group of superheroes I've seen in a long time, and while the movie tries to hint at self-awareness of this through dialogue, that still doesn't make what they're actually doing with the story good. It really more makes the Justice Society look like clowns. Pierce Brosnan is the best performance in the movie, to nobody's surprise, but even then we get so little of why we should care about the JS and who their characters are. I have to give a mention to Cyclone being arguably the most worthless character in a superhero movie ever. Her tactic against Black Adam, a being as strong as Superman, is to toss pipes at him with the wind, and she contributes more or less nothing the rest of the movie.The movie tries to sell Black Adam as an anti-hero, and tries to make attempts at a sort of moral grey-area, but it falls flat. Intergang, the force invading Khandaq, is objectively evil without any redeeming reason to be there, so when Black Adam kills them, there's not really a sense of shock or any moral deliberation. They're remorseless scumbags conquering a country for their resources (Eternium, not only seeming like a blatant rip-off of Black Panther regardless of whichever came first in the comics, but also the most poorly named fictional material since Unobtanium in Avatar), so aside from the act of murder itself, which they bring on themselves by attempting to mortally kill Black Adam, there's really not much of a moral quandary here. Nothing Black Adam does in the movie embodies the ""anti"" part of being an anti-hero. His actions never lead to an innocent person dying or even getting slightly hurt. This is the kind of content missing from something like Black Adam, that could actually drive a sense of consequence and drama, stuff like that is supposed to be the foundation of comic book stories, but they shy away from taking the story there and attempting to tell us who the characters are through goofy dialogue rather than actions.To contrast with Black Adam, look at another former WWE-star in a DC production: John Cena as Peacemaker from his own show with the same name and '21's The Suicide Squad. Peacemaker actually does hold morally questionable views, is introduced to us as a criminal psychopath, and is blatantly antagonistic to the lead character. In his own show, he grows from these aspects of character and becomes less sociopathic, which is interesting to watch. The main difference there is that The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker had the involvement of James Gunn, who actually knows how to craft oddball characters with a sense of love and a way of making even the weirdest characters endearing.Black Adam shows that after all this time, even with some successes in recent years, the DCEU still doesn't consistently know how to craft interesting characters that feel at least somewhat fleshed out in an inter-connected universe. Everything about Black Adam feels as if a machine was given all the typical elements of a modern superhero movie and made to produce one, without any of the heart or regard to character, or what makes the genre really work. It's good enough to not be awful, but not good enough to be memorable.","5/10"
"Black Adam","parksiet","23 October 2022","No, the hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the introduction of ""Black Adam"". This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn't take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it's a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn't stop... it's a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It's only problem - it's so average; something we've seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn't great, frankly. But it's still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!So let's get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a ""twist"" near the middle of the film. It's not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who've seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn't try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it's more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to ""The Suicide Squad"" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say ""see look how brutal we can make this"" without actually earning the audience's investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with ""look how powerful and ruthless he is"". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!It's when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that's okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I'd love to see this iteration of the character return. I'm just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson's physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn't here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn't like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad"" and of course a certain cast member from ""Shazam!"". I did love these little connections- it's nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the ""Shazam!"" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It's definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn't stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder's ""300"", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don't even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn't discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn't memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that's okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It's remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- ""Avatar"", ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like ""Venom""... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson's ""Black Adam"", especially in a potential ""Black Adam v. Superman"" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!","6/10"

DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of ""who is really a hero?"" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!","7/10"
"Black Adam","AvionPrince16","19 October 2022","What a movie! The special effects are really immersive and really give an immersion to the city Kahndag. We learn more about his story and the way that the whole habitants become slave. Black Adam have a story that become more and more interesting and give some surprises, revelations and a new orientation for the future of Black Adam ( with superman at the end). All the super heroes were awesome to watch by their suit, their powers, their goals and the confrontation between the justice society of America and Black Adam give some interesting theme to talk about: is Black Adam really a vilain? What is a hero? What is his duty? A hero can call himself a hero if he can free their people from slavery even he did bad actions? Where is really the line between vilain and superhero? I mean there were interesting things to talk about and the plot get more and more interesting even if its begin in a classic way: the curse of the wizards to make Black Adam a prisonner and his story have a lot of subtilities when other point of view will discuss about the Black Adam Story and his real intentions (his anger cant be under control and can become a treat but the real vilain who is Ishmael because its a descendant of the ancient king of Khandag and it will tell an other point of view about Black Adam because he saw him cried about a boy who get killed and its in fact was his boy who give him the power. So i mean there was some interesting revelations and surprises and bring more nuances to that Black Adam's character. And all the fights in the movie were pretty great and pretty epic. The justice society and their heroes were great ( special mention to Atom, DR Fate, Hawkman) and with them they will discuss more about what is an hero and how to act like one and not just said an hero its this and that make you an hero: it have more subtility and i really appreciated even if i didnt go watch Black Adam mainly for his story but i appreciate it anyway. It have also some drama moments with DR Fate and Hawkman but Dr Fate will save the world at the cost of his life and give an interesting view that DR Fate's character and give another interest to watch the movie because it really have some surprises and revelations during the whole movie and have no break for us to take during 2 hours and thats a good thing. Im glad that the movie have some subtilities and make him more interesting and thats not a battle about to see who is stronger but just to test the value and their intentions and their motivations and really make them stand out each of them and give interesting duels in spirit and physical (Hawkman and Black Adam).And at the end, maybe a collaboration with Black Adam and Superman? Or a duel? Very good DC Movie and bring a new world in an existed one (Shazam) but give an identity and a story to an hero/vilain character that will make him interesting to watch in next movies.","8/10"
"Black Adam","Nob0dy","9 November 2022","""The film initially received an R rating due to several gruesome death scenes and many cuts had to be made to the film to receive the lower PG-13 rating""^ That is all you need to know about this movie. A team of executives, producers, writers a director, an entire team of absurdly over paid people pitched an idea for a movie based on a comic character.They then hired writers to take certain elements and plot lines from the characters long history and make a movie out of it.They then hired directors, the highest paid yet most one dimensional ""actor"" in history to front it.They spent months having re-writes and changes. Spent months filming scenes over and over again. When they were happy with it it was sent to post production where a team of very highly paid people plastered the movie in special effects.They had it in a studio for weeks to months with music being composed, overlayed, sound lines being re-recorded, foley's producing sounds for movements and atmosphere. Then all of the audio was mixed and overlayed in a way they were happy withAnd then what happened? They took a finished product that they were content was a good vehicle to tell the story and completely buthcered it. Removed any scene that had the character acting like the character he is supposed to be, removed any and all scenes that could possibly be deemed as ""too much"" for a child by the ridiculous american MPAA. They watered down and hacked chunks out of their own product to sell more tickets, even though it was already guaranteed to be a financial success since it has the rocks name attached to it. They destroyed a story that they themselves had concocted and the end result is a completely different end product than what was pitched and even different from what was originally filmed it's dumb it is completely and utterly moronic. If you don't want to make an R rated movie and want to make yet another generic child focused brightly coloured, pun filled movie that has about as much depth as an episode of peppa the pig then do that. Don't take a character who historically has had stories revolving around adult themes, shoot an entire movie retaining the essence of the character and then proceeding to intentionally destroy any semblence of that character or the themes you were part of creating in the first place.I don't care for the rock personally, zero acting ability and a selfish attention seeker in real life, but this movie could and should've been good, he can't act at all but he already has the ego and arrogance that could fit this character, instead we get the most generic, predictable and low effort childish movie that DC has ever churned out.","1/10"
"Black Adam","winak","16 November 2022","This movie is solely for kids and teens, the rest of us would find the characters, dialogues and concept cheesy at best. With the more established super heroes there is a margin of believability we would like to have. Here with Black Adam it is like fantasy gone wild and so you never connect with these heroes and their ridiculous powers. Sole dependance on CGI to make a movie is not a great strategy. Dwayne, besides displaying his bulk there wasn't much to like about the Black Adam. I don't know how Pierce Brosnan got roped in, but he looked as out of place as Jim Carrey would look in an action movie. It was almost like he was there as a spoof to all superheroes. While the Atom Smasher guy's uniform looked almost identical to Deadpool and his growing into a giant looks just like what Antman does. Feel sorry for DC as they are desperately trying to compete with Marvel and losing terribly. I don't see this movie growing into a franchise as Dwayne Johnson would lose all credibility as an action hero if he continues with this drivel.","4/10"
"Black Adam","johnspringer-95440","15 February 2023","Black Adam is so formulaic and predictable that even the gigantic action spectacle becomes tedious before the end of the first act. The mostly no-name characters are cardboard cutouts of the supporting cast of every superhero film in the last 10 years. There's wise mentor old guy, team leader conflicted about following orders guy, overpowered youngster learning to harness her abilities girl, and AntMan - er, comedy relief can turn gigantic guy. There's generic bad dude bent on world domination, of course, plus sassy damsel, her precocious kid and secondary comedy-relief brother. As for Black Adam himself, there's a hint of an interesting story but it (along with any semblance of a plot) gets quickly buried and then easily resolved to make way for pointless action. And I do mean pointless, as in people with no reason and/or capacity to injure one another punching each other through buildings for an hour. Is this a terrible or hateful movie? No. It's just not very interesting or entertaining.","4/10"
"Black Adam","Zac_La_Porte","9 November 2022","Black Adam feels like a Marvel movie, except it cares more about how ""cool"" its CGI and action is, which gets in the way of a properly thought-out story and sufficient entertainment. To sum this movie up in one (or two) simple words, it's just completely pointless. Have movie celebrities, actors, directors, writers, producers and storytellers all lost their motivation for big comic book characters that fans actually care about? If they can't come up with good ideas and an actual plot, they may as well just dump the whole project instead of providing people with disappointingly boring action.It's completely undeniable that Black Adam is a blockbuster, considering the nearly $200 million budget and the very well-constructed, fast at times action. Despite excellent costume design for the main superheroes in this movie, as well as the cinematically awesome sound effects and visual work put into the action sequences, this is an incredibly flat, pointless and majorly boring action flick that wastes it cast's potential, opportunity and money. If you care about thematic aspects, Black Adam does take a few breaks to discuss the meanings of being a hero and being a villain, but that's really about it.Story-wise, there's nothing to say or talk about, because there's absolutely no thought for what the film is meant to be about. Again, the fantasy action is done almost impeccably, but it's ruined by the fact that since it has no plot or character development to fill in the gaps, there's flat dialogue and even more action to just pile it up into a long borefest of a mess. The entire thing is convoluted and you can feel every minute of it... Well, at least until the final third where you can feel every millisecond of it.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","3/10"
"Black Adam","dmerette","22 October 2022","I had such high hopes and I always enjoy The Rocks movies. But, I should have asked for nachos as cheesy as this movie ended up being. When they said ""Shazam!"" I cringed, that ruined the whole tone of the movie for me. The whole levitating thing got on my nerves too, I think Adam sat down once. I just didn't understand the need to levitate so much. The kid with the skateboard was cookie cutter Disney silly, trying to be funny and not, he just got on my nerves. This movie just ended up being silly and I couldn't wait for it to end. The whole super hero movie has to stop, its just too much and getting old. The whole tone was all wrong.

Why would Dwayne get himself in such an uniteresting mess!I expected Sarah Shahi to do much better. Rather she turned out to be one of the major excellence inhibitors in the movieI know, I know. Many dudes here will rate this review as unuseful. Fine, I understand where you come from. Many youngsters enjoy style so much that they loose interest in quality substance.

"Black Adam","kevin_robbins","22 October 2022","Black Adam (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. This storyline follows an ancient being known as Black Adam awaken within some ancient ruins. There is a race to find a historical crown that contains demon powers that is tied to how Black Adam gained his powers. As Black Adam's chaos begins he gains the attention of the Justice Society that will try to contain Black Adam while also thwarted the evil doers trying to get the crown. The question becomes which side will Black Adam take, the side of the evil doers or join forces with the Justice Society?This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (The Rundown), Aldis Hodge (Hidden Figures), Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Mohammed Amer (Mo).It's impossible not to like a super hero movie with this many kill scenes. The Rock is absolutely awesome as Black Adam and his kill scenes are tremendous as are the running jokes tied to the killings. The comedic content overall is pretty solid. The special effects are tremendous and I enjoyed the inclusion of the Justice Society. Aldis Hodge delivers a strong performance as does Jalon Christian (A Journal for Jordan). The storyline is intricate and has some fun twists and turns and I enjoyed the conclusion. The post credits scenes is absolutely awesome too.Overall, this is a very well done addition to the super hero genre with enough unique elements to make it a must see. I would score this a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.","8/10"
"Black Adam","coco12345","30 December 2022","Pierce Brosnan is completely wasted in this role but damn, he looks good! My stars all go to this luscious man.Other than that expect the usual Rock schtick: one-dimensional acting, misplaced comic relief, blah blah blah.I didn't know anything about the characters or the story before I watched and can say I still don't know much. I don't know where the Justice League came from or why. Are they the good guys? I don't know. Is Black Adam is a good guy or a bad guy? Beats me. I get that it doesn't have to be black/white, good/bad. But I should have some sense of these character's motivations and goals and purpose but I have none. Zero, zip. Which means I couldn't care less about any of them.Except Pierce, lol.","3/10"
"Black Adam","rtbradford","29 October 2022","I was looking forward to this flick, but it was simply awful. If you've seen the clips, you've seen all the best parts of the movie. I wasn't looking for Oscar quality, but at least some semblance of a plot. And I've read plenty of comic books in my day, so I know what a decent comic book plot is like.Visually, the movie was almost entirely CGI and it wasn't the best CGI either. The Rock basically did a few scenes where he showed an angry facial expression and the rest was CGI. And the story, if you can call it that, was sloppy. For example, how does a long dead guy in what I assume is somewhere in the Middle East get resurrected speaking perfect American English? And why does the Justice Society just attack him without finding out his story?The movie was so bad even my 13 year old son left the theater saying it was one of the worst movies he's ever seen. Hawkman was the one redeeming aspect of the movie. It was nice to see him introduced to the DC cinematic universe.If you want to see it, best to wait until it comes out to stream at home for a few bucks.","3/10"
"Black Adam","ScreenGenius","3 February 2023","Black Adam is steadfastly average for a superhero/supervillain movie. There were many places where the story was obviously weak due to lazy writing, which contributed to an overall plot that was predictable and boring. Some scenes were downright goofy and cringe. The fight scenes were actually decent and the final fight scene better. But as a villain origin story compared to the hero origin story Man of Steel, this movie was a miss.The Rock portrayed Black Adam adequately, but I don't think this role really suits him. He is best as the comedic hero that everyone is rooting for. Black Adam is a darker villain, so his acting style doesn't really align. That said, he did do a decent job, but by comparison to its closest counterpart, Man of Steel, this movie just felt like a lesser experience.","4/10"
"Black Adam","FeastMode","20 October 2022","I knew nothing of Black Adam going in so it was pretty cool to discover who he is and what he's about. This is a fast-paced and fun movie with some good action scenes. The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/20/2022)","6/10"

But it doesn't try to be that either.It was fun, enjoyable, fights where amazing, soundtrack was great, just a well-made hero movie where you can see superhumans dish out in fight!And considering the quality of the MCU we have received recently, I would definitely recommend this one to avid super hero fans!","8/10"
"Black Adam","georgewilliamnoble","25 October 2022","Since around late 2019, I have boycotted all superhero movies all that noise all that endless repetitive fighting that achieves little. However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie.","3/10"
"Black Adam","Batsy1501","19 October 2022","I think the movie was fine. Actually, it was pretty messy in a lot of ways. The villain was quite lacking in depth, and the pacing was too fast, making some scenes quite chaotic. The characters' development was okay for Black Adam and the JSA, but the boy that has a pretty large amount of screentime couldn't make me care about him, and I couldn't even remember his name. But just for the sound and visual aspects, Black Adam was completely worth enjoying; it was a visual and aural feast. The CGI battles were pretty insane, but also overwhelming sometimes. Overall, a 7 for me. Although Superman's appearance was fantastic, I think killing off Kent Nelson was a bad choice because he was definitely the highlight of the JSA team.","6/10"
"Black Adam","MrDHWong","20 October 2022","""Black Adam"" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019's ""Shazam!"". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam's rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character's sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical ""with great power comes great responsibility"" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.I have to admit it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he's going to pick and choose.To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there's extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It's just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.As the film is a spin-off from ""Shazam!"", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there's also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn't always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.It seems long overdue that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It's great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn't consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That's not to say he's always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate's comic debut predates Strange's creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn't have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there's any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like ""Black Adam"" doesn't really offer anything better or worse than what we've already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from ""Shazam!"", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.I rate it 7.5/10.","8/10"
"Black Adam","ACollegeStudent","16 March 2023","Rating: 4.0Interesting ideas decent effects but poor narrative execution. Finally a ""hero"" who doesn't care about killing people and has a good reason for his mindset his son a true hero died to save him making him feel unworthy of the legend that precipitated as he continues through his path of anger and mourning. The inversion of the motif life is the only path to death being used as the literal way the antagonist gains his powers was clever and the presentation was decent for the most part. The problem is the weak side characters: Adrianna is one-dimensional (only about her son), her son is a MacGuffin in the second half, atom smasher is bland comedy relief etc. There were nonsensical action scenes ex: Black Adam fighting guards with a literal tube down his throat when the guards can just shoot him. Black Adam going to save Adrianna's son then abandoning him at his house to fight enemies when he literally could've just taken him when he found him preventing his kidnapping. Also adam drowning then somehow rising to the surface so he could say shazam. And preachy dialogue: all of Adrianna's monologues about teamwork and oppression were cringe and forced. Same with her son. It just felt like fanfiction in areas from the action to the dialogue to the worldbuilding (eternium? Seriously?).","4/10"

It's the lack of humor in the dialog. There's no witty one liners to amuse you as the action plays out. It takes 43 minutes until there is a superhero fight which is very boring. They take all this time to get to the point. Then it takes off into endlessly pointless fights for an hour plus. I just found the movie really tedious to sit through.

"Black Adam","subxerogravity","22 October 2022","Man! How long have I've been waiting to see this movie? I feel like The Rock has been talking about wanting to play the character since 2006. I always wondered why Black Adam? Not just an obscure Comic book character amongst DC's finest but why not just play his best rival SHAZAM and truly be a black superhero?I have to say, I'm so happy he picked Black Adam. Mostly because Dwayne Johnson playing a ""Villain"" met that superheroes would have to try to stop him, and they made the decision to...extend the DC Extended Universe with heroes that have not grace the silver screen yet.Aldis Hodge playing a cross between Batman and Black Panther with his version of Hawkman. The special effects to bring Atom Smasher to life were amazing, now I know who Cyclone is (I wonder if she's an actual black woman in the comic), and Pierce Brosnan, who could have been my generation's Batman, is playing Dr. Faith. Forming together to become the Justice Society and me hoping this will not be the last I see of them.Black Adam was good it was really good, absolutely worth the time and effort. The DC Extended universe has made some questionable movies, but this is not one of them. This was Aquaman, Wonder Woman good. This was SHAZAM good, and that's hope that battle with Black Adam is coming up!Excellent!!","8/10"

"Black Adam","Top_Dawg_Critic","4 November 2022","I will admit I had my doubts casting Johnson, but he nailed it so well, I actually wanted more of him. He needed more dialogue, and less cheesy attempts at humor from everyone else. The story conceptually was well played out, but none of the three (inexperienced superhero) writers had the creativity to elevate the story past the predicable, muddled, cliched antics, and attempts at humor - which was hit and miss. I laughed out loud here and there, but cringed and groaned at some of the infantile humor and dialogue. The other issue was director Jaume Collet-Serra's constant slow-mo shots; some I could understand were needed, but others were just too much and felt amateurish. The convoluted exposition, overblown CGI and overbearing score didn't do the film any justice either. This film could've been great in the hands of better filmmakers. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it more than expected, and I feel the critics went too hard on this one. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.","8/10"
"Black Adam","DarthWalker-34381","29 December 2022","I wanted Black Adam to be good. I really did. It was described by the Rock as ""Superman who kills the bad guys"". So, when it came to HBO Max, I couldn't wait to see it.Well, the only thing that was good about this movie was the cool action sequences, state of the art CGI and a big-budget ending.Beyond that, Black Adam was just plain bad....poorly written, full of stale one-liners and sloppy direction. And the acting...well, that wasn't great, either, but that's about what you would expect with such bad material. Dwayne Johnson, who normally delivers a charismatic performance with natural comedic timing, might have been going for a dark brooding dark knight like character but instead came off as mostly wooden and boring. Definitely the worst DC movie since Green Lantern. A huge disappointment.","5/10"
"Black Adam","Ra1nguy","19 October 2022","Black Adam is the latest film in the DCEU, and boy, it packs a punch. Explosions, flying superheroes, magic, lightning and beautiful armour follows the Justice Society, and of course Black Adam.The film centers around a god-like ancient human being who was gifted his powers in a time of darkness and enslavement. After being defeated and unseen for over a 5000 years, he returns, his goal being unknown. With the powers he has a group of superheroes, the Justice Society, deems him to be a threat, and performs an attempt to lock him up, unknown of the real danger.It is better than people say. Although at first glance it seems to be a film simply made for the action and explosions, it does have a story, strong dialogues and character development. The visual effects are astonishing in every single way, and people who have watched Avengers: Endgame will love the visuals in this film.My personal rating? A 10/10. My rating based on realism, plot and other factors? An 8 or a 9/10. If I'm going to be honest, the worst thing about this film was some unrealism like characters being able to survive a lot more than possible, and some being quite dumb in terms of their actions.As for my conclusion: Black Adam is a great, visually wonderful film with lots of action violence and lovable characters. Watch it in the cinema for a lifetime experience.","7/10"
"Black Adam","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","19 October 2022","After being trapped for nearly 5000 years, Adam(Johnson, strangely dialing his famous charisma down to zero for most of his screen time, and all in the present day) is released and clashes with the Justice Society of America over whether or not it is ok to use lethal force when fighting oppressors.This feels like multiple movies awkwardly glued together. The opening could easily have been extended into feature length, but they didn't want to spend that long in ancient times, so instead it is a massive(necessary, yes, still, could have been trimmed down) infodump. At times this is very gritty and dark. Then others, it is franchise friendly: quippy, breezy, let's bring in some young heroes that can keep appearing for years to come. Remind me, where are the JL in all of this? Casting couch?The reason that the titular character of this did not appear in the first Shazam movie(and it looks very unlikely he will be in the second one, either, except maybe as a sequel-baity mid or post credits scene) was said to be so they could have enough time to properly explore his character, however, it would have made more sense for this to feature Billy Batson or Superman instead of the JSA.The action is fun. Occasionally, it does forget that it is essentially nothing other than meaningless flash, except for when human beings who are not invulnerable, do not have immense superpowers, are put in danger: those fighting against their occupiers, such as Adrianna(Shahi, empathetic, strong) and her son Amon(Sabongui, passionate).This features some brutal violence. I recommend this to fans of the characters and of bombastic blockbusters. 7/10.","7/10"
"Black Adam","AfricanBro","21 October 2022","Admittedly far from impressive, doesn't reinvent the wheel and writing wasn't so great, but I loved it still. My feelings kept changing before it's release, compared to the days I was excited for it, it didn't deliver as much, but if compared to the days I was scared it was gonna flop then Black Adam was actually way better than my expectations.The first scenes of the movie are great, sorta reminds me of mythical movies like clash of the titans or Hercules in which Dwayne Johnson featured in too. Not many movies like that being made, we went from gladiator movies to Greek god movies, somewhere in between had Egyptian mummies and now we're in a superhero phase. Still think superhero movies are awesome fun, even better when done right but I loved gods and mythical movies, and this puts them both together.It has an almost dark ambience to it but is still visually stunning with Cyclone and Atom smasher giving it a more prismatic feel. They also had a little side plot going that actually didn't get anywhere. Compared to other recent movies, I love that Black Adam's origin was handled in a God Butcher-esque way, it was dark enough to still keep it dark while still keeping a pg13 rating which I thought should've been higher before release.It also blends Black Adam's Bronze Age origins and magic with future tech. If you're more of a fan of the cinematic universes and don't really read the comics, the movie does it's best to give you a background introduction, but because of this the first part of the movie feels rushed because it's a lot to condense into the start. Don't really read the comics so I don't know if they did Black Adam's character justice for the comic fans.Adams intro in the movie so good, and his main adversary's was even better later on, actually devilish. I love how when DC super-powers someone, they really go for it and people really hated it with Henry Cavil's Superman. I love the idea of them potentially getting into a brawl in the future.Action is superb once it starts, delivers on expectations although the movie almost leans a lot on it's action. I also recommend avoiding spoilers and trailers as I did. Loved how Black Adam's sternness is written to some comedic effect at times, I often say Hollywood shouldn't try making every new superhero movie into a joke show and they kept it in a low here.Dwayne Johnson was great and did his character justice, so did Pierce Brosnan as Dr fate, I think Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell suffered from being underwritten side characters due to so much plot and other characters the movie had to fit in, so they didn't get as much time to shine. If there was an award for most cameos in the same movie... I also feel like black Adam was written perfectly but at the end started making mannerisms that broke from his character, like the smirking and smiles.The actual problems I had with the movie were once the premise is revealed the story progresses generically, so you can pretty much figure out where the story is going. It's pretty formulaic and the story narration wasn't something to behold. For that reason, as much as I still love it, it's not as good as it could've been, it does deliver on shifting the power dynamics in the dceu though. And with all the great action and cast coupled with decent story, it's still a fun watch. Secondly, something I rarely say, it could've been better if it was longer to let the story develop and add depth; because it has the makings of a great movie and really finds it's footing in the third act but then blitzes quickly through it to the end.And it promises a lot for the future, I hope future DC movies are more coherent like what MCU does by making their movies relate, not just having heroes cameoing in other heroes movies then bunching them all together. This could be a great start to a phase in the DC universe, could argue it started with Shazam but you get it.It's imperfect and has wiggle room for improvement but I love it and would recommend seeing it on the big screen. Deadpool has been my favorite antihero for a long time and is a whole different character but I think black Adam's taking that spot now. I loved the movie for Black Adam's character himself.","8/10"
"Black Adam","ronaldfury","19 October 2022","Just finished watching black adam. Cgi is so good and visual effects are flawless. Fights scenes are brutal and fun to watch. Action packed from start to finish. Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal and the justice society of America makes it more fun and interesting(except cyclone). Hawkman,Black Adam are the badass in this film. Dwayne Johnson is really born to play this character and watch out for the mid credit scene!.This is the movie for a great momentum for the future of DC universe.At the negative side, villain is not intimidating and storyline is repetitive and there some cheesy scenes but overall this movie is a blast.So excited for the future of dceu. 7.5/10.","3/10"
"Black Adam","allen_pagent","24 November 2022","Far too many action movies are released that follow the same theme: two minutes of insipid dialog followed by 15 minutes of CGI that we've seen many times before, then repeat the whole thing all over again. The art of telling a great story is quickly heading toward extinction. Black Adam is a perfect example. The first task in character development. Why should we care about this person? None of the characters in this movie give you a reason to care about them. Even the villains are empty. No pressing reason to hate them. As I watched the move I was wondering why The Rock signed on. I mean aside from the obvious paycheck, the only challenge was perhaps working on some facial expressions. I hope Hollywood gives this character a quick death and doesn't pursue a sequel.","4/10"
"Black Adam","unsure-1","22 October 2022","There is little originality in this. No surprises. A few cringe moments. In other words, a typical Rock vehicle. Super-jarring to see any other parts of the universe stitched in as if they're supposed to fit (they don't). New characters introduced like we're supposed to know and love them already. The same Snyder-esque template (endless slow mo, dirty/dark palette). Dr. Fate copies literally every move from Dr. Strange. Hawkman annoying as hell with his bland brand of ""leadership"". And the villain, oh the villain...It's like they used one of the new AI tools to auto-generate everything in this movie. It's as entertaining as masturbation. If that's your thing, cool.","4/10"
"Black Adam","IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews","16 November 2022","Honestly, large parts of BLACK ADAM seem like they are cinematics from a hypothetical INJUSTICE game. Rubbery, bad CGI in fights with some cool moments. And it's all fine - until you realize that you don't have a controller in your hands.BLACK ADAM tries to be a darker anti-hero story, but it only succeeds in displaying lots of money being burnt on screen. A cheesy script with cheesy direction and cheesy acting and a very bad score - desperately trying to get your attention with cheesy CGI.Now, there's some nice and cool moments in this, but unfortunately, they don't make up for the horribly bad moments. Just think about an ancient culture, maybe even the oldest one on this planet - and they had some guy with a goofy lightning logo on his chest as their ""champion"". Right.Add a very generic score with insufferable ""beats"", and you get a cheese show deluxe.If anything, the fight between this strangely generic ""Hawkman"" and Black Adam in the kid's room was pretty fun, plus some shots and maybe even some lines in between, but as a whole, this is pretty much a mess from beginning to end - a convoluted two hours that won't really satisfy you. Too many bad lines, bad moments, bad plot points, bad characters and bad visuals that will spoil the fun. The concept is intriguing, though, and I would have loved to see a better script turned into reality by a way better director. Oh well.","9/10"
"Black Adam","stevendbeard","22 October 2022","I saw Black Adam, starring Dwayne Johnson-Young Rock_tv, Baywatch_2017; Aldis Hodge-What Men Want, Leverage_tv; Sarah Shahi-Person of Interest_tv, Alias_tv and Pierce Brosnan-The Son_tv, the Mamma Mia! Movies.This is a comic book movie based on the books created by C. C. Beck. Black Adam started out as a villain for Captain Marvel-now known as Shazam because of Marvel's legal rights-but is now more of an anti hero, even becoming a member of the JLA in the comics. Anyway, Dwayne plays Teth_Adam, a slave some 5,000 years ago that gained powers similar to Captain Marvel/Shazam by Egyptian Gods by saying the magic word, Shazam. He is entombed after a fight against a villainous King and then released in the present by Sarah, a native of Kahndaq where Dwayne calls home. Sarah persuades Dwayne to help rid Kahndaq of Intergang, a criminal element that is taking over their country and notice of Dwayne's activities reach the USA. The JSA-Justice Society of America, an early version of the JLA-are called in to subdue Dwayne. Good luck with that. Pierce is Dr Fate and Aldis is Hawkman and they bring a couple of trainees, Cyclone and Atomsmasher. There is a nice cameo for Atomsmasher's father. The fights are pretty good and Dwayne, who was made for this role, really doesn't like to take prisoners. There is a scene just after the end credits start but nothing at the very end.It's rated PG-13 for strong violence, intense action and some language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.I really liked this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","1/10"
"Black Adam","danielwilianto","19 November 2022","This movie shows that DC should really stop making movies. It's hilariously bad on many level. Also they shouldn't have casted Dwayne Johnson. That guy is obviously still Dwayne no matter what role he is in.Why would Black Adam throw jokes such as, ""I waited for you before dropping those bad guys"" or ""The man in black said Hi?"" This guy was supposed to living a hellish live of a slave his whole life. And it should still feel like yesterday that he lost his child and wife. Why would he listen to a dumb suggestion made by a teenager?Also a fat man with leg problem and a skinny mom can beat up a lot of skeleton soldiers from hell? A squad of soldiers can take all of them even easier then. How come the world is in crisis?The main demon is admittedly stronger, but a punch from Superman will send him back to hell in an instant. Also, why did the whole world become nervous from this incident? Did they forget the existence of Justice League? Oh wait, why did our old magician contact and free Dwayne John instead of contacting Superman?Bad bad movie.","5/10"
"Black Adam","benjaminskylerhill","21 October 2022","Director Juame Collet-Serra's extensive experience helming thriller films is quite evident here; the action-while not particularly distinctive-is more than sufficiently hard-hitting, gleefully destructive, and thrilling to keep the film from ever becoming dull.That's quite the achievement, because on paper Black Adam is a largely dull exercise. It's entirely derivative of other, better superhero films, and is without an ounce of any sense of originality in what it delivers to this corpse of a genre.The film has a villain who is never really introduced until the final act and is laughably cartoonish. He's a punching bag for the characters to have something to fight at the end of the movie.The ordinary mortal characters are just as lifeless. Most of the people in this movie aren't actual living, breathing human beings, but plot devices.That being said, The Rock's titular character of Black Adam is actually handled surprisingly well. His background of tragedy is thoroughly explored (even though it's through clunky narration exposition dumps), and does undergo tangible internal change over the course of the story.Adam's change in self-image has moderately thought-provoking implications as he comes to realise that his past failures don't determine currency worthiness.This is one of only two bright spots in the writing, along with watching Adam and Hawkman clash in their worldviews/opinions of justice.I really do wish that these bright spots made up more of the movie. Because the entire plot is constructed solely of story beats and objects and antagonists who have not only been seen before, but have been seen before so often-and exactly in this way-that they've been beaten more than any deceased horse.Consequently, it's a sometimes charming, largely competent exercise in rote rehash.","1/10"
"Black Adam","cdcrb","24 October 2022","Not for nothing, but shouldn't a movie have some kind of story to tell. If there is a story here, i missed it. There is something about an ancient crown, but other than that, you got me. Dwayne is just fine as as an ""action"" hero and there is lots going on. Explosions and stuff. But nothing makes any sense and the film commits the greatest crime-its boring. It keeps repeating the same thing over and over. You mind goes numb watching people being thrown hither and yon. It actually starts out pretty good, but once the rock appears it seems to lose its way. I'm sure it will be a big success, but not because its worth seeing. Sorry.","6/10"
"Black Adam","jack_o_hasanov_imdb","26 October 2022","What did you expect from this movie?I found what I was waiting for. I mean, I was expecting a fun movie that wasn't strong, had great effects, and had good / ok acting. The movie was such a movie. I think the effects were very good. Acting was ok. The Rock was a perfect fit for the role. Frankly, I found the script weak. So obviously there were some good lines and ideas in the movie, but they couldn't fill it. It could have been a good story, a questioning movie, but it didn't. The ending of the movie was very predictable and it ended exactly as I expected. After credit was good. The slow-montion action scenes were good in the beginning, but then they became too repetitive. In general, I liked it, but also did not like it. But i don't think this movie is bad.","1/10"

But it's a sorry excuse if trying to make a funny and ""dark"" marvel movie. The plot is so illogical. The black Adam plot is good and they've could have done it with that alone. But they had to put in 4 ridiculous heroes that comes in and tries to save the day and that's an opportunity to make a cheap political correct point: ""you never cared about this country but now that we have our own hero you want to help and regulate us""Stupid...They spend the whole movie building black Adam as a charachter that is to strong for his own good and after destroying a whole city that still cheers for Adam... he all of a sudden realizes that his to dangerous and gives up his powers to be closed in to a maximum security facility deep under the Arctic Ocean to be stored in cryo for all eternity and it feels like the movie is ending and we could get a prequel to a movie where NOTHING happened. But no... the bad guy lives and looks now like hellboy and now wants to destroy the whole city where he wanted to be king... look and behold, black Adam rises from his cryo as a mere human and with bare hands he kicks the shenanigan out of 6 elite guards (who has 6 guards in a maximum security facility?!?!) and then swims out to almost die, daydream a bit while the devil himself kicks the shenanigans out of our other useless heroes... then says Shazam and then is in game again.Meanwhile the little boy who taught our main charachter all about morality and chivalry in under 8 hours now decides to take it in his own hands to gather the city and unite it against their enemy of living dead soldiers by standing on a stone and in a pathetic way say: come on, this is what we've been waiting for"" the citizens then realize ""yes this is what we've been waiting for! To fight a living dead hord with our bare hands, yes! Let's do it!"" So led by a 15 year old boy who in the next scen has taken the time to find a skateboard to carry him victoriously into the next scene, we se old ladies and regular citizens now beat the butt out of the living dead summoned from hell...I was in agony... I'm so sorry they did this to you Dwayne... you deserved better.","1/10"

"Black Adam","Sleepin_Dragon","1 August 2023","Black Adam is freed from his Earthly tomb after 5000 years, full of anger and rage, Earth isn't perhaps quite ready for Adam's presence, nor are the local Superheroes.I'm basing my review after a second viewing. I originally saw it in the cinema upon its release, it was met with a plethora of groans and sighs, second time round, I watched with some close friends, some real Marvel addicts, all of whom didn't rate it.First time round, I honestly thought it was a spoof, I thought it was sending up Marvel's early years, how sad to release this was no spoof.The main issue for me, the absolute absence of any plot, there just isn't any significant, basic storyline, it's just a sequence of messy, random events.There's an old saying, called a mug's eyeful, basically meaning that there's so much going on in front of you, too much, and that is very much the case here, this is a CGI monstrosity, way too many effects. This however is a mug's brainful, the music is overpowering, the effects are too relentless, it aimlessly crashes from one scene to the next.If I was forced to highlight a positive, I would say that Dwayne Johnson was way too good for the abysmal script he was working with, he adds a sincerity and gravitas that the film almost doesn't deserve, what a waste of his talents.If your only interest is CGI special effects, you'll find something here, otherwise, you'll be left totally unimpressed.Shockingly bad.4/10.","5/10"
"Black Adam","isaacsundaralingam","22 October 2022","Was anybody really excited about Black Adam? Maybe there are people who were, but as for myself and the people I know, Black Adam was just yet another superhero movie in an unending line of superhero movies; all the same with nothing new or fresh to offer. But still, as is custom, I had to go check this movie out because Sri Lanka's roster of theater releases aren't that great, so I'll take whatever comes.Black Adam ended up being sometimes funny, a little more than sometimes cringe, and extremely mid. It's a movie with the most generic stakes ever, and with nothing new to add to a genre that has been the same for the past few years. The only aspect I personally enjoyed in the movie was Pierce Brosnan, and sometimes The Rock, but everything else fell flat. Especially whatever the writers tried to do with the Amon character. Things couldn't have been more generic than that.Overall, is it a bad movie? Far from it. Is it good? NO. Should you watch it? Well, you wouldn't be missing anything if you didn't.","2/10"
"Black Adam","simonwoodwrites","4 January 2023","Sadly, this is a trainwreck of a movie that set itself up for failure. The story is where most of this goes wrong. It needed a lot of streamlining and simplification. There is so much detail trying to be crammed in here that it is cluttered but at the same time, vague. A few issues I had. Who was the bad guy and what was Black Adam's objective? There are these mercenaries that run the country and for the longest time we don't who is running it and no one seems to be interested in getting rid of them by the end. There is so much backstory and it keeps being revised throughout the movie. The hero vs villain dynamic is a mess. Black Adam seems to be against everyone--Justice Society, the mercs and anyone in his way. So the story doesn't have any direction or focus. There's a problem with the characters. The Justice Society is such a poor relation to the Justice League and Suicide Squad why bother. Their abilities did nothing. Black Adam himself, yes, he's antihero but his behavior was baffling. This guy did more damage to his country and its infrastructure than anyone that it's baffling why they were cheering for him. Oh, and stop floating and busting through walls. The tone is off. It bounces from R-rated to wanting to play to kids with a kid sidekick. Sadly, it's another superhero movie CGI overload. It never looks good compared to actual locations and practical effects. Finally, like spies in spy movies, Superheroes shouldn't talk about themselves as heroes.I could keep going on about the issues with this movie but I don't have the energy. Overall, is it the worst superhero movie ever made, no. Is it's clumsiest ever conceived? Yep.","6/10"
"Black Adam","Jithindurden","20 October 2022","Amid all the negative reviews and expectations of a The Rock movie, this was precisely what I expected. A simple entertaining film if you're able to see past some of its obvious faults. The action really felt like it was trying to be Zack Snyder lite, which partially works because it only tries to be lite in using that style even though the movie itself is action-packed. The characters are very forgettable although the performances of Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge and the rest of the Justice Society members gives some life to it. The music was very underwhelming for me especially because it tries to elevate scenes by becoming loud and noticeable without making any impact.Black Adam is supposed to be an antihero but with a star like The Rock, he is only a reluctant hero who doesn't mind killing. Overall just a watchable film if you're a fan of the superhero genre.","4/10"

The Rock played it straight instead of with his recently usual cartoonishness.This isn't the same, goofy Dwayne Johnson from ""Jumanji"" or ""Jungle Cruise"" as he plays it much darker and with seriousness. While not a technical masterpiece, ""Black Adam"" delivers where it counts the most - in terms of pure enjoyment! It is a thrilling popcorn flick through and through and should go down as one of the Rock's better films...The supporting cast was good, though they were a bit cookie-cutter and under developed as a whole. Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman could have used a bit more a background story as it was difficult to invest any emotion for them. It was as though they just appeared and we were just supposed to know their backstory. Aside from that, and the choppiness of the first 20 mins, it was an all out good watch...","10/10"

It was Eye Popping Stuff 👌DC is Strong with This One. This Movie Contains Some of the Greatest Battle Scenes of All time. MCU and DCU.I think The Rock has Produced one of, if not the Greatest Quote in a Superhero Movie of all time, MCU and DCU. Hawkman - Heroes Don't Kill People. Black Adam - ""Well I Do"".That Quote is Up there With ""I know what it's like to Lose, to feel so Desperately that you are Right, yet to Fail Nonetheless.........it's frightening, it turns the Legs to Jelly"". From ThanosThings I Liked -Quick Sidenote - I hear a lot of people saying Atom Smasher and Cyclone were Underutilized, I disagree. Those 2 were more like Accessories to the Main 3 which were Black Adam, Hawkman And Doctor Fate. So Those 2 Fulfilled their Roles.1. Firstly the Movie is So Much Fun.2. All of the Battle Scenes are Really Pinging the Top of the Meter Visually and Are Stunning on the Eye. I Love Stunning Energy Within the Slow Motion, the Choreography and Impact Sounds in the Battles.3. The Rock Produces a Strong Performance as Black Adam.4.

The Dynamic between the Justice Society, Black Adam, Sarah Shahi and the young Boy was Weak at First but then as time went on, the Chemistry grew and grew and I liked it.6.

But after the first fight scene, the movie turned into one big explosion. It was repetitive, shallow, and extremely boring. Obviously, a normal person can't produce such a movie.

"Black Adam","jessegehrig","14 February 2023","This is a review for the the Fire Emblem game, Fire Emblem Engage! Also this is a display of contempt for the movie I'm supposed to be reviewing. So the new Fire Emblem is pretty good. I don't think Fire Emblem Engage is better than Fire Emblem Three Houses, but that said I've been playing Fire Emblem Engage every day since it's release on January 20th. What I like about Fire Emblem games is the game play- I move all of my guys and the computer does nothing, then when my turn is over the computer moves all of its guys and I can do nothing. Some people might not like that aspect of powerlessness, cause you just have to wait and you can't do anything about what's happening, but I really appreciate the waiting because it gives me a chance to use the bathroom or like get something out of the fridge.","2/10"
"Black Adam","bolomark","3 January 2024","I wanted to like this movie but this movie BOMBED. Sure, lots of action alright provided you can get past the horrible CGI and people running in place. Lacks emotion and they crammed too much to make an action movie without much of a storyline and bland plot.The CGI is something that I couldn't get past. If I wanted to watch people run in place I would go to the gym. The kid did okay but the movie was really just explosions and destruction, and did I mention, IT'S ALL HORRIBLE CGI? Apologize but it's that bad.Pretty sad for Dwayne Johnson. They needed to have some humor in it. It seems like it's a 10 hour movie because of not having much of a storyline. Some action movies can be great is they have something, anything to go with it, you know, humor, drama, horror, anything but nope, just a monotone single emotion movie. This movie bombed bigtime.","7/10"
"Black Adam","Xstal","16 November 2022","There's a superhero rogue packed full of rage, he's been released, and then restored, from a dark cage, quite a sociopathic type, probably kill you in a fight, not sentimental, but quite unstable, has war to wage. Cyclone, Fate and Atom Smasher have a plan, to curtail Teth-Adam's rampage with Hawkman, temper all of his frustrations, to protect the world of nations, they just need to get his lips to say 'shazam'. Meanwhile Ishmael seeks to get the Crown of Sabbac, there's a role he fancies having, a big stab at, and there are those deep down below, quite keen that he has a go, and only one can take him on, our man in black.A more than satisfying two hours of hero, antihero, baddie brilliance.","4/10"

"Black Adam","vibhus-17780","20 October 2022","Rather than Action sequence , nothing shines . Black Adam is jus another rock movie with DCs super hero stuff . Average plot and poor effort from writers ( eventhough superhero movies contain same type of story , in this they just followed the usual template ) . Literally poor direction , most of place felt rushed , clumsy and incomplete . Action sequence was topnotch , with good choreography and marvelous visuals . Humor worked well in few places . More than Black Adam we can only see Dwayne Johnson . Comparing to others Doctor Fate was pretty impressive . Antagonist didn't create much impact . Cast done their job well . Technically , VFXs and cinematography were good , editing was average .Overall a jus watch it for action sequence and mid credit scene 🔥 , if you can digest some cringe .","2/10"
"Black Adam","nufc_geordie","5 February 2023","This movie looked amazing from the trailer... and I really like some of the cast!But, it's lack of engagement, poor script and lackluster story had me regretting the time and money I spent to see it.The main thread of the storyline is quite simple, but the convoluted way in which it is delivered had me baffled.The beginning of the movie is narrated, telling the viewers the origins of this made-up world and how the protagonist came to be. However when the movie starts its supposedly 5000 years later... but this modern world is unrecognizable except for the Superman & Batman iconography, which isn't subtle at all.The humour is forced and delivered deadpan, just as most of the dialog. The cast are either bored or receiving poor direction and the fight scenes are akin to a Tom & Jerry cartoon.The CGI is great though, which is its only saving grace!","5/10"

I knew a bit who black adam was but the rest i had no clue.There was no character development at all, who is Dr Fate, Hawkman, Atom crusher and Cyclone, someone who has never read any comics might be lost in this DC universe.I guess this movie is a real mess, the lead women in the pyramide released black adam real easy from is tomb (or has we learn later on is prison)That he was not a hero but is son gave him the powers, lots of villains with special weapons motorbikes flying but were did they come from.Its like the movie starts with a bang lots of action fighting explosions but you get nothing else.","7/10"
"Black Adam","pap-05900","19 October 2022","Black Adam is everything anyone hoped it was really. Its a fun and thrilling action packed superhero movie.Dwyane Jhonson plays a somewhat stoic antihero and is elevated by his cast mainly the actors for Hawkman and Dr Fate who are the standout in this movie. Though i would have liked to seen more of Atom Smasher and Cyclone because theyre barely in the movie. The mythos of Black Adam is something most people will find interestig as well. And the film does a good job of introducing new characters and places and overall expanding the DCEU.So did the heiracrchy in DC universe change? Well kinda. This film may be fun and pretty violent at times. And I can see it doing really well in the box office. The critics are most probably not gonna like this movie as it is a bit messy at times and the stoic performance by the ROCK may not be the cup of tea for everyone. But for an average joe who doesnt keep up with their daily cup of critical pretentiousness, and just wants to spend some time watching badass superheroes being badass. This is the film for you.Its no 'Batman Begins' but it never wants to be. Fun but flawed is the best description i can give it. I really enjoyed it. And most people will certainly do aswell.And also, stay for the post credits. You wont be disappointed.","2/10"
"Black Adam","arfdawg-1","24 December 2022","What did I just watch?Admittedly, I am unfamiliar with the DC comix Black Adam. Never heard of it, in fact. This film was supposed to be a companion piece to Shazzam, which in my view was a boring kid's movie.Black Adam doesnt know what it wants to be. Is it a super hero movie? An anti-hero movie? Or is it an Indiana Jones movie?In any case it's absurdly derivitive. Filled with the same types of characters as the Indiana flicks, but not as good. Further the CGI is horrible for a big budget movie and some ""human"" characters actually look like video game CGI renderings.They also try to insert those pop mucical interludes like Marvel movies, but fail miserably. In fact there are quite a few unintentional laffs in there because it's so cheesy.The Rock should stick to Jumangi sequels At least those are entertaining.Another huge disappointment from the DC universe.PS I dont even understand why this character was in the comics in the first place. How is he different from Superman?","6/10"

"Black Adam","nickpebody","29 October 2022","I came into this movie with high hopes with a good cast. The film was terrible. After 10 minutes I couldn't wait for it to finish. The plot was all over the place and DC have done what they always do, throw a ton of characters and plots and explosions in without really fully explaining any kind of back story.Dwayne Johnson I normally like, but he literally looked like he was reading off an autocue all the way through. The best character was Pierce Brosnan's but again because there was no explanation of any back story I can't even remember the characters name. Awful film. Wouldn't watch again.","1/10"

Do I start with the Deadpool/Antman Ryan Reynolds hybrid wanna be? Or this random cyclone chick? Who the hell even are they?

The kid acting was unfortunately so bad, it sounds like he was reading script from flashcards and his character is really annoying. Why do they have to do that with kid characters, making them talk non stop, quipping every second, reckless, a liability every step, getting ppl killed, laughing and smiling as ppl are killed, showing no normal reaction to something crazy and scary!?? Why can't these movies make normal human characters.Jokes were childlike and not smooth at all. CGI was too much. No explanation on who the characters really are and why we should care at all.

"Black Adam","ruelshepperd","22 October 2022","The efforts of the DCEU have ranged from great to downright terrible. For every Wonder Woman we get a Justice League and so on. This inconsistency in tone, style and quality has left the DCEU aimless in its path. Black Adam seeks to send the DCEU in a new direction. Does it succeed... No, but it's fine if you turn your brain off.This movie feels like action sequence after action sequence, some of them serviceable, the rest being CGI messes. This movie never stops to take a breath or build character. It is non-stop action leaving you with little care for the characters. There is no real plot to speak of and what there is hangs on a cliched Mcguffin. This film is as simple and brain dead as they come but it is at least entertaining.The characters are all forgettable. Dwayne Johnson broods his way through the film as Black Adam. His character is sort of a fish out of water with some moral greyness and by the end he becomes a better person but otherwise he does not emote or have any true emotional depth that makes me connect with him. The only character who is remotely memorable is Dr Fate played by Pierce Brosnan. He gives a solid performance and there is a cool idea with him being able to see the future and trying to prevent others dying if it means sacrificing himself. Otherwise, the rest of the characters are basic and one note and the antagonist is possibly one of the worst in any superhero film.Overall, Black Adam does offer non-stop mindless action though that action varies heavily in quality and is lacking any form of pretentiousness and heavy-handed messages but it's characters and plot are almost non-existent and it's not a film that will stick with you once you've seen it. It will fly out of your mind faster than Black Adam himself.","6/10"
"Black Adam","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","25 October 2022","Black Adam is a superhero movie's superhero movie: and it seems like critics and audiences (even though they're both one and the same most of the time) are becoming evermore divided on what one group thinks about the productions in question. Yes the film's cliched, yes the characters don't exactly have depth to them through most of the movie, yes the CGI evokes Star-Wars-Prequel-Trilogy-Ragdoll-Physics or 2000s-Ragdoll-Physics, but Dwayne Johnson is such an entertainingly stoic action-man that it's like he's playing an unironic parody of action movies that it just goes with the flow of its own self-aware sense of Hollywood-isms.Black Adam is an origin story, a team-up movie, a villain showcase, and somewhat confused in its fan-service like the LITERAL POSTERS of the Wonder Woman movie, Batman-comic-accurate-artwork, Superman merchandise, Injustice toys (from the video games), and the Suicide-Squad-style intro to our supporting characters makes you wonder... is DC Films self-aware of its success AND shortcomings in the past, and is just throwing everything into a blender with these shared-universe movies? If so: interesting choice. It doesn't work for 'serious cinema' necessarily, but it's a nice approach that can certainly be refined. Just... have the fourth-wall-breaking-fan-service make sense in the story; please?Anywho: Black Adam has FINALLY been released after years of false-starts, Tweets, and studio-reshuffling to make even seasoned studio executives perplexed, and 2022 has Black Adam... breaking away from Shazam entirely. The two were originally gonna be in the Shazam! Movie. Makes you wonder if it should've stayed that way? At least they're finally in cinema: and now they can breathe in sequels I suppose.This movie may not be what some of the fans are expecting, but the fan-service on display does work (when it makes sense) and the action can be a sight to behold, and the leading man himself knows how to rock the spandex look absolutely. The screenplay is a confused mess scared of the antihero theme making 'The Rock' look like a villain; so they sprinkle conflicted protagonist and boom, Black Adam's now a superhero. 3/5 stars.For all that doesn't work in the film, the stuff that does keeps it from becoming downright tedious thankfully. When it's action-heavy it's action-heavy. With the fan service it's going all the way when it can. Just don't expect the story to break your minds or something. It's fairly straightforward stuff: and maybe that's what is bothering the critics.","8/10"
"Black Adam","Vises","22 October 2022","As far as superhero movies go, Black Adam was certainly above average.First of all, great casting... every single main character was likable and believable, especially given the mythical and magical context of the film.Sarah Shahi, Pierce Brosnan and Viola Davis add serious weight and grounding as well.The Rock was definitely made for the title role but his American accent threw me most of the time. Adding some ethnic flavor to his accent would've paid off mightily.Carrying echoes of Snyder but with the treatments and levity of the Wonder Woman and Aquaman entries to the DCEU, Black Adam hits the right notes and solidifies that the DCEU is alive and well.Unless you've been living under a rock, make sure to stick around for the post-credit scene.Solid 8/10.","6/10"
"Black Adam","breneff","19 October 2022","I'm not gonna lie, I never understood why we needed a Black Adam movie. He's an antihero who used to be a Shazam villain. It would make more sense to have him be a villain in the Shazam sequel and then set up his individual film. I don't know why we are trying to have him be the new face of DC. It's also strange that the actor Dwayne Johnson is so obsessed with him being more powerful than Superman. It's cool that the Rock is passionate about this character but after what I just saw it's almost if the only reason why he was passionate about it is because of how powerful and edgy he is in the fact that he's better than everyone else. Also... Black Adam supposed to be Egyptian. The rock is not Egyptian, he doesn't even have Egyptian accent or is even able to speak Egyptian. It bothers me so much and nobody talks about it. They barely care about his backstory at all or his personality. In fact I would say he has zero personality in this movie because all he is is stoic, boring, and power-hungry. I love the rock and the majority of his films but this does kind of feel like a power fantasy he wrote especially due to the fact the guy during the movie barely takes a beating and just rails through all of his adversaries consistently. It's kind of hard to get invested into a character that is basically invincible. Superman is interesting because he has weaknesses and other people that are stronger than him. He's also a humble person and he has a lot going for him personality wise because of his upbringing. There's nothing here other than ""I'm not a hero, and I kill, and I'm super powerful, and nobody can beat me"". That's it that's the entire motive of this guy. It is cool to see a brooding ultraviolent superhero who kills without mercy. But you need to give the character inner turmoil and something to like about him in order for people to really care about him. Then the movie gets into the justice society which is where the movie starts to go downhill even more. These are characters that have never been introduced before and the film seems to care more about powers than it does about the characters origins. Which in all honesty is kind of the main theme of the movie. It just cares about powers. It doesn't care about anything else. Very disappointed.","6/10"
"Black Adam","SnoopyStyle","18 November 2022","It's 2600 BCE in the advanced civilization of Kahndaq. Tyrannical King Ahk-Ton has enslaved the population to mine and build his Crown of Sabbac imbued with dark magical powers. A young slave boy is given the powers of Shazam by the Council of Wizards and he defeated the King. In the present day, Kahndaq is under the control of foreigners out to exploit its resources. Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) works to liberate the country. She finds the crown and unleashes Black Adam (Dwayne Johnson). Amanda Waller declares him a threat and sends the Justice Society. Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) are the members.It must have been a big celebration when Dwayne declared that he wanted to play Black Adam. When a big box office draw wants to lead your franchise, you don't say no. It doesn't mean that he fits the role. The Rock is not Black Adam. The role needs someone darker filled with regret and vengeance. Dwayne may be able to stretch his acting range. He is unable here. The role seems to deaden his natural effervescent personality. He loses his onscreen charms. He can play the role, but there are other actors who could do it better. No matter who, the character still needs more development. The opening flashback story could be expanded. That would punctuate the shock later in the movie. Instead, a lot of story gets crushed under the overstuff CGI action and squeezing so many superheroes into this movie. It should be a Black Adam origin story and only his story. Despite all of this, I am still rooting for The Rock and his work in the DC universe.","1/10"
"Black Adam","anoran108","18 December 2022","Not much to say except that there was no plot, no likeable characters and it should been edited down by 1/2 hour.

Basically, it was like watching a long video game with explosions and over-the-top, non-stop violence. How did Pierce Brosnan get roped into this project? He looked embarrassingly out of place. The teenage kid super heros were 2 dimensional. It was one long, disappointing film and we stopped watching after 20 minutes.","3/10"
"Black Adam","A_Different_Drummer","6 November 2022","Cringe worthy. To review this film is to contemplate the really great film that could have been made for the same budget, perhaps in an alternate universe. Just about everyone in this production is miscast, most especially Johnson who now in his 50s could consider this franchise a retirement program. The script is an abomination, none of the jokes work, and the fact that most of the humor is based on killing people (or not) only deepens the cringe. It does however accomplish one impossible thing -- it makes most of the recent and experimental TV shows from the competing MCU look absolutely brilliant in comparison.

"Black Adam","eddie_baggins","3 November 2022","For a while here there's a sense that DC, on one of its few and far between occasions, has managed to deliver a feature film product worthy of its source material (and extensive budgets) with director Jaume Collet-Serra managing to start Black Adam in a fun and exciting fashion that seems to suggest audience goers were going to be treated to something a little unexpected, something just slightly amended from the usual playbook of initial superhero adventures but then all hope and excitement is extinguished by a teenage boy and his ever-present skateboard.More on that later.A much-hyped production that its leading man has been championing for the better part of the last few years, Black Adam presents DC with one of its greatest chances yet to bring one of its more complicated creations to screen and while his natural charisma (that you either love or hate) is mainly squashed in a role that brings to mind Arnie from Terminator 2, Dwayne Johnson fits the bill to be our anti-hero Teth Adam but despite some impressively staged early action scenes and a narrative that doesn't always play to the rules set out for large blockbuster origin stories such as this, Black Adam is unable to keep the foot on the gas as some questionable narrative decisions and character inclusions halt much of the films progress in being a silly but fun popcorn munching ride.There are times here when you forget you're watching a Black Adam film with Bodhi Sabongui and Sarah Shahi's Kahndaq natives Adrianna and Amon Tomaz joining Adam's journey as he awakens from a 5000 year slumber to all of a sudden be battling unknown forces and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman led Justice Society, with these two characters playing large roles in proceedings to an extent they become a genuine annoyance and by the time Amon is rallying local citizens in one of the most cringe-worthy battle cries committed to celluloid before leading a charge on his beloved skateboard you know that Black Adam has failed to hit the mark.These glaringly non-important characters and plot diversions do in some ways mask other problems that become more apparent as Black Adam's runtime wears on with Collet-Serra's insistence on including either a blasting musical score or Spotify 101 pump up songs in all of his abundant slow-mo action scenes or a collection of underdeveloped characters that includes the films main villain and Justice Society members Atom Smasher and Cyclone other reasons why the film fails to go on with its various moments of promise, with one almost wishing we were allowed more time to get to know Adam or even Pierce Brosnan's Dr. Fate/Kent Nelson, who steals many of the films best scenes with one hoping the veteran screen actor gets a chance to shine in a solo outing in the near future.To be fair to all involved, Black Adam is far from the worst DC movie to come our way but in regards to promise and potential verses the final outcome, this loud, colourful and soulless outing is equivalent to the likes of Man of Steel and Suicide Squad as features that seemed to be set to shine only for poor decisions and weak directive decisions hampering any chance they had of shining on the big stage.Final Say -Not without its moments, Black Adam is hampered by an increasingly painful plot-line and even worse supporting characters that take away from the films early signs that it is looking to do something a little different than the usual origin story run-through.2 1/2 skateboards out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","5/10"
"Black Adam","Drawmort","16 November 2022","There is probably nothing in this review that hasn't already been said before. The first film to reveal Black Adam to the world is not even close to the expectations nor the level of marketing raised by its producers and protagonist. Usually, excessive paraphernalia is the mask of a bad product and Black Adam confirms it.The whole show staged looks like a superhero movie from the early 2000's. Too much badly applied CGI, too empty a plot, too many catchphrases and heroic poses.The photography is horrible. I hated the lenses chosen for this film. There's only 1 shot where it's justifiable, and it's 1 second long. The visual effects are overdone, the colors are oversaturated, the color filters are a poor imitation of previous movies. This is just an accumulation of scenes that were meant to be spectacular, but don't land well, because it's all so pretentious. Overall, the action, humor, acting, and sound editing are mediocre.Recommendable? Only if you're a turn-of-the-century TV seller looking for a couple of eye-catching images to make your products stand out a bit.2022 closes as one of the worst years for superhero cinema.","10/10"

It seemed like the actors themselves were bored. Dialogues were weak. The story was even weaker.A climax never happened and the movie never got better.Nothing came together. Just a water effort.

And don't get me started on the cringe worthy dialogues.Btw, it's super obvious and sad to see DC studios trying to copying so unashamedly (and failing) several Marvel movies, In Black Adam you may recognize a mixture of X-Men, Deadpool, Dr Strange, SHIELD and Wakanda.

"Black Adam","cruise01","22 October 2022","5 out of 5 stars.Black Adam is an awesome superhero film that is big, action packed, and it delivers a big blockbuster film. Dwayne Johnson who is producing and starring in the film has been dedicated to this project for years. Its finally out in the big screen and he takes the project and delivered it to his fans. They can expect a big blockbuster action film and delivering the anti hero DC character.The plot is good showing Adam (Dwayne Johnson) brought back in the present time when a group of mercenaries are after a crown which can resurrect evil. Adam takes justice into his own hands and is on the search for the crown with the help of Adrianna (Sarah Shahi). While the Justice Society lead by Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) is on the hunt to stop Adam from leaving a huge body count.The film is non stop action with one set piece to another. The action sequences are big and exciting. The visual effects are great. Dwayne Johnson delivers with the role. Along with Aldis Hodge, Noah Centineo, Quintessa Swindell, and Pierce Brosnan with there roles in the justice society. Sarah Shahi did great as well. Marwan Kenzari as the villain was also good.The film is exciting and it is one fun entry in the DC franchise with giving a fast paced direction which it may over shadow any development to any characters and story. It is one adrenaline fueled direction that will put the audiences into a wild action ride that makes you want to see it again.There is a mid credit scene that will have the audiences cheering for another film.","6/10"
"Black Adam","MiroslavKyuranov","19 October 2022","""The new era"" for the DCEU is here, but sadly, it's not quite the jump in quality the cinematic universe truly needed.The introduction of Black Adam is flawed as many of the previous DCEU movies have been, and there are no notable changes in direction that make it stick out in its own way. The movie fails to find a unique mark and doesn't really have anything interesting to say.If everything you want from a superhero movie is the action, you got it, also sometimes the CGI feels overused. Try to go any deeper than that, and there's not much else to be found.Best part of the movie must be Brosnan's Doctor Fate, but he can't carry the whole movie just by the look of his character. There needs to be a story...a good one, which is missing here.There's not much that can be said about the film's villain, Sabbac, without spoiling the film. However, even if spoilers weren't an issue, there's still basically nothing interesting to say about him.Even with all that said, given how big Dwayne Johnson is and how much power he seems to have over the franchise (and now the DCEU as well), fans should expect Black Adam to carry on in a big way going forward for better or for worse. New hierarchy they said? Yeah. No.","1/10"
"Black Adam","shanzaybasharat","22 October 2022","Its so bad like i cant even put it into words, casting dwayne and noah, giving no backstory to new characters, the scary ass villains getting conned by a child, a MOM giving orders to a bunch of said powerful heroes and they actually taking them from her like wtf, so many unnecessary slow mo shots, shitty tragic pasts making no relation, the corny jokes, loooord the corny jokes making me puke, they tried to do so much yet did so little, literally looked it they tried to cram everything into one film so itll put some food on their tables and free viola davis ffs, shes not needed, anywhere, a tragedy.","6/10"
"Black Adam","CarolineFR69","15 November 2022","I was so disappointed with this one, and the friend I saw it with thought the same. We went to see the movie because Dwayne Johnson is in it, obviously, but also because we like that kind of movie. And I feel like DC just doesn't know how to show grief. They failed in Batman vs Superman, and they fail with Black Adam. In the movie you have Teth Adam, seen as a hero by an enslaved population that is still enslaved today, fighting against the Justice Society, supposedly a superhero team, as well as fighting against the villain with the crown of Sabbac. Teth Adam is basically Deadpool without the comedy, he kills his (evil) opponents to save others, and that's the only reason why the Justice Society think of him as evil, while the whole population sees him as their saviour. If this was not already bad enough, said Justice Society is boring very fast, with the same slow motion shots, which are cool the first time you see them, but just don't work throughout the movie, and a team lead that is just not the hero he should be. The whole movie feels like a parody of a superhero movie, with Dwayne Johnson wasted as a hero, when he could have been perfect for the role with the right director. The redeeming grace is the Tomaz family that you follow throughout the movie, with the mother being truly good and wanting to save her people, and the kid believing in Teth Adam so much that he teaches him how to act in the modern world. The movie was saved in our eyes with the post credit scene, that showed hopefully a better next movie.","10/10"
"Black Adam","rh_0809","20 October 2022","Finally a movie gives the feeling that DC are making great movies again. First of all, it may not be comic accurate at all but Dwayne Johnson is the perfect casting for Black Adam. Also the Justice Society castings were great, although we did not get much to know about their backstories. Their past and their development may be one of the few things that was missing in the plot. But fortunately it did not disturb anything about the backstory and the development of Black Adam himself. Unlike the other DC movies, the darkness was adjusted better this time. Also the very little piece of comedy has found a place in the Movie. The surprise in the post credit scene was just awesome and hope giving for the next projects of DC. The film is recommended.","1/10"
"Black Adam","aurorbr","20 October 2022","Black Adam a film with a banal plot.It's not a funny movie, it's not a well-written movie, it's not a movie that leaves you with something, it's not a movie that enriches the characters, in short it's bad movie.Modest graphics, trivial story, a fairly bad DC film in terms of script and story.Action scenes that are repeated without any conviction. The ending is predictable and predictable, I would have liked something different, but instead we had a film that repeats many other films of the past, without any originality. Everything already seen, everything already done, everything predictable, everything repetitive.","4/10"
"Black Adam","Animus","18 February 2023","Black Adam tries so hard to be an MCU movie that it's painful to watch at some points. The premise is set up in the opening narration buuuuuut don't put too much stock in it since the movie retcons that not once but TWICE within the film. The story is fairly generic and derivitive of the MCU movies, bad guy mercs on flying bikes (the Chitauri), magic minerals (Vibranium), supercharged weapons (stark tech), an out of touch hero (Thor) who doesn't understand the world, and so on. The only thing different is that instead of the Avengers we get Suicide Squad 2.5 with their own Dr Strange, Giant-man, Storm and Falcon knock offs who have no clue what 'teamwork means', not in the beginning, not in the middle and not really at the end either.If you like Dwayne Johnson being clueless and saying things that are funny because he is clueless, then this a movie you'll enjoy. If you like lots of special effects for no good reason, again - this is for you since many of the scenes and effects are gratuitous. If you want a coherent plot, interesting characters and events that make sense... go somewhere else.","4/10"
"Black Adam","michael-561-692892","9 December 2022","Did the fools of DC not learn a dang thing from the failure that was Justice League? This endless explosion followed by explosion with a demon with mutated voice is almost a copy cat of that horrible mess. About a hour into this you begin to wonder if this was written by teenaged boys. I feel terrible now that I have wasted so much of my time and money watching this. There's no redeeming this garbage pile. The scene with black Adam ripping the Satan dude in half was enough for me to forever give up on DC. I think I only watched up until the very end to see Superman one last time. Such a sad day.","1/10"
"Black Adam","dmach-61247","21 October 2022","I am tired about this kind of movies! You sit in your chair, wait for a great story to develop and they nearly ALWAYS start with telling you a complete back story in itself in the first two minutes of film. WHY? Where is ""Show, don't tell!""? I am watching this to see it unfold and not get a backstory pushed into my brain in two minutes. After being flashed like this I do not care anymore about the rest of the film because I already know what awaits. Gone is the magic of an unfolding universe. Already did see it compressed into the first two minutes before... so the rest is just more of the same lame stuff! ""Black Magic"" makes also no sense to use in a Superhero movie which is based on Science-Fiction 90%. There is a reason magic is NOT a driving force in comics!Please Hollywood stop giving us this nerdlike movies and concentrate on telling good and big stories again without starting a movie with a compressed two minute movie in itself! Makes NO SENSE!","6/10"
"Black Adam","kupukupumu","8 December 2022","First of all, I am not a fan of the Rock, but he is the perfect cast for Black Adam, especially when he sat on the throne. And, I had been anticipating this movie sonce the trailer showed additional cast of Justice Society members. The Hawkman, especially, but it turned into disappointment. First, why a black Carter, in a movie that already has so much diversity in the casts? Second, the Hawkman's character here felt more like Chickenman to me. Since when Hawkman, and Justice Society, work for Amanda???And, Justice Society were supposed to be in the WW2 era, not present day. Also, Amanda already has Suicide Squad in this universe. Very bad writing and continuity.The script is also very bad and stupid in a very smart, brave and heroic woman that suddenly gave up the world begging the villain to spare her son.And, many other stupid scenes. Too many to tell here.Shazam movie was miles better than this.This movie could be better. Or, maybe my expectation was too high.","3/10"
"Black Adam","kmontgomery-98515","14 November 2022","Aldis Hodge was a great Hawkman!!! Best live action version of that character.The backgrounds look like cut scenes from 2000s video games (or the Scorpion Game) and the lore dumps were painful. This should have been a 90 minute movie with none of that lore exposition until the last act. The entire beginning with the slaves and political talk was painful after seeing how artfully that's been handles in other movies.I would have preferred this movie to just have Hawkman & Black Adam team up against mercenaries instead of all the extra weird plot stuff. Kahndaq is suppose to be Sinai ruled by mercenaries but that doesn't make sense. Even in countries with large mercenary control there's always at least a fake government. They should have started with a map showing where this fictional country is (modern day Sinai, Egypt) and introduce us by showing the oppression of the citizens via mercenaries and the reverence to the statue. Cut to the mom reseructing Adam. All this in the cold open. Then Adam gors on a bad ramage of the mercs. Hawkman volunteers and goes and tries to stop him, fails, and then tries to convince him to be good. Boom - we now have anti-hero tension. Hawkman has to address whether due process is really working in fake Sinai and Black Adam has to realize that simply killing everyone in power doesn't work. But instead we got a 2 hour mess of a plot with an amazing cast. Oh well.","5/10"
"Black Adam","nazdezigns","30 November 2022","From the first part of the movie, well until to the last, this movie is full of plot holes. Using the Rock with already established persona and icon just ruining the character of Black Adam. The sadness and sorrow of Black Adam character just cant seems to appear. To do that you must have a top level acting. All too focus on the pride, vicious aspect of him. Also how come he knows english language after 5000 years in sleep?And Hawkman is a hero with blind loyalty on Waller (who's the leader of Suicide Squad that kills even many innocent people) seems to value the bad guys life than all the people of Khandaq - while we know that his fights and his plane crash is destroying the city with potential death all over - with dialogues that only satisfy elementary kids level.Dr fate can read peoples fate (and tell them), but cant seem to know the fate of his own word to others.Atom Smasher and Cyclone did not have a good character foundation and character development also with dull dialogues. You cant beat ant-man. You should go with genius Atom though.And cyclone throws pipes on rocket bomb invincible of Black Adam seems very wrong...The cringe Amon's mother is all to blame on all this incident but seems not have any remorse whatsoever. Except the loss of husband. Very selfish.The more ever cringe Amon character is like his dialogue are written by a high school kid that just enter the comic writing world.The zombies?? I know you need the people to do their part, but zombies appear out of nowhere with no role on the story and only fights the people? Come on...However, the special effect is great. They put a lot of money and effort in this. And also working with a real and professional DC comic book fan or writer on this aspect.Suggestion. Dont let the rock be the producer. Use professional comic book editor to do that.Like me, my 11 year old kid cant seems to enjoy the story but he enjoy the effects.","1/10"
"Black Adam","wannadance-70985","3 December 2022","First of all I must say, I am so glad (maybe even thankful) I did not go to the theater. If all you want is Dwayne Johnson, CGI, and an over abundance (AND I MEAN OVER ABUNDANCE) of slow motion action shots, then this movie is for you. The movie jumps in right away with the plot with zero set up. No backstory, nothing really beyond what made him BA and even that felt rushed. In interviews DJ said this movie is for fans. What fans? Not fans of superhero movies. I would rather watch the version of Joss Whedon's Justice league then watch this movie again. The way Atom Smasher and Cyclone were introduced is utterly laughable. If Dwayne Johnson is going to be one of the heavy hitters for DC Studios going forward and this is the of quality product made, it'll be a dead franchise in no time.","5/10"
"Black Adam","imseeg","31 October 2022","For those who are into these kind of fantasy action movies it is not a terrible one. That is to say at the start...The bad: this movie relies TOO heavily on CGI action scenes. There is a limit too how much CGI action upon action I can take, before my mind gets numb.I get it, this movie is targetted at teenagers, who just want an overload of flashing action packed scenes. But even for teenagers I would not recommend this movie, because this movie is seriously lacking in actor's chemistry.More bad; there are too many characters, too many action scenes, but WAY TOO few characters actually speaking and interacting with each other.Dwayne Johnson is cool as superman like action god, but he aint particularly funny this time around. And after the quatrillion CGI fight with Dwayne Johnson I fell asleep....Not terrible, but definitely not the best fantasy action movie either. NOT recommended...","4/10"
"Black Adam","ijameson","30 December 2022","Another silly origin story that has few redeeming qualities.If the point was to show the superheroes as arrogant and unappealing, then mission accomplished.And why so many, especially minor inconsequential characters? Only 2 of the superheroes made any contribution, so why add another 2 who didn't? One was the obvious comic relief, but the other had no purpose.Black Adam was pretty useless. A being possessing god -like powers, who is easily defeated? Come on. His disdain for life got old quickly. As did his disdain for doors. His attempts at humour failed badly.There was no point to this movie, and it's unlikely there will be a sequal.","4/10"
"Black Adam","loganschainker","22 October 2022","My expectations for Black Adam were rather low. It was either going to be awful or dumb fun. Obviously, it was awful. I'm surprised this film is getting mixed reception, and not just flat-out bad reception. The story was bland, the CGI was terrible, and the dialogue was painfully generic. Dwayne Johnson delivered a very dull performance. Majority of his lines were (as I stated earlier) generic. The third act is nothing but loud, brain-frying, CGI nonsense. Apparently this film was supposed to be rated R, honestly it would have benefited significantly. We've seen before that DC has no quarrels with making they're films R. The story would have been way more interesting if the main ""antagonists"" were just the JLA. Who by the way were incredibly underused and underdeveloped. It could have made for a unique narrative that was told from a perspective that we don't usually see in comic-book films.","8/10"
"Black Adam","timk76","19 October 2022","DC delivers again. I loved Wonder Woman, Aquaman as well as Zack Snyder's Justice League. Black Adam is right up there. It has everything you need for a super hero movie.A great cast. In particular Pierce Brosnan. It's good to see him return to the big screen in such an iconic role.An original script.Amazing action scenes.You can tell that the movie was more than ten years in the making based on its attention to detail in the production. Starting from the special effects up to the costume designs.I don't know much about the original comic or the DC universe in general. But I love the idea of an anti-hero saving the world on its own terms. This grittier and darker approach totally works for me and could be a door opener for a whole new sub-genre.","2/10"

The Rock still cannot act and all attempts at it are stilted and wasteful of camera space. Don't pretend like this person can act - it is never going to be believed. Next - does every scene have to be accompanied by an orchestra - was a whole bunch of really bad music. The other super heroes were alright but it just didn't seem to be a good fit. And finally, when is CGI just way over the top because this was as close as it gets. Does CGI ever get to the point where film creators just use it to create great scenes as opposed to creating a scene that appears unbelievable while being unbelievable?","6/10"

By a clear margin the best superhero film in many years, with the Rock bringing a truckload of intensity and presence to the character, a great story from the point of view of the anti-hero that is not often told, and truly entertaining supporting characters. This is what fans want to see, this is how these movies should be made. And an absolute epic showdown incoming that is already building excitement.No one should have the slightest interest what the 'critics' have to say - very rarely do they write reviews focused on the actual content anymore. They are the antithesis of what art and movie-making represents - and they are gloriously being drowned out by this fantastic film. Thank you Rocky!","6/10"
"Black Adam","dschlatter","23 October 2022","I like Dwayne Johnson's work. He has charm, comedic timing, and he can play the bad ass. The DC people are just not my kind of movie makers, so I left the theater disappointed.Why is that? I like Marvel Movies better. The humor is light. The character development is done more efficiently. The action looks less Computer generated.DC's style just doesn't work for me. They take such joy in showing off Adam's Superman-like strenght, it becomes boring. Endless hovering and flying around with clenched fists... And the lightning looks exactly, like whenever The Flash does his thing. What they fail to do, is make me care about what happens to the characters. Pierce Brosnan is the exeption. But Cyclone? She is just a pretty face they kept showing me in slow motion.I did appreciate the dynamic between the Justice Society and Adam.I just think, DC worships their characters so much, they forget that they have people in the audience who have not read the books. These people needs to first get to know and then learn to like the characters in under an hour. Same with the villains. They can't just be a prop at the end. They too need character development. DC fails at that so often.The batman movies were the exeption. Justice League, Suicide Squad (not The..), Wonder Woman, etc. Are the rule.","9/10"
"Black Adam","nabeel-40851","19 October 2022","It was Great from DC to not show every scene in the Trailer. Movie is packed with action and there are tons of sequences which are not rushed in my opinion. ROCK is ROCK and he did Great Black Adam. Movie had good moments with humor but it did not turned out to be a comedy film or the theme got lighter in any sense. Hawkeye and Fate were really good, others were okay but these two are actually the ACE in the team. I would only suggest anyone who is going to watch this movie. Don't compare it with anything else. Black Adam is its own movie. We have not seen any other movie with Anti-hero theme besides the ""Morbius"" but these two cannot be compared.

"Black Adam","michaelwplde","22 October 2022","There was obviously a lot of hype heading into this one, no pun intended, i.e. Black adams forehead, but about all that bought them was The Rock's neckline and shoulders, shiny, thick and broad as they may be. Other than that, I feel like they missed a golden opportunity to pay off such a historic team up in the Justice Society, especially we have seen cameos of 'the team', IIRC, in Stargirl, for instance. Really missed the mark on the DC verse hero characters, IMO. Fate, feel like he was nothing more than a fancy magician illusionist, one avenue removed from the Las Vegas strip; lost on this effort was the mystique in that persona. Hawkman, bold, bravado, maybe, about 50% passable delivery IMO. And there was one sequence, in particular, in which, was it really that necessary, even to setup 'what came next', overly gratuitous, unnecessary, IMO. By contrast, at least they had the class to suggest, 'and maybe smash a few things along the way' with Professor Hulk and Avengers Endgame. Cyclone, wasn't she 'white', granddaughter of Red Tornado? So of course they had to make her 'black'. Atom Smasher, no opinion really, other than it seemed like he was the latinx comic relief, actually just about all the 'heroes' had some misfit comic element about them. Which may be what they were aiming at considering the central figure was the villan (ahem) 'anti-hero' Black Adam. Any version of the character, though, I've ever seen depicted, is not so shallow, not so wooden, a bit more depth and range in his character, even in spite of him being a culturally distant misfit. Also one of the closing moments in the flick, feel like they missed a golden opportunity to pay off BA's 'team player' motif in Shazam power sharing, but maybe that is an ability exclusive to Shazam, IDK. About the only two personas they 'got right' at all, or that were consistent, anyway, with previous continuum efforts, was Waller and Harcourt, props for that segue, actually. Perhaps the only thing possibly worth mentioning was the Superman post credits segue, which of course is another classic.","9/10"
"Black Adam","kadenkgcampbell","20 October 2022","I believe that when rating a movie you must rate it for what it is, in the genre in which in belongs. This isn't a movie to take serious or a movie trying to attain awards. It's a action superhero movie and for it being that it was pretty great.The action was amazing and the CGI was great. I heard some people say the CGI was bad which boggles my mind of how picky and spoiled you must be. Black Adam fighting, the Dr Fate scenes, Cyclone and Adam Smasher it all looked amazing.Yes some parts were cliche but what can we expect? There's been 100s of superhero movies doesn't every movie ever have a least a few cliches? (Most definitely).The movie was much better than some other DC movies and I really enjoyed the overpowered beast of a character in Black Adam. The Rock did a great job for once being a wrestler. I am also SO GLAD Henry Cavill is back as Superman (we need the Man of Steel 2). It's been a long time since we've seen him. He's a perfect Superman. The Rock is a perfect Black Adam.","4/10"
"Black Adam","joshgerlach","7 December 2022","This movie is not bad per se.Interesting story, interesting twist, interesting action, very good effects.Dwayne Johnson, Quintessa Swindell, Noah Centineo, Aldis Hodge, Mohammed Amir, and Marwan Kenzari all do fine. Pierce Brosnan does excellently as always and I would love to see more of his Dr. Fate.Two actors stand out as particularly bad; Sarah Shahi, and Bodhi Sabongui. I don't know what caused this. It could be a number of things, but I think it could be boiled down to acting through an accent that was unnatural to them.Sabongui is Canadian, and Shahi is from Texas, and their ADR was also bad, so the accent is probably where I'd put my money on what went wrong there. They simply do a bad job. Sabongui has only 7 credits to his name, so I can hardly fault him for that, he should have been guided more.The canned cinematic score was a let down. Some of the rock songs were just weirdly placed, and they feel like an afterthought rather than a choice. Probably to try to connect it better to Shazam and The Suicide Squad, which it didn't really need. Chiseling out an identity of its own would have been better.4/10 take more risks. If you're gonna make billions globally anyway, it might as well also be a ripping good movie, too. If it's a studio interference problem, tell the studio to get bent.","8/10"
"Black Adam","lakings97","24 October 2022","Black Adam is a DC movie with Dwayne Johnson as Teth Adam who is brought back to current time after 5,000 years of imprisonment. Justice Society with a group of superhero's aim to stop Back Adam from destroying his home town of Kahndaq which is a made up country like Wakanda where the country is under suppression. The superhero's headed by Hawkman played by Aldis Hodge, Kent Nelson played by Pierce Brosnan, Atom Smasher played by Noah Centineo, and Cyclone played by Quintessa Swindell. Each have similar characteristics as Marvel characters, DC always plays second fiddle they can never match up to Marvel but this flick was not half bad. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that when Black Adam was first came on screen he immediately knew how to speak English. Sarah Shahi played a big role as the person who released Black Adam. Overall it was a fun, entertaining, and delightful movie I definitely recommend.","2/10"
"Black Adam","Mykewood","21 October 2022","Slight spoilers I guess.I went in with low expectations. The scenes copied from every other super hero film, the terrible CGI sets (how did the scene of the JSA flying out of their underground base look worse than a very similar scene from the 1st X-men film, 22 years ago? How is that even possible?), the CGI monstrosity ""villain"" at the end... Really derailed a decent film. Adam's true origin was a nice twist. I really liked Hawkman & Dr Fate. Just wish we'd gotten more time with them. Adam Smasher & wind girl were ok but ultimately forgettable. I feel like they needed to allow more time with Adam, the woman, & her son 1st. Establish the city villains fully. Then have the JSA come in. Also the hypocrisy of Hawkman yapping at Adam when he works for AMANDA WALLER? Like, really? Fate knows everything, but doesn't know they work for one of the worst people on the planet? Would have been much better to explore that than the video game boss at the end. Lost opportunity. 5/10.","4/10"
"Black Adam","opheophe","28 December 2022","What do we have...The story in short is:
# Black Adam is bad
# There are some other characters that has 0 impact on the story
# Black Adam is perhaps kinda good but in a bad way
# Kills bad guy no effort
# The endThe story in slightly more words...
# Black Adam was a bad superhero that got put to sleep
# Plottwist: His son was a good superhero, but he gave his powers to Adam to save him. Son got killed. Adam did bad things in revenge.# Bad guys want demon crown
# Plottwist: The bad guy is in fact an ancestor to the king Adams son defeated.# 4 superheroes appear: Hawkman (badly defined powers, no backstory), Dr Fate (can see into the future, badly defined powers, found a magic helmet in a 10 sec backstory), Cyclone (pointless, has no impact on the story at all, can make cyclones, badly defined powers), Atom Smasher (pointless, has no impact on the story at all, can become really big, like Ant-man but without the charm)
# Superheroes attack Black Adam with CGI, but Adam cannot be hurt by CGI.# Adam and superheroes team up
# Bad guy get demon crown but dies
# Adam gives up his powers for no reason, gets thrown in prison
# Plottwist: He died but by dying he gets demon powers
# The guy that can look into the future sees that things are going bad, frees Adam and then dies a pointless death.# Adam, without powers, appears to be invulnerable, regains his powers
# The bad guy summons the legions of hell. The legions gets defeated by 30 random people wielding blunt objects.# CGI fight with the bad guy, Adam wins
# The endWith a story like this, why wasn't the movie great?#####First of all, Adam is immortal, apart from when he was hurt for 30 sec in the beginning nothing can harm him. Even when he doesn't have his powers he's pretty much invulnerable. The superheroes can't really get hurt either. Dr Fate dies in his fight agains tthe bad guy, but it's announced in advance that he will die and that the bad guy will defeat him, meaning there's no surprise that the bad guy wont care no matter how much CGI Dr Fate throws at him. In the last fight between Adam and the bad guy neither can be harmed by the CGI at all, untill Adam rips the bad guy apart. The fights are perhaps well made, but when you know that noone will die (except when you know someone will die) there are no stakes and no surprises. I have to wonder... why do directors think that fights between immortal gods are fun to watch? Even Adam Wests batman from 1966 is more exciting since you don't know the outcome of every fight!#####Investment in characters... I don't care about Adam... I'm told he was bad, but then perhaps goodish... ok fine, he's immortal, who cares. Our other heroes... I don't care about them... They have no backstory, I have no emotional investment in them. Dr Fate dies, but you know he will in advance, there are no surprises at all! It would have taken only a minor rewrite to leave the other heres out from the movie completely, they are nothing but empty filler.The villain... he wants the crown, he gets the crown he dies. There is no investment in his goals. You barely even know if he has goals other than killing Black Adam.There is also a mother and her son, but they are so generic and bland you don't really care about them. The mother finds the crown, her kid almost gets killed, Almost no impact on the story.In other words, you don't care about any of the characters. They are emtpy shells. If each of the characters had had an origin story, perhaps their own movie, you might care, but they don't. In Marvels End-game you care about Stark dying because you've been with that character through a lot of movies, the death has impact and meaning. If he had died in the first movie without having any impact at all noone would have cared.#####The plottwists... why do we have the plottwists?A plottwist is a nice storytelling device when it surprises you...
But... the original hero wasn't Adam but his son, and his son died to give Adam his powers... why? Just let Adam have the powers and start out with good intentions but go bad when his son dies, no need for a twist!<eneric good guy is in fact are a generic bad guy that wants a crown isn't really doing anything. Had we been invested in the character as a good guy him being bad might have had some impact, but we don't get invested in characters at all here. And the plottwist that he's in fact related to the bad king... who cares? We're still not invested in him.Dr Fate sees that Hawkman will die... but in a twist he decides to kill himself for no reason at all. He could just have said, oh, hol' up folks, let's free Adam and let him deal with the bad guy.The twists add nothing, they almost seems tacked on in the script. Remove them and it would have been the same movie.#####This movie isn't exactly bad, it's just bland and pointless. Unlike Shazam it isn't even funny. It's understandable that DC wants ensamble movies just like Marvel, but they don't make any attempts to get you invested in them. The technical quality of the movie is overall good, the acting is good, the casting is good. There is even fairly good chemistry between the characters. Just a pity the script is bad.As for the fights... CGI-fights with characters flying all around, with noone ever reacting to getting punched into the ground etc... those fights are not fun. Considering the budgets they should be able to hire someone to make the fights engaging. Perhaps the story isn't great, and perhaps the characters aren't developed, but if the fights are fun you can still enjoy it, just like you enjoy cheesy 1-man-army movies from 1980-1990.#####Final judgement: Watch this movie if you've got nothing else to do. You will get a bit bored at the CGI-fights and you wont care about any of the characters... at all... but perhaps you want some mindless fodder for the brain.","1/10"
"Black Adam","icminindy","1 November 2022","I was hoping for a great flick, but I was sadly disappointed. Poor continuity, silly in so many ways where it was clearly unintentional. I am a huge fan of marvel and dc movies but I think it time to admit the new ""direction "" isn't working and get back to their roots and stop making expensive forgettable trash. I didnt care about one single character in this movie. No one to root for!!!! I can only recommend anyone watch this if you have nothing else to do, its free, and you aren't wasting your own electricity to see it. To the actors in this movie; fire your agents for doing this to you and stop letting producers of crap from using you.","1/10"
"Black Adam","B-Thunder","20 October 2022","Black Adam: a film not at all original, full of sequences already seen in the past in other films. I didn't like the CGI they used to make this film. The plot of the film is predictable and repetitive. Is now a product devoid of originality, they always repeat the usual plots. Is now an old and overused product. 1/10, ""Black Adam repetitive."" An overall bellow average movie in a franchise that is way beyond its prime and runs purely on nostalgia.A forgettable film, nothing memorable. And finally, 3D proves to be a massive decline in almost every aspect.Disappointing, nothing more to add....","4/10"
"Black Adam","elhonig-902-129896","29 November 2022","The recipe is familiar - take some folks in trouble from the ancients, add some minimal acting from super heroes and heroines, mix in lots of CGI, a booming soundtrack, a dozen huge explosions, and spread the ingredients liberally over a paper thin script. There you have it - a mindless 2 hour movie, intended to be entertaining but falls short.Dwayne Johnson barely phones in his part as Black Adam.The other actors, including Pierce Brosnan, seem to be there as mostly wallpaper. The movie ends with a hint that there will be a Black Adam 2. I sincerely hope not, unless they have a chance to improve on the theme. Watch this if you like this sort of movie, but go in with low expectations.","6/10"
"Black Adam","christopherstamp","19 October 2022","The start of this movie was quite good - when you first meet black Adam. It feels like a super hero movie mixed with flavours and graphic violence of Indiana jones. Watching a man be reduced to ash in front of your eyes - felt like the scene from Raiders.Also Dwayne's movements, lack of effort to tear vehicles in half, etc. Was perfect to watch. As an individual of this strength would do these things with little effort like when we trample grass.However the rest of the movie feels like repeats of previous movies combined. Either early comic book movies = X-men - Ceribro like interiors, x-men - manor building.To recent AntMan retreads, trying to copy but falling short to add anything new.To Jason and the argonauts = with strange chi skeletons with swords.Also it feels like extremely long actions sequences, lead directly into another extremely long (and repetitive) action sequences. Which are unnecessary, and feel like where included just because 1 person in the creative team likes it so kept it in (hover bikes + bike chase).Unfortunately it is due to the repeated dejavu that brings you out of the movie.Lastly the writing could have been better and again pulls you out of the movie.Why does Black Adam know modern catchphrases? Why is humor forced in? To copy Marvel? Why are popular 80s songs sprinkled in randomly?Overall: good potential - however tries to do to much, and also relieve too heavily on what has came before and been successful in other superhero and pop cultural movies.","6/10"
"Black Adam","justinyap","25 October 2022","Black Adam is poorly written and unnatural paced while packs with plot holes, cringey sequences, and weak side-character development. Short screentime between main character and side characters make it even more pointless and emotionless, and plenty of awkward acting from fast paced sequence cringes the mood throughout the film, However, the humour, action sequences and tone are slightly above average which makes the only positive aspects for the show. Meanwhile, The Rock nailed the character well and the whole film exceeded personal expectation making it sufficiently entertaining for a mere 2 hours.","2/10"
"Black Adam","subpardaemon","9 December 2022","This... film?, let's call it that, commits the worst offence: it's boring. It's anti-entertainment. You don't get involved as all characters are bland and there is zero chance at feeling anything is seriously at stake. All that remains is a yawn worthy series of bad cgi scenes, faux grand scale, offensively juvenile humor, and...... okay, there is a saving grace, the electrician uncle is fun. He is the one star from the two i gave this film.So the rock's superpower is that he looks incredibly pumped up but he offsets it with a kind of charisma of having a sense of humor that is self-aware. Now, this is missing from this film completely.Aldis hodge... sorry, he just does not cut it as a superhero. He doesn't have the gravitas, and his smarm and smirk that usually works in his favor just falls flat here.Piece brosnan... besides the paycheck, what was he thinking?!And that's it. Let's forget this film exists, it will be best for everyone.","6/10"
"Black Adam","njbono-21375","22 October 2022","I know so many will say I'm being picky but Dwayne Johnson shouldn't have been cast in this roll, honestly this is movie is to big for him.His lines are so simplistic that I wonder if he can do more.I honestly believe in a few years many will feel the same.And he seems to pose in every scene wirh very limited motion for the most part.. it's just strange.Ok as for the movie - its fun, some really great battle scenes and well directed. The story line is a bit odd at times, almost repetitive and the movie is 20mins too long. There are plenty of laughs, which were fun but I honestly think because DJ is the actor - it can't be so serious.I'm starting to feel we are near the end of all these standard good vs evil super hero films done this way... very clean, simple plot, same formula. Yea Batman, Superman and a few others will survive because they tend to have a deeper plot. Look even Star Wars is getting warn out; same plot different actors.","6/10"
"Black Adam","IcarusMoon","10 December 2022","The movie has its flaws and its funny moments, but the kid! Doesn't listen to his mother, rides a skateboard, it's the driven reason why anything happens in the movie because he wants to be in the middle of danger and to see what's happening - Rolling my eyes hard!. There are also some dumb decisions made by the bad guys that doesn't make any sense either!The CGI is good, the action sequences are different than Marvel. And like any DC film as of this point, the characters are fragmented, shallow, no backstories.There is a lot of killing in this movie, you could say comedic killing hence the PG-13 rating. It's a good weekend movie, but I don't know if it's movie theater worthy.","5/10"
"Black Adam","marineproductions1","19 November 2022","The plot is very predictable. As soon as the guys came out, you know who's the bad guy and what's going to happen. He's eventually going to get that crown and our hero is going to beat him. This might sound like a spoiler but when you watch the movie, you already know what's going to happen next and it's exactly what you think would happen. The acting is awkward. Many lines were forced. The camera work isn't quite there yet. In that I mean there is a shot where the hawk guy says we need Adam to do it, but then he's already gone, and before the audience can react to it the movie already cut to the next scene with loud music and action sequences. It lacks clarity in telling you what's going on. And what's up with all the zombies? They like making zombie movie? Well this feels like a B-movie quality plot. I can't believe they even made this movie this bad. The music in itself is okay but the way they pair it with the visuals just make everything a noise rather than a piece to enjoy.","10/10"

"Black Adam","matt_hew","10 July 2023","If any producers or directors want a blueprint of how to make a superhero movie than this anti-hero film is the antithesis of that blueprint.From the outset you can just tell that it is going to be awful and the formulaic tick box clichés come thick and fast.Starts with a very quick world building backstory exercise.Jumps to present day and the mother / son dynamic fighting the good cause.The double crossing 'friend' who is a relation to the original enemy of Adam from 5000 years ago.A bunch of thugs who have teleporting hover bikes (just because)The hero getting injured (although he could heal himself instantly) in order to connect with the family.The hero subsequently having to question his own motives.A bunch of other heroes to battle with and fill the required Superhero quota.The creation of a new 'Big Bad' just in time for the finale.And it gets worse. Marvel and DC in particular were known for stealing each others characters and creating their own versions. This movie takes it one step further with The Justice Society Heroes being too much like rejects from the Marvel movies. Hawkman is too much like Falcon, Atom Smasher is a mash up of Deadpool & Ant-Man, Doctor Fate is Doctor Strange which makes the film feel second rate.Add to that the thin acting a typical, repetitive story, awful nonsensical editing & direction and the overuse of comedic one liners and CGI to fill in the cracks and you have Black Adam.","6/10"
"Black Adam","ethanbresnett","27 October 2022","Black Adam is not as good as some people would have you believe, but it definitely isn't as bad as some others would have you believe. It's a very average film with plenty of flaws but some decent moments.Firstly there's the performance from The Rock. He's just The Rock. As he is in every film. He's not a bad actor, but he's very one note and doesn't have the ability to get lost in a role and truly sell it. It's a fine performance though, full of bravado and he fills the screen and looks the part.The comedy is a mixed bag. I did find myself chuckling a few times for my sins, but some of it really didn't land (I'm looking at you Atom Smasher).The action isn't the best. There are some cool moments but they quickly become repetitive and it never really excited me. The final act had a couple of neat set pieces but was mostly derivative of the genre, and doesn't treat new ground at all.For the most part the script is pretty cliche and tired. It tries to have something interesting to say about imperialism and foreign powers interfering in other countries, but then casts an American in the lead role which feels very shortsighted and undermines what could have been an interesting angle.Perhaps my biggest gripe with this film is the ridiculously excessive exposition through flashbacks and narration. It absolutely butchers the pacing of the film and makes for a very disorienting watch at times.Black Adam is a perfectly fine watch, but it's not a film I'll likely return to. The flaws are glaring and the good moments are too few and far between.","6/10"
"Black Adam","jace_the_film_guy","21 October 2022","Big and loud, ""Black Adam"" is exactly what you would expect from a superhero - or anti-hero - movie starring Dwayne Johnson. The action sequences are impressive, which fits the bill for the DCEU. The result is surprisingly graphic (shades of ""Multiverse of Madness"") compared to most other films in the genre. Like most modern superhero movies, there is some forced humor, but not too much.Some of the best scenes are the introduction to Kahndaq (the main setting) and flashbacks to 2,600 BC. The story is also surprisingly grounded and contained in one location for the most part. While it is difficult to relate to a character as indestructible as Black Adam, the stakes were low enough to garner some investment.Dwayne Johnson does a fine job of embodying the titular character, but the rest of the cast is lackluster. The supporting heroes needed more depth or to have been left out. There were some moments where a strong emotional reaction was warranted, but a lack of character development left me disconnected.With a runtime right at 2 hours, the film tackles the source material effectively. That being said, the second act leaned heavier on explosions and fight scenes than character growth. There were moments reminiscent of Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" movies, which is both a compliment and a frustration. Ultimately, when a hero is indestructible, overly powerful, and God-like, it is difficult to connect, which is this movie's biggest flaw.""Black Adam"" is one of the stronger entries in the DCEU, especially compared to ""Dawn of Justice"" and ""Justice League"". The film took its time building up to the inevitable which caused the plot to drag a bit, but it has recognizable identity. The last few months have lacked tentpole films, and this movie fills that void.Best Character: Amon
Best Scene: The mid-credit scene
Best Quote: ""I'm not peaceful. Nor do I surrender."" - Black Adam
Best Piece of Score: Teth-Adam.","1/10"
"Black Adam","camilogilmouzo","24 October 2022","This is one of the worst superhero movies ever made. The story is extremely basic, the characters are very topical, a self-parody, a combative mom, a son who pretends to be cool, but skateboards around like he's Bart Simpson (the 90's were long ago, man) an uncle fat guy who drives a van and is the easy comic resource... We didn't like all the protagonists, everyone, from the heroes to the villains, was too stupid, really. And the jokes are for young children, but with so many violent deaths, it is not a children's film.I don't know who wrote the script, but I bet on the producer's 14-year-old nephews, after having smoked a little marijuana. They wrote the script in less than the length of the movie, and they never revised it.I went to the movies with several friends and we all thought the same thing, that we had lost a couple of hours of our lives. Please don't do the same. Life is short.I didn't leave the cinema, but because I was sitting in the central seats and I didn't want to disturb people.","5/10"

"Black Adam","arungeorge13","26 November 2022","A film that's supposed to play out as an anti-hero origin story comes across as a series of flashy set-pieces knit together by an extremely thin and dispassionate plot. It's clear from the very first scene that director Jaume Collet-Serra (well-known for his Liam Neeson actioners) is only interested in making the film look great with his stylistic choices and not dig into the meat of the lead characters. The Justice Society makes an appearance (with only Brosnan managing to leave a mark purely due to his charisma) although these scenes do nothing except create empty (yet beautiful) spectacle.If there's one achievement the writers managed with Black Adam, it is in portraying the titular character as unpredictable. He could definitely sway either way, but heck, give him less generic lines whenever he speaks, maybe? Johnson speaks comparatively less in the film, and he isn't able to bring anything unique to the role other than his staggering physique. I'd rate it almost as bad as David Ayer's Suicide Squad, with most characters not clicking, and an antagonist that's best not discussed in detail. The Superman cameo in the mid-credits raises hopes a little.","5/10"
"Black Adam","thajudheen","27 November 2022","In the first few minutes after Black Adam is introduced, he takes on a dozen or so elite soldiers and comes out on top. Naturally, the soldiers call in backup to throw everything, and Adam takes them out in a slow-mo sequence. (If this was an attempt to recreate the fun sequences with X-Men's Quicksilver, it falls flat.)Now that we have established that our lead is indestructible, where do we go? The screenwriters seem to have to settled for an approach to go everywhere and see what works. So we follow a few secondary characters ending up in mortal peril, a city that's been under oppressive leadership for years (millennia, apparently), an ancient artifact, the 'Justice Society', Adam's own backstory etc.What results is a movie that's just tolerable to watch. Action sequences are aplenty, but with an indestructible hero, there are no stakes to talk about. The secondary characters fail to leave any mark on the story, and the emotional beats don't land well.There are a few good things about the movie: Adam's origin story is interesting and comes with a few twists. The action sequences, despite the lack of stakes as noted above, are still fun. The post-credits scene sets up the next movie, which promises to be an interesting watch.","2/10"

"Black Adam","uncleoyster","26 November 2022","This thing had much going for it, at least in the idea department, and it could have been great. Sadly, it fails on too many fronts. For all its good ideas, it's honestly just too clumsily done. The incompetence on display is surprising at this level of blockbuster moviemaking. This is B grade stuff.For starters, the screenplay needed at least two more passes. Flesh out the characters, not just the set pieces. Finesse the dialogue. Have them interact believably. Make us care! For one, the movie fails to balance its tone, which makes the small attempts at comedy fall flat. And sadly, the character Hawkman comes off as severely stupid. Every action he takes, every word he utters, only serves to escalate the conflict and further endanger the people they claim to protect. At one point I was sure I was watching Team America. Thus, his implied friendship with Fate comes off as unearned - Fate would never suffer such foolishness. When I don't believe the characters I get taken straight out of the movie, and it's so hard to engage afterwards.Speaking of Fate... How very dareyou kill off my favourite character in his very first movie? Unnecessary. Unearned. Unbelievable.The director should be replaced. We see what he's going for, but as implied earlier he's not competent enough to accomplish any of it. The scope here should be vast and the stakes should feel massive, but instead we don't care and the flick looks and feels small and unengaging.The storytelling here is very rushed. We skip from location to location with no room for the characters to breathe. We never get to know them, and so nothing they do really matters. Pierce Brosnan at least tries to make his meager material work, oh how he tries, but the flick just won't let him. It's frustrating to watch.Dwayne is sorely miscast in any role that requires depth of character. That dude is a movie star, not an actor.I won't harp too much on the CG stuff, we know those guys are underpaid and overworked, and they never have enough time to make a solid product. That said, the Final Boss™ looked laughably bad and I blame the studio and producers.Even the music is generic and lacklustre.

"Black Adam","kjproulx","3 November 2022","Besides the living Hollywood legends, as far as Blockbusters go, Dwayne Johnson is one of the only names out there that will draw a crowd. These days, it's all about the spectacle or whether or not a good story is enough to pull people in. The way of the Hollywood star is going away, but Johnson is one of the few keeping that notion alive. I'm saying this because I don't think this film would be getting as much attention without him in the leading role, and I also don't think I would've enjoyed it as much without this particular cast. Here's why, although it's a mess, you may get some enjoyment out of Black Adam, as I did.Imprisoned for over 5,000 years, a man named Teth Adam is unleashed on the world. The Justice Society, a team of superpowered individuals, is on the hunt for him when they find this out, but more significant threats will take precedence. Having the powers of the Egyptian Gods, Teth Adam begins to tear apart and kill anyone who stands against him. This was his moral code back in the day and still remains. The fish-out-of-water scenarios are what made this film enjoyable though.Dwayne Johnson plays a more stoic version of his beloved persona and I thought it worked well here. On top of that, I thought the additions of Aldis Hodge (Hawkman), Pierce Brosnan (Dr. Fate), Noah Centineo (Atom Smasher), and Quintessa Swindell (Cyclone) as the Justice Society were all great and played off each other well. It was the fact that I loved all the characters that left me overall enjoying this film. The biggest issue is that it moves very quickly and tells two films' worth of story in about two hours. There was no room for anything to breathe.In the end, I'm not complaining about the pace of the film because that's the furthest thing from the problem. It moves at a very solid pace, but The Justice Society comes basically out of nowhere and because I liked all the characters so much throughout this film, I really wish we had a film or series that fleshed them out more. Great characters with zero backstories are just frustrating. It's filled with great superhero action and Dwayne Johnson is very good in the role, and Jaume Collet-Serra did a great job directing an exciting film, but I do feel that the writers just stuffed too much into a film that felt small-scale in terms of scope and locations. By no means a great movie, but if you're looking for some fun action that you can enjoy some popcorn with, this is it.","4/10"

They try a few comic moments that failed utterly There was literally NOTHING likable about any of these characters. DC just showed again how they will forever be chasing Marvel with no hope of catching them. Even The Rock couldnt save this steaming pile of feces because it was so pathetic.

"Black Adam","ryan-44110","19 November 2022","One of DC's better anti-heroes unfortunately gets the same treatment as Snyder's Justice League. I presume originally a 4hr long movie, reduced to 2hrs and leaving most of the audience who likely doesn't have any insight or prior knowledge of the Justice Society, Dr. Fate, Hawkman, etc clueless as to who comprises the protagonist mash up. Johnson does a good job of conveying the internal struggle and motivation of Teth Adam, but the film doesn't do a good job of explaining how he and Shazam both exist at the same time in the same universe. It also doesn't explain who bestowed the power to the wizards to be given to a champion. We're dumped in a timeline 5000 years ago, and told about a mythical location in dire straits by an oppressive ruler. That bleeds over to modern day to set up our villain arc. Going by the comics, we should've at least had some interaction or plot with Egyptians and their gods, but nada. Major let down.Leading us head first into plot, we're given the Justice Society, which may as well be the Justice league of B-list heroes. Pretty underwhelming. If you don't know Dr. Fate and company, you're going to be confused. There's little to no backstory on them or their previous adventures, or their reason for being. There's also no reason given as to why the Justice League isn't the one responding to the crisis either. The child actor in this is awful. His voice is terrible, especially when he shouts, acting is not convincing, and I was hoping they'd take him off screen for an extended period, but he was with us pretty much the whole way. Was this the best child actor they could find...?Best part about the whole movie? Johnson never once does the eyebrow thing in this movie, thankfully.All in all, good action flick, borderline gore but maintains its PG-13 rating. The best part is the end credits scene. Personally, a sequel isn't needed.","3/10"
"Black Adam","JayWolfgramm","24 January 2023","""Black Adam"" is a film that had a lot of production problems. Dwayne Johnson was cast in the role back when he still had hair and looked just like the comic book character. Sometimes this can just be a little side note for the movie. In this case, it is obvious in the final film that the script was written 16 years ago.By 2022, we have a LOT of options when it comes to superhero movies and ""Black Adam"" does nothing new to make it stand out from the bunch. Maybe when the script was written in 2007 these ideas seemed novel, but by now it is all derivative of other films that do it better.I will give the film this: I actually think it balances its humor better than the recent Marvel movies. The film has a fair number of jokes, but they are all character-based jokes and they fit within the tone the film has set. Pierce Brosnan and Dwayne Johnson have a fun dynamic and they work well off of each other. At least for the most part, there are several jokes that don't land. But in general, I thought the side characters could get a few good laughs and were engaging for the screen time they got.The storyline hinges on some pretty big plot holes they hope the audience ignores. The whole central conflict between Black Adam and the Justice Society could be settled with a simple 3 second conversation. Why would they have an issue with him killing bad guys, when in this DC world ALL the superheroes go around killing bad guys?This is another film that does not understand how to do villain centric stories. In this film, Black Adam is not a villain, or even an antihero, he is just a hero who keeps saying ""I'm not a hero.""The action is well helmed at times, but it is the simple conversation scenes that the editor feels compelled to cut to pieces. The action scenes themselves ring hollow because no punch does any damage to Black Adam. They can throw him through as many buildings as they want, it doesn't get a scratch on him. They introduce a weakness for him, but never have it come up in any of the fights.Any goodwill the movie had going for it, is lost in the final act. It unravels down to the same old DC CGI battle with a stupid underdeveloped villain. And to top things off, they include a post-credit tease that is never going to pay off. Throughout the film, Black Adam feels the wizards gave the power to the wrong man. The wizards may not have chosen the wrong man, but I have chosen the wrong movie.","1/10"
"Black Adam","lnorrbyln","28 December 2022","I did not like this movie and was surprised that The Rock would be acting in a very onedimensional role. I had colleagues telling me that watching this movie would be a waste of time - I didn't believe them at first but now I can confirm they were right.Even though hero movies (Marvel etc) are ""over the top"" with the super powers and all, this film lacked the refined touch and depth of those movies.I had the feeling that The Rock didn't actually want to take part in this movie but had to because he was bound by some contract or something. His usual energy and ""presence"" (if you get what I'm trying to express) was somehow missing.Maybe just a feeling but that is my impression.","3/10"
"Black Adam","theredsky","20 November 2022","This felt like a bad video game. The Rock is a very charismatic guy but I don't have a clue why he hyped this up as a game changer for the DCU. It's the most bland Superhero film of the year. No one here feels adequately developed with the exception of Black Adam himself but even then his development is very surface level. I think what annoys me most about this movie is that there is a good film hidden here. This film talks about Superheros coming in and invading places for the sake of ""peace"". That's a really cool idea that should be developed more in Superhero movies but it isn't here. Here it's a throwaway line which definitely annoyed me because it means the writers saw the opportunity and decided not to develop it. The performances are okay. The Rock is just being The Rock which is charming enough and Pierce Brosnan is definitely making an attempt here with the script he was given. Everyone else is fine. Their powers and abilities are cool but they would be cooler if their characters weren't so surface level. The visual effects look like they come out of a PS2 or PS3 however it definitely feels like the VFX artists were crunched for time. There's also a tone problem here. Sometimes the film likes to mimic Zack Snyder's style and sometimes it tries to mimic James Gunk's comedy. They don't mix together well here though because neither of those individuals worked on this movie. The villain here sucks. Honestly, having Black Adam have beef with the Justice Society worked decently well but they just had to throw in a stereotypical CGI 3rd act villain and it doesn't work at all. I can't even remember the villains name. Unless you really care about these characters or the DCU in general then I would avoid this.","8/10"

"Black Adam","BoredMovieWatcher","8 February 2023","Black Adam is that superhero movie that you just watch for the hell of it. But once I finished watching this movie, I just forgot all about it. There isn't much to this movie other than to satisfy your craving for action and superhero fight sequences.The problem with Black Adam is that this feels like it's trying to copy the MCU winning formula. It tries to land at humor but can't because of Dwane Johnson's emotionless acting or just feels out of place and forced. And the character himself, Black Adam is just not super interesting. He's that character with no inherent weaknesses nor any emotions that make us like the character. But I can say I liked the other characters in the film, like Doctor Fate and Hawkman. Everyone else in the film was uninteresting that they're only there for filling in roles.I can only say that Black Adam is alright in the action and the side heroes that show up, but the rest of the movie is lacking one thing that makes superhero movies great: character development. And no, having a flashback scene to tell the origin of Black Adam does not count as character development.","10/10"
"Black Adam","marioalvarezpineda","22 October 2022","I really do think that it has become a Trend to hate on DC even when they give us an amazing movie. Black Adam was truly the superhero movie I needed after feeling superhero fatigue from all the Marvel movies and series. D. J. Portrayed Black Adam to perfection. He was born for this role. From start to finish the Special Effects, the plot, the action scenes and the acting was on point. It had me at the edge of my seat. Non stop action and non stop heroes. They really got the formula right on this one. It opened up the DC universe to so many opportunities that I am sure (if done right) will surpass all our expectations. Thank you D. J. for this movie. It is a must watch for superhero fans.","3/10"

They keep doing it over and over. Over and over. See what I did there? That's this movie. The same components from other movies reused over and over. Every character was a cardboard cutout. Their ""personality"" was obvious and the dialogue predictable. And the plot was even more predictable then the dialogue. Where have I seen this plot before... in every other comic book movie and many other movies. Also, even commercials have CGI now. CGI has become passé and boring. CGI does not make a movie good. The entertainment industry is kaput. All the music sounds the same. All the movies are the same. All the shows are the same...well most of them. Wednesday was decent. This movie was not.","10/10"
"Black Adam","Kazombie","21 October 2022","Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson gets top marks for making his Black Adam just as steely and imposing as in the DC comics.There are tons of action scenes featuring the Justice Society, obviously. Cyclone's beautiful twisters are a unique joy to watch and they add some welcome color to the film's visual palette. You can finally see Doctor Fate on screen and see how the other comic brand has ripped off and created a woke and weaker version in the form of the DS.Black Adam indulges to the perfect point where it's hard not to enjoy the DC anti-hero's debut. It's packed with fleshed out characters and an excessive number of adrenalin pumping action scenes, to the point where it outclasses any other outing and shows what it means to be a hero even in the midst of all the noise. DC has managed to capture lightning in a bottle and Black Adam manages to find its spark and then some.My previous positive reviews for DC films get rejected. Anything negative about other brands also get rejected. Who is moderating these reviews??Two final words: Post credit! Excellent return for the DCEU. Welcome home indeed!","5/10"
"Black Adam","ashfordofficial","22 November 2022","For a ""superhero"" movie with lots of action and comic book references, Black Adam is decent and somewhat entertaining. But as for a $195-200 million movie, it is flawed in many ways. 50% bad CGI negated 50% good CGI, weak and clueless direction, amateurish writing, some of the actors and their performances and dialogue delivery were weak and uninteresting. A mishmash storytelling that got tangled up in extreme weirdness. Poor music choices in important moments and the sound editing and mixing department ruined a lot scenes and broke the immersion. If this movie had a visionary director and a good screenwriter the outcome would've been very much different and I'm talking about the poor reviews and the disappointing box-office performance.","2/10"

I usually think Dwayne Johnson can liven any old mediocre hollywood hokum up, but not here ... Whatever he says about really wanting to make this for years, he looks like he is really hating every minute of it and can tell its a total train wreck of a film ... Nothing new ... Not entertaining in any way ... Just pointless as its all been done before years ago and much better ... Why bother to keep on making these things and think you can cover up the failings in a script that sounds it was written by some kid that's been thrown out of English class for a complete lack any understanding of structure, narrative or basic language or story arcs, with CGI ... This film is one of the worst I have seen in a long time ... There really are fewer less interesting ways to spend your time ...

No one does. No one seems to know if they're supposed to be comedic or dramatic, but either way it doesn't work. It's tried too hard to be a Marvel style film, as I could not for one moment imagine this film coexisting in a world with Gotham City.There's way too much filler, stupid side characters who are also just filler, no depth to make you care if anyone lives or dies or not, and a stupid post movie scene of ""Now you bother showing up?""For a film that's been talked about for so long now, the Rock has just embarrassingly laid the smackdown on himself,checked himself into the rock bottom hotel and can spend his millions of dollars as tissues as he is awarded most pathetic super hero of the year.Oprah sets up a hint at a sequal in the end, but I won't be surprised if DC just scrap this films idea as a franchise all together.","4/10"

Well, Marvell films lately have gone down the tube so much recently I don't even watch them any more. This was similarIf you are a massive Rock fan you will watch this no matter what. I'm the same but I feel the older the Rock is getting the more I tire of him. Particular now he has put so much emphasis on bulking up. It's not a good look. His body is no longer no proportional. He has put too much effort in his chest and this is massive but his lower body is small. A bit like watching a Rod Stewart on steroids. I think Ryan Reynolds would have been a better fitI did not like the story and this film was no different to any other super hero film coming out recently.Nothing special.

"Black Adam","Snootz","19 November 2022","If you're looking for constant, never-stops action, a high body count, a typical Dwayne Johnson character that's exactly like all other characters he plays, and a hefty hunk of Satanism thrown in (at the very end, to make sure everyone is already hooked), this is the movie for you.I'm sure there are a lot of comic boys and The Rock fans who will just love this movie. But seriously, the director didn't make any effort at all to give Johnson a chance to portray a different character than he always plays.The story is ho hum and highly predictable. The redeeming factor is that we get to see characters we don't ordinarily see: Doctor Fate, Cyclone, a really kick-tail Hawkman, and Atom Smasher (well, we've seen a giant Ant Man before, but this is uh... different).The CGI of course is incredible. The story isn't stoopid, so there's that. But it's also not very impressive. We went in expecting a comic book movie, and that's what we got.I had been hoping for something a little different, an anti-hero that gave a different feel to the whole film. But Dwayne simply can't help being fun and charming. I was expecting a character that makes Batman look tame, but nope. Typical super hero flick (oh wait, we can't forget ""I'm not a super hero"").Ah well, it's another fix for the adrenaline junkies. ; )","3/10"

Dwayne Johnson As Black Adam was an absolute perfect casting with his performance being spectacular. The action and cinematography were amazing. The acting was alright as some characters nailed it and others didn't (THE BOY). Hawkman kinda stole the movie for me. His character arc from viewing the world as black and white or good and evil, to a more moderate viewpoint was interesting. His dynamic with Doctor Fate was the best part of the movie.Now for the downsides the action scenes were pretty good but felt dragged out. The constant cuts to slo mo didn't help either. The acting especially for the kid and his mother was mediocre. Overall a B Tier movie.","6/10"
"Black Adam","jonathanmarklund","22 November 2022","Black Adam is by no means a great movie, but it is far better than I thought it would be. I was expecting something along the lines of 'Ant Man' or 'Shazam'. But Adam has more depth too it then just a side-character's origin story. It actually has an identity of it's own, and much of this is due to the actors doing a really good job.The CGI is ""okay"". The rendering is good, but the physics and the animation is a bit stiff. I think another 2-3 months in development would have done this movie good.But other than that, I think it's a solid movie. You don't need to be a hardcore nerd to follow the plot and you don't need to watch every DC movie that came before it to enjoy this (thank God for that.)So yeah, get some popcorn, lower your expectations, and just watch a superhero movie.","8/10"

They were bearable.I liked the storyline, liked most of the characters, but I have to say the so called super heroes.....not particularly great on any level. It does kind of feel like the film industry is scraping the bottom of the barrel for 'another super hero'.

The only saving grace is the unending, and effortless charisma of Pierce Brosnan, which doesn't say much as the man can simply exist in a room, and I would be mildly entertained for an hour or two.I have more or less forgotten the plot to the film. The ending was patently insane, inept and un-understandable.The acting is wooden and stiff, and the dialog is absolutely the worst.The Rock, the otherwise funny and charismatic ""dude"" does not work as an angry and brooding man. He simply does not fit the character of Black Adam. In fact, Black ""Teth"" Adam, is a very poorly written brooding dark evil person. His motivations are strange, his intentions are completely unknown.He's just pushed around by the plot. Climax happens, because ""plot"" and the movie ends.It's not good.Go spend your money on a really good movie, like Bullet Train or Top Gun Mav.3/10.","4/10"

I genuinely think the casting is inspired for most characters, and you can see the ghost of what could have been a truly great performance by mr johnson but sadly the direction fails to make anything out of it. I have to assume this was constructed by committee and as such dont want to put all the blame for the failures on any one part of the production team but the final product never amounts to more than the some of its parts and each of those parts feels like it was pulled from a different movie. In the end the parts that work keep it watchable if you turn your brain off and dont listen to like 90 percent of the dialogue.","5/10"

"Black Adam","finetunes","22 November 2022","1st time I watched the movie I dozed off in a couple of places and, of course, that could explain my confusion after the movie was over. Who was this group of superheroes fighting Black Adam? I must have fallen asleep when they were properly introduced; I barely caught there names. The plot seemed to explode with world building and even more world building, couldn't they have come up with a story with less padding of details? The writer and director tried to pack a trilogy into one movie. Again I blamed my lapses into sleep so I watched it again, and again I fell asleep but in different sections. I tried to put it all together but do I blame my falling asleep for not grasping this movie or do I blame the incomprehensibleness for putting me to sleep?Something else and very important - the movie gave off a weird vibe - who were the good guys and who were the bad guys, they all seemed a bit unlikeable.It's one thing to give a movie novel plot twists and unique characters but it takes creativity and inventiveness to come up with something likeably new. I wish I knew how to underline ""likeably"". One day I'll give this movie another chance and see how right or wrong I was on this review. Maybe there needs to be a 4 hour Zak Snyder's cut to fix this mess of a movie. It was poor storytelling.P. S. I just looked up the director on IMDB - he directed Jungle Cruise??? How could they let him direct a huge budget movie like Black Adam after directing a mediocre movie like Jungle Cruise.?? I'd sure like to know the decision-making process behind that.","2/10"

"Black Adam","and-46245","17 December 2022","I can't imagine why adults would enjoy this. I stopped watching this about 20 minutes into the movie, I didn't check the timer though.Why did I stop there? Well, that's when the movie has two characters talk to each other in a hilariously awful exposition dialogue where the one guy tells the other a brief backstory and intel on each of the people picked for a team that they want to use. These are things you'd imagine they'd already know or have communicated through some other means other than their Skype call, but this scene is entirely about telling the viewer ""Here are our these characters and this is their gimmick"".There's no real build-up, there's barely any establishing of characters. We have magical mystics exclaim ""SHAZAM!"" and everything about the movie takes this 100% seriously.Every now and then something has to happen for some convoluted, forced quip that really doesn't fit the situation, from characters who are NOT reacting like they should to absolutely crazy things happening to them.I feel like all of this would be acceptable if the movie didn't take itself so seriously whilst at the same time it tries to mimic other movies. I could tell you exactly what it takes from other movies and why it does that, but that'd be spoilers. No doubt if you've watched all the superhero movies there are you will notice it as well. Some might call it ""homage"", but when every other scene seems to be something like this it becomes derivative.The notion that this movie somehow manages to do ""explorations of morality"" or have any kind of deeper meaning is to me quite laughable.","9/10"

It feels like a project driven by marketers and data analytics with the only goal of trying to make enough noise (with big-name actors, busy VFX, and cheap jokes) to make viewers expend time and money on an experience they will forget as soon as the movie wrap up. It's pathetic how this studio has lost their way and his brand trying to chase the success that other studios has found. We need more artist, more soul, and risk and less marketing BS!!","3/10"
"Black Adam","thePopcornExplorer","2 January 2023","I have to confess that my expectations weren't that high considering the type of movies DC have been launching for the past years, but this one just makes it official to me; I will no longer see any more DC films for the next couple years until a major shift is made...I don't even know where to start to be honest, a movie that relies 95% of its runtime in CGI, with a highly superficial plot that introduces tons of characters and develops none of them, the boring, predictable, unfunny dried out super hero humor that filmmakers insist on doing, a fast pace rhythm that allows for zero realism and connection to the story, the uncharismatic set of actors, the Rock being the Rock for the 100th time in a movie, the fact that it treats murdering people with such a soft and senseless approach....The list goes on and on, I will make it short, it's a generic, boring, predictable super hero movie with a plot from the early 2000s a decent soundtrack and CGI that makes it of easy consumption, in short, a cash grabbing mindless movie that will make you lose a few braincells and worst of all 2 hours of your time.I don't enjoy being harsh on films and I rarely give low scores so that is why I am making the conscience decision of stop watching DC since the lowest scores for past years have all been from DC who got their script ideas stuck in time. And how is the Rock so popular...? I don't get it, I have nothing against him there's a clear audience for his movies but I just don't see the appeal, he is okay but he is literally the same character in every single film...","3/10"

"Black Adam","mrashtastic89","22 October 2022","Black Adam is exactly what I expected, a mediocre movie from a terrible movie universe, I am a fan of DC but not of the DCEU, they never fail to unimpress me with a few exceptions, but this was not of the exception.The fact Black Adam apparently took 15 years to make and this was the final result is just sad, the best way to describe this film is if you gave a mediocre script to Michael Bay, and if he directed it.Black Adam pretty much puts all of it's focus on the mediocre and way too drawn out action scenes, and when it's not doing that it gives us terrible character development, heaps of exposition, and a terribly forgettable villain.Not even the post credits could save this movie from being anything but a painfully average DC movieI'm gonna give Black Adam a C-","8/10"

"Black Adam","salman_film_guy","4 December 2022","I'll give it you straight: the movie felt less like a superhero movie and more like Dwayne's dream to star as a superhero. There. I said it.Weak world-building, non-sensical action (how does this guy even know how to use a grenade immediately after awakening from 5000 years of sleep?) and wayyyy too much slow-mo that looks like it's a middle schooler's rip-off off Marvel's amazing quicksilver scenes. The cast seems unable to exhibit real emotion and the dialogue is cringe. None of the character's choices or motivations make sense. The 'story' seems like it's just there to find a way to add one uninspiring action sequence after another. The CGI is good, but pales in comparison to other Marvel or DCU films. There is little suspension of disbelief.Don't get me wrong, I really like Dwayne Johnson but he's better off starring as a co-star in a jungle themed comedy thriller with Kevin Hart rather than a superhero.","2/10"

Maybe it gets better later on, but the initial story and acting and characters were so uninspiring that I wouldn't want to check out if it improves.Part of the problem is certainly me - if I don't want to see the typical superhero blabber about magical mystical super stuff, I shouldn't do that - but the other part is it's being made and wrapped in an appealing trailers to disguise it as this-one-is-definitely-not-yet-another-generic-superhero-story...Ugh.","7/10"

Next thing you know the Calvary pulls up. And you know by the Calvary I mean Superman.So what the Man of Steel say? Well he said to Black Adam, ""Lets chop it up.""

Amazing and fantastic effects like one the best effects I have ever seen however there were many time were I couldn't hear the actors lines over the music and that's one of the reasons why I was confused with this movie! Who ever did the sound editing for the music, did not do a good job!If you all are a huge fan of amazing beautiful effects and fantastic slow motion explosions and you just don't care about the story in the movie then this is the movie for you!There was only one part that I liked with his movie and that is when Black Adam (Dwayne Johnson) was talking about his son saving his life.","4/10"

How, do you take so many good actors and force them to deliver this horrendously childish, simpleminded nonsense. So, so bad.These three writers should never be allowed to do another comic hero film again. They think it has to be stupid kind of action for anyone to watch it, when in fact the opposite is true. The script must be better and tighter to be good comic book action, and they clearly don't understand that.The only person who truly did well in this was the editor who cut the trailer, because she/he truly fooled us into believing that this wasn't absolute and complete trash!I still have 300 characters to use, but why bother. Dwayne Johnson and Danni Garcia should have known better, Aldis Hodge should have known better, and apparently Jaume Collet-Serra the Director, was not ready for comic action hero kind of adventure. Bad, bad, bad.After watching the glorious Three Thousand Years of Longing, all I could feel is sorry for this cast, the costume designer, set designer, Sarah Shahi and Pierce Brosnan and for having to do this toward the end of his career.Come on Rock, please do better.

You better give attention in the movie.All the other participants got their moments and please note here: it is an entertaining hero movie and not a drama based on real events. So shut up and enjoy the fantasy action.I gave the movie 10 stars because i think i have to compensate all the unfair rated bad reviews here.

"Black Adam","vavilondun","24 October 2022","Is it a kinda fun movie? Well, actually it is fun to find the scenes that this movie stole from the other superheroic ones. Like X-Mansion with an X-Jet under the X-clusive-basketball-area. Fate is a Dr Strange clone with his future-oriented powers just like Strange did with his Eye of Agamotto in Infinity War, plus at one point he really repeating after Strange ""on fingers"" casting some magic, plus he multiply himself to catch Thanos... Oops not Thanos, a completely different villain. Plus he got one close face-scene like an Iron Man armor inside view. What else? Slow Mo tribute to Quiksilver included. What else? A single and a strong woman in trying of saving her son giving an orders to superhumans and they obey cause they all met like 2 minutes ago, there's no option to say NO! 0_0. What else? Flying away ashes of a destroyed something but it's confetti here. What else? An Ant-Man clone... WHAT ELSE? When I saw Justice Society at the very first time in this movie they really took me back to 1999 when I was a kid sitting in a front of an old and fat TV watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series where was Captain America and some no-name squad for no reason of adding them there instead of Avengers. See? Justice League should be here, Superman vs Black Adam, not The Funny & Bad Illustrated Devil vs Black Adam! Well, maybe in some other realities. But the movie is fun, yeah. I laughed.","5/10"
"Black Adam","crom-dubh","17 December 2022","I am mostly a pretty big fan of Johnson, and I know this was a kind of passion project for him, so despite some superhero fatigue and generally feeling like the DCU films tend to be mediocre at best, I was sort of looking forward to this. What I got was more or less what I probably should have expected: another badly written and tonally uneven CGI extravaganza.The backstory that we're given here feels rushed and muddled, but I still felt some hope that when Black Adam was introduced that things would pick up. In his first real scene you can tell they tried very hard to emphasize the brutality of which he's capable, but they must have overexerted themselves, because the rest of the film feels pretty sanitized by comparison. The marketing and expository dialog all suggests that this is supposed to be darker and morally ambiguous, but it ended up feeling just like more of the same.The actual plot is incredibly clumsy. The conflict that's set up between the Justice Society and Black Adam is forced and legitimately nonsensical. They basically just needed someone for him to fight before the real villain finally shows up, because the ordinary human baddies are obviously no real threat to him. I think the film suffers from having given us no real backstory for any of these characters, because they are uninteresting, hollow, and badly acted. Even Pierce Brosnan doesn't get much to work with here, and the lessons that should have been learned from Wonder Woman about putting an old dude inside a CGI costume went unheeded. Suffice it to say, the Justice Society just ends up being mostly an annoyance here.And speaking of annoying, it's been a while since I've seen a film with more obnoxious expository dialog throughout the entire film that attempts to remind us what the themes are supposed to be. Count how many times they say the word ""hero,"" how many times they mention that Adam ""can't be a hero"" or ""isn't a hero"" blah blah blah. There are so many moments where the film undermines itself by demonstrating that it can't even trust the audience to figure this stuff out for themselves.I'm somewhat generously rating this a 5, and a bit surprised at how positively some people seem to have received this, because it's really very bland. If you've seen even a few of the superhero films in recent years leading up to this, I can't imagine not finding this really predictable and even boring. I hate to say it because Johnson's involvement in a project usually means that it will at least be fun and exciting to watch, but I didn't really feel much of anything watching this.","3/10"
"Black Adam","ladypenelopefrontbum","11 February 2023","Didn't feel like it had any direction at all. Good fight scenes though. The story seemed to get lost in itself and characters introduced didn't really seem relevant, it also had a sub plot that didn't really need to be there. Probably wouldn't recommend to or pay for it like I did, now they've rebooted this would probably be a waste of time to watch for the timeline, DC just doesn't seem to work well in cinema unless it's Batman, consistently trying to copy marvel and failing. A new formula needs to be created for the superhero films to pull people in, this followed the same has powers, gave up powers, got powers back and won. Bit boring.","2/10"

"Black Adam","acevibrant","22 October 2022","I think the Rock did a good job portraying Black Adams character a man torn apart inside. The storyline was pretty decent had a nice twist to it. Typical character development where the protagonist dislikes everyone in the world but develops a bond with this one random lucky kid but lol. The fight scenes were excellent! Especially his fights with Hawkman. Hawkman is a true brawler. I think they could have done a lot better with Doctor Fate, I would have liked to see him in more fight scenes. Other scenes were a little cliche trying to add humor but it wasn't too bad. Overall decent movie for Rocks debut role in the DC universe. His character is definitely a screen presence for any future appearances in DC films.","3/10"

It was ok at best, but he should have never been given a stand alone movie, he is an antagonist. He should have featured in Shazam or a Superman movie as the villain. No one in this movie even comes close to his power level until the post credits. The SFX are decent, and Pierce Brosnan is easily the best thing in it. If anything I would probably give him his own stand-alone tv show. The film feels like it should have been realised 15 years ago. It isn't a patch on the MCU or Cristian Bales Batman. Even Thor Love and Thunder was better.Save your money and wait till a quality stream comes out.","4/10"

They were able to fend off mercenaries and supernatural forces without breaking a sweat in order to save the city.

I had never heard of Black Adam before and would do fine if I never heard of him again. First of all, what an awful name for a superhero! The CGI was very artificial in appearance. The characters had no backstory or exposition. How did Black Adam not have an accent earlier in the movie but not later? It all made no sense as characters always ended up being in the right place at the right time with no other extras around. It was as if they were the only people on the planet! Continuous action with little plot. Black Adam needs to go back to sleep.","3/10"

But then again the rock a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson will do any movie roll because he's in love with himself more than himself is in love with herself in a loving self after loving himself more than Anyone else has loved him before and then he just loves himself even more after that because the rock is in love with himself soon to be he will marry himself and then divorce himself because he found himself a better himself.","6/10"
"Black Adam","craig-snell-151-149427","20 November 2022","But to be fair, that doesn't really make it a fantastic movie. I'd heard/read a lot about Black Adam and I really love Dwayne Johnson when he is playing a decent character.There are some good points to this film, pierce Brosnan was excellent, but he normally is, Hawkman was good as well, and Dwayne did play the role he was given quite well.What I didn't really like about the film had more to to with points that that actors could do very little about, The CGI was very clunky in bits, it seemed to jump through bits and most of the fights appeared to be very jerky as if the editor took out a couple of frames every second, and then thought to himself that no one would notice.There was predictably your paint by numbers superhero movie, feisty mother - check, kid who gets into trouble - check but redeems himself to save the day- check, new hero learning the ropes - check, possible romance between 2 characters down the line - check, I could go on and on, but I got bored writing it, so I'm sure so cannot be bothered to read it.To sum it up, it's good for the DCEU, and meh in the MCU.A lot of people were disappointed with the latest Thor offering, and this movie was a little better than that but it wasn't a patch on Shang-chi,In case you wondered in my humble opinion the other 4 best DCEU movies were (in order)Aquaman
The suicide squad (and it gave us the peacemaker series, which I loved)

Because every single little part has already been seen in the last 10-15 years... In fact, it's a movie for amnesiacs....It's basically a complete rip-off of countless recent superhero movies. It's so painfully obvious, over and over again... it feels like a collection of stolen scenes all rehashed into a new movie that lacks any originality, any personality... I mean, the jet lifting off the opening sport yard outside the mansion. COME ON. Total X-men plagiarism. And it's like that. All. The. Way.I am a big fan of Dwayne Johnson, he is generally so lovable, but even him cannot save this movie, and I'm sad to say that I found him even bad in the role, even though it's most certainly not his fault, but the role which is so badly written!Also, he looks more CGI than human, like he was being (...badly) photoshopped at every second.The whole bunch of completely unknown ""superheroes"" dropping out of nowhere felt so wrong, their proper introduction utterly failed (rip-off of Dr Strange in the Multiverse, and the kleenex team of ""superheroes"" facing Wanda just to die ridiculously? At least those were a decent prop...)Honestly it's the type of movie that makes you think we should really stop paying the slightest attention or giving a single cent to those studios, until they learn to respect their audience, and their staff - I cant believe a director or writer with any notion of self-respect would be content with this... crap... Except maybe Taika Cohen-Waititi...Speaking of which.... After Thor : love and thunder (but Black Adam was not *that* bad...), this was the second really lame superhero movie I've watched this year.

Movie Review (11/2022): ""Black Adam"" starring Dwayne Johnson, Pierce Brosnan, and Aldis Hodge.I didn't have much expectation for this DC Comic movie.. but holy cow, what a show!! It's an adventure/super hero type of movie with a ton of action. Johnson was great.. but Pierce Brosnan was awesome in his role as Dr. Fate. It's a cool movie because it's set in another land, but also starts in a different time. It's such an interesting movie because it just feels like it covers numerous genres of films.Acting was very good.. and no shortage of action.I'd give this a solid 7 out of 10 starts. Definitely a BIG screen movie!! See it on the big screen because it's visually exciting and deserves to be ""experienced""!While some people seem to rate a very good movie a 10 on IMDB (which always makes me wonder what a REAL film classic is if a movie like this is a 10), a 7 in my book is a very high rating.

"Black Adam","dorMancyx","24 October 2022","It's commercial action superhero movie time, which means don't take your brain to the theater! Ignore the ethics, ignore the logistics, just shut up and hype.Everything, I mean literally everything in the film, works up for the nonstop action sequences, which in themselves are absolutely mesmerizing, incredibly cinematic, and visibly money-burning. By employing slow motions, explosions, imaginative cinematography, plus the support of great costumes, choreography, and environmental layout, the movie captures the entirety of Black Adam's strength, speed, and brutality, as well as the specialties of other characters. Though the audience was acquainted with Shazam's identical abilities. Black Adam takes it to a higher level, as I legit climaxed (mentally) seeing the caped figure snatches the mercenary by his neck and melts him down to skeleton like ice cream. However, with the huge emphasis on action sequences, the film sacrifices a decent storyline, character dynamics, and essential moral, for even the short transitions are filled with dialogues that foreshadow the next combat. A lot more regarding anti-heroism, anti-fate, and anti-oppression could be exploited if the action sequences are of a fewer fraction. Demolishing the throne is indeed a forceful symbolism, but in-depth reasons are lacking.And if we're talking about Black Adam, we cannot avoid the actor that portrays it. Who else could present such muscular, semi-stern, semi-comic while extremely charismatic macho man other than Dwayne Johnson? Although his only expression are either ""dead serious looking at some distant statues"" or ""face twisted, yelling, teeth flared to show struggling"", the Rock performs his best at this level of a movie. My only complaint is that his suit looks too tight comparing to his big, fat, bald, rectangular head that seems humongous in the numerous close-ups.Anyway, definitely a thrilling superhero movie, and I look forward to having DCEU finally coming together.","4/10"
"Black Adam","brittanyfonseca","21 January 2023","Not the worst superhero movie ever...not the best either, by far.As a massive DC fan and big movie goer there were a few aspects of the film that I could appreciate, but rather few that I actually enjoyed. In fact, the prologue is a great example of what NOT to do--NEVER have voice over by one character at the same time others are speaking in a foreign language that requires subtitles. That's like Editing 101.It's just another anti-hero movie in a long line of superhero movies that neither challenge the genre, nor build upon it in any way. It also came at a time where I personally felt that the market was oversaturated with The Rock (even though I like him).","3/10"
"Black Adam","kotza1992","30 October 2022","The rock has to be the only actor who takes me entirely out of a film. The movie was ruined from the start when the rock is playing the same character with the same facial expressions and the same voice and employing no unique perspective required for an ancient super being. It seems like he's just come off the set of FF and is playing the same character despite Black Adam being a million times removed from the FF universe. I wanted to like the movie as I'm a massive superhero fan but it's almost impossible to with his performance and this script. There's no wonder why it's flopping hard and going to make less than the eternals (which sucked and was released during a pandemic) and Shazam.

I know I was completely wrong about the role played by Pierce Brosnan. Having said that I did not watch the trailer, I did not read anything about the movie ... although I did watch the Interview The Rock gave Jimmy Fallon ... and well I was ""prepared"" for the mid credit scene ... which felt almost like a disappointment to me. But that's a different story - well same story, but let's not really dive into that. And there is diving, but that is ... ok back to the movie but without any specifics, shall we? Rhetorical, please don't answer.The cast is a delight, the movie overall is quite serious - misses a few beats and jokes to say the least. And some jokes are just plain bad. A few work quite well though - sometimes the editing does not leave them enough space to breathe.The effects are ok, the story is overall predictable though. Even if you have not read anything about it. Also it uses tropes and cliches that may make you cringe at times ... by the way the plan of the human ""heroes"" is quite ... I am not sure if calling it bad would do it justice! Find something and then ... well nothing ... but as the movie tries to tell us: bad plans are better than no plans at all ... though there is no need to rush ... and there is no need to have ... I reckon I should go out and take breathe ... so many puns ... anyway, suspend your disbelief and it can work wonders. And this having a high score is quite the wonder ... Shazam indeed.","5/10"
"Black Adam","Thanos_Alfie","21 February 2023","""Black Adam"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a man with some extraordinary powers being freed from his tomb after 5,000 years. Soon enough he will seek revenge and justice in the modern world.I liked this movie but I have to say that I expected more from it. The plot was simple but interesting and it contained plenty of action that was well combined with mystery. The direction which was made by Jaume Collet-Serra was simple and did not make the difference although he presented very well his main characters and explained equally good the plot of the movie. The interpretations of Dwayne Johnson who played as Black Adam, Pierce Brosnan who played as Dr. Fate, Aldis Hodge who played as Hawkman and Noah Centineo who played as Atom Smasher were very good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Black Adam"" is a nice action movie but I expected more in terms of visual effects and direction.","2/10"
"Black Adam","OldMovieRob","17 February 2023","This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Bad enough that I got an hour into it and had to stop, for some very basic reasons: I didn't care about anyone in the film, namely the protagonist Black Adam (played by pro wrestler The Rock) who basically spends the entire film glaring and looking annoyed. The supporting crew? Who cares? And who on earth are the JSA? Are they like the Great Value Justice League? There was a glimmer of potential with the characters Hawkman and Doctor Fate, both of whom seemed like they could have been interesting characters to get to know, but the problem is, so much is going on, you don't get to really know any of these characters and you don't care about any of them. And what's the deal with the strange country in the desert where everything is cyan and orange, and how when a big bald flying guy shows up and destroys a few things, they all instantly think he's a hero. How did that happen so quickly? Wouldn't this take time to establish a hero narrative like that? The only positive, and the only reason I gave this turkey 2-stars instead of 1, was the post credit scene with Cavill as Superman, along with a few notes of the John Williams' motif. That alone was worthy of a star. The rest of the film, however, was hot garbage.","1/10"
"Black Adam","garabedian123","23 November 2022","How does the movie start? By focusing on a researcher/scientist/palentologist...Who want to find the crown...so they can keep it safe...to stop anyone else from finding it. IT was safe!...why find it to hide it? This makes no sense and is never explained.And the kid narrator.... Why? He is truly an awful narrator. We are led to believe he is Adam at first, but surprise...he isnt. So all that was for a twist...and for no actual story driven reason..How dumbIt tries to do too many things. IT tries to set up 2 or 3 twists..and none of them land, it tries to set up another universe of superheros we know nothing about. It sets up eternium...3 times, but never does anything with it.So i could go on and on and on. But one more thing really irks me is the lack of a sense of dread. Why do we care if the demon guy sits on the throne? Because he unleashed a demon baby army? These ""demons"" remind me of the evil dead they are so lame. They are so weak that normal people and children can stop them with tools and sticks...if a child with a stick can stop the demon army, how are they a threat?","5/10"
"Black Adam","ashley-crookes","3 December 2022","Here is another run of the mill superhero movie. I really was expecting more, but, was sorely disappointed. I felt my eyes closing a few times during this film, so that is never a good sign as I never fall asleep during movies, especially not ones that are supposed to be action orientated!The problem with all the superhero movies these days, is that the writers and directors are making them all - the same. All the heroes seem to have the same un godly powers, super strength, can fly, bullets bounce off them. It's boring. It's tiring. Clearly Superman has rubbed off on every other wannabe hero. And all the B-grade heroes they chuck in on the sidelines just make it worse - Hawkman/hawk guy, the girl who is a tornado or a cyclone or whatever and the dude who grows, I thought I was watching Marvel's Ant-Man again. It feels, meh. I can't even remember the names of their characters and I don't care about them either.Come on DC - you don't have to try copy Marvel. The reason Nolan's Batman films (and even the most recent Batman) were so good, is that there was a story that was properly built and executed and I loved them. The action scenes were then really appreciated. It wasn't just exploding buildings every 3 seconds.","2/10"

The action sequence are not imaginative and Dwyane Johnson just hangs around, literally, instead of being engaging. Too much cgi. Too many roids for Dwayne. Not enough explanation of who and what as far as the Justice Society goes and pathetic attempts at building empathy with the characters with one liners and sudden recognition of the girl in the room.Endless monologues after half of the movie are almost drowned out by the incessant soundtrack. This is not a good movie. Dull as dishwater. Go and sort your laundry out and plan your week instead.","10/10"
"Black Adam","3nines","21 October 2022","The film is incredibly well made. The actors are incredibly good at doing their job.The visual effects in the film are very well done, the CGI is good. The film is very reminiscent of Man Of Steel, the beginning of all DC films.The Rock is and will remain a legend in DC for getting Henry to come back and play superman again after years of fans clamoring and fighting to see Henry again.I liked the last scene where Henry shows up and talks to Black Adam, but I didn't like the theme it chose for the music, had hoped for Hans Zimmer, since Man Of Steel was presented through it.Those true DC fans who loved the Zack movies will really like this movie. Hope we get to see Zack Snyder's version come in active form.It looks promising so far.The movie is highly recommended to DC fans who are interested in seeing now developments that promise more action to come.Thanks, The Rock!","1/10"
"Black Adam","onze-kris","13 December 2022","Today's movies are filled to the brim with moving cameras.Most of the time they are unnecessary and from someone who has loved cinema all his life they come across as complete lack of understanding how to compose a shot.It's like finding the right angle to take a shot. All 2 hours long.The opening sequence, while it would have had some decent shots, if the camera didn't move that much.. is made worse by poor storytelling.I don't blame the person telling the story.The score of the movie has excellent songs.Hal Hartley, David Lynch , and movie student Tarantino are aware of the power of the right song at the right time.Here they are not the right song. But just music at random times really that sort of takeover how long the scene lasts...
Not the movie, not the story, just something random determines the length of a scene.The folks at Roger egbert. Once a respectable reviewsite of movies has watered down to influences wannabees.Often they rate movies according to box office.This makes sense from an influencer standpoint. They give what the masses want.I however I want to read about an Indonesian thriller that now got a small release. If it's bad than it's bad if it's good I want to hear about it.Or other obscure stuff that makes you excited to see.Not about why the box office movies are great.The same can be said about series.Series like squid game are all over the place. Giving it praise sometimes in places were it doesn't deserve praise.A series like sky castle goes mostly unnoticed.ALL OF US ARE DEAD , which actually is quite okay, gets way more attention than Kingdom which is at the top in it's genre.HOWEVER,
there is almost no way in finding that out unless you watch, watch till your eyes bleed.Dwayne Johnson got lauded for his acting at R. E.'s site.Uhm I think he is a good fit for the role. But I don't know if I would call it high level acting.ACTUALLY very little acting is required because of all the action scenes. And him lighting up well it is special effects...if standing or flying in a shot is acting looking at the back at your head, well than clearly I am missing something.I am aware that I have given a lot of 1's lately and honestly it bugs me.So I'll take a break from the box office and try to catch up on independent releases on bluray in 2023.I recently snagged up some anime series and honestly they are way better at keeping my attention and I am more often delighted watching them than frustrated.Because honestly I am frustrated that this movie was made .","1/10"
"Black Adam","cinistersynthicate","21 October 2022","Without question this may very well be the second worst DC film for me, next to 2017 Justice League. For a project that has been over a decade in the making The Rock surely could've campaigned for a better director. Black Adam is one of the most bland comic book movies in years. For a movie that the rock swears is not trying to copy marvel the film does a whole lot of exactly that. The JSA's film debut is sadly not reliant on its wide spanning, fantastic source material and instead is treated like a discount X-men all lead by the one-toned Dwayne Johnson. For someone who was never a fan of the rock to begin with, I tried hard to clear my mind and be unbiased but the rock continues to only play the rock but in a cool costume, there is no feeling of a character being played on screen. The film continues to have this filter to it that does not fit and tries incredibly hard to be hardcore and 'Cool' but comes off by being as cool as flipping your jacket collar up while wearing sunglasses inside. Brosnan's Doctor Fate was without question the thing I looked forward to most when I went into this and this script did him absolutely no good, with dialogue and banter coming off at a CW level of cheap. In conclusion, this movie was made purely by Dwayne Johnson for Dwayne Johnson, it was made cheaply by a throwaway director who would toot the Rocks horn, and the studio just threw it out there to hope audiences would buy into this nonsense, Which clearly it wasn't working which is why in the final press cycle they had to reveal the post credit scene to attract people. Wait for streaming or something.","5/10"
"Black Adam","mj-77488","20 December 2022","The fight scenes were great. Wish the parts in between had the same level of care.Some of the casting choices were bewildering, but not all of the supporting cast were hams. Some turned in great performances.The Rock was not bad, the lines they gave him weren't always the best. Would like to see him reprise the role.Aldis Hodge, and Pierce Brosnan were phenomenal. Especially Hodge. They turned in heartfelt moments, and conveyed true friendship. Could watch a prequel of just them meeting and going on their first missions.Quintessa Swindell, Noah Centineo were also solid additions to the Justice society, albeit not as impactful as Hodge.Bodhi Sabongui seemed very out of place and a lot of what they had his character do and say was baffling. For example, there's a moment where he is addressing a large crowd during a chaotic point of the movie, he seems like he's whispering, and had no intensity in his body which wouldn't fit the scenario at all.I truly wanted to like this film, but there are several moments I just groaned in disappointment, paused the movie just to walk away for an hour or a day. It was tough to chew.","4/10"
"Black Adam","PartTimeCritic","26 February 2023","BLACK ADAM (C) is a bit of a dizzying viewing as it begins with a prologue explaining a brand new pre-history for the DC cinematic universe - one that is complicated with all the stuff introduced from the Snyder cut of Justice League. Black Adam, played by Dwayne Johnson, is introduced as a superhero (connected with the film Shazam in ways I don't remember from that one) that essentially is Superman, except he chooses to use his powers for revenge and he is imprisoned by a powerful wizard council. Anyways, in modern DCU the modern city of Khandaq, built on that ancient city, is being oppressed and they are able to bring back Black Adam to liberate them. It gets complicated as there is a demon crown involved, an intergang authority, and Amanda Waller calls on a Justice Society (kind of like a Justice League or Suicide but good) to go and capture Black Adam. Essentially, the arc for Black Adam is that power isn't to be used for revenge, but for the good of others. It's the same message we got from the very first superhero breakthrough in Sam Raimi's Spiderman - with great powers come great responsibility. I felt serious superhero fatigue in this one with the amount of new lore, powers, and characters they throw at you. I'm sure the background in the comics is complicated, but the way it has played out in the movie makes Dr. Fate feel like a knock off Dr. Strange, Atom Smasher a knock off Ant-Man, and Hawk Man a knock off Falcon. Black Adam for most of the film is just Dwayne looking stern and serious, there's just not much charisma there to be honest. Despite tons of expensive CGI and handsome production values, everything here feels tired, extraneous, and obligatory. If the film had come out on the front end of the superhero trend I think it would be received better. By the time the big showdown with the Armageddon bad guy happens and an apocalyptic demon army arises, I just wanted it to be over.","1/10"
"Black Adam","genham","26 November 2022","Why does the rock insist on making these poor films. If they gave this story more thought and tried to create a realistic version of a comic book with good character development, great origin story that makes sense and characters not doing stupid things. It's a film made for children. I'm a big fan of comic books but when translated into a film they need to consider adults and what we might find intriguing and intelligent. This is just nonsense. He has the potential to do great acting. Ballers was brilliant. He needs to generate adult intelligent films if he wants to step up his film career. Maybe stick to good series rather than films. You don't care about anyone in this film. Acting is average. Story poor. Nothing creative. Poor origin story. Nothing very deep. A film I've seen a hundred times before designed for 7 year olds.","8/10"
"Black Adam","Rasalgheti_2000","21 October 2022","This could have been another generic superhero movie, or The Rock movie for that matter, full of over-the-top special effects, inhumane situations, and finally a boring and tedious movie, but somehow the script, the director and the actors manage to give us an entertaining story, to some extent fresh and above all with an important background message: what is justice? What is revenge? What is the difference between both? Can a hero become a villain? Can a villain become a hero? What is the motivation behind the actions you do? Really a great movie that puts DC / Warner on the map again with great force. I can only hope that it does well at the box office. All of you who haven't seen it yet, don't listen to the critics on Rotten Tomatoes or other similar sites. Those guys don't know shit!","3/10"
"Black Adam","trwbxcpr","20 October 2022","I went expecting something original and exciting, instead I had 2 hours of vague memories and predictable outcomes. It was a patchwork quilt made from every other superhero movie ever made but resulting in a Green Lantern style failure. From slippery Skateboarding brat antagonising the bad guys trying to look super edgy to cringe attempts at subtle humour Drax style that missed the mark. Cyclone was a waste of a character, her wind was colourful though. Pearce tried & was probably the only thing that came close to worth watching. There was little story, less character development and no genuine nemesis until the last 20 minutes, just a poor attempt at creating animosity and conflicts of conscience between the good guys and the predictably soon to be hero. Not one WOW moment, not one moment of tension. My Choc Top was the most enjoyable part of the movie.","5/10"
"Black Adam","imdb-ikysmoviedatabase","21 October 2022","I only watched the trailer of the movie last week. It didn't look like something to be really excited about but I still thought I'd give it a watch. And I managed to watch it on the first show in the local cinema in uk.The opening looked really good with great looking visuals. Action scenes were okay. It keeps switching between fast and slow-motion matrix style action. It partly made me think I'm watching a computer game on the big screen. Black adam has alot of flash lighting, as shown in the trailer, which was a bit annoying, but that's what the films all about with tech adam having God's powers.The story is average nothing special.Five thousand years ago, the city of Kahndaq was under the tyrannical rule of king Anh-Kot, who intended to create the Crown of Sabbac, which is known to give the wearer great power. After enslaving his people and forcing them to dig for ""Eternium"" - the magical crystal needed to create the crown - a young boy leads the slaves to revolt against him. When the boy is given the power of Shazam, transforming him into Kahndaq's heroic champion Teth-Adam, he kills Anh-Kot and ends his reign. So that's the opening before black adam wakes up in the present time, and the action really takes off.The movie keeps slowing down and in the end I felt as if it's really dragging. Over all it is an average movie. I'd say it's only a one time watch.Dwayne Johnson did fine playing black adam cause no acting skills were required for the role. He looked in great shape as always, but no wwe the rock gimmick is used here from him.Therer were only about 5 people watching the film in the first showing of the day. And all weekend occupancy of pre-booking is really bad for a big budget dc movie. Runtime is 2h 4 minutes so not to long without the ads.","7/10"

The film was really good.Action-packed throughout, so I never had a chance to get bored. The CGI was pretty good, and even the humour injected into scenes were as intended - funny (but thankfully without being corny).Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam was believable and executed perfectly. I didn't know anything about the character Black Adam prior to watching, but I really liked him! Probably because he has qualities like me: No nonsense, straight talking and just wants to get on with it and get the job done. Even so, I would've liked to see just a tad more personality which was lacking.Although the story could've taken more risk and lacked some depth it was entertaining and fast-paced.Overall a decent superhero film.","2/10"
"Black Adam","acinemafan","27 December 2022","Dwayne Johnson has a lot of charisma, as exemplified in movies like ""The Jungle Cruise,"" and the ""Jumanji"" movies (he has a great sense of humor). His weakness appears to be dramatic acting (no a scowl is not considered acting).Now, Johnson's shortcomings may have been due to the director not directing him, because the rest of the film is bad, as well. It looks like it looks like it was made for the WB network, where you find those superhero shows in which everything is beautiful - including the cast.A man whose been resurrected after a thousand years, appears to be adjusting quite well. Wow. The quote between Hawkman and Tech-Adam that is shared by this very site is cringe worthy.","3/10"
"Black Adam","BestBenedikt","20 November 2022","How can a 200 million dollar movie look this ugly? Every shot looks fake, every action sequence like straight out of Tarsem Singh's IMMORTALS, just with less style to it.Besides some weird exposition, there is almost no story to be found here - just lazy MacGuffin chasing as a framework for the most untasteful CGI extravaganza that makes you feel like experiencing a migraine aura. And if BLACK ADAM's dialogue doesn't manage to kill of your brain cells, I don't know what will.The context this movie chooses to localise itself in is also odd to say the least: a fictional country named Kahndaq, basically an americanized version of Iraq, occupied by ""international mercenaries"" - with a kid on his skateboard telling one of the evil occupiers that they are ""stealing our resources, suppressing our heritage"" within the first few minutes. That's strangely ideological and vague for the sake of being applicable to global audiences at the same time.I guess Pierce Brosnan is the only bright spot in this seizure-inducing schlock. And I still don't get why they won't just say ""Shazam!"" all the time.","3/10"
"Black Adam","arficus","25 November 2022","This was hard to watch. I might expect action sequences to strain the bounds of credulity in such a film, but the dialogue? Wooden, nonsensical at times. Not any kind of nonsensical that adds anything, but just inane - writing so poor that it can't track the logical coherence between character, setting, and voice. It helped to remind myself that this was part of a comic book franchise.I'll sometimes watch such flicks just for the visual entertainment, eg The CGI. This film let me down in that department as well. Lots of high speed action that looked very cartoon like and flat. The morphing figures frequently reminded me of action sequences from popular cartoons of the 1930s such as Pluto and Mickey Mouse.If you're not already a fan of DC comic universe films (or whatever they're called) then definitely avoid. If you are a fan, please disregard what I've written and rock on.","1/10"

The music score felt cold and repetitive and had this non-stop false sense of foreboding. I understand what they were trying to do with the story but those intended 'emotional moments' just miss due to the lack of character development, something that can only be achieved through multi year/multi project films.I honestly don't know where the almost $200 million budget went, but I can tell you Warner Bros./DC need to step their CGI/Green Screen game up to ILM level.

We have seen these kinds of movies over and over. Now we expect more. Give us better character development, give us complex multifaceted characters.

"Black Adam","lord_orsum","23 October 2022","First and foremost, I am a Marvel fan, but Black Adam is by far a better film than either Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness or Thor: Love and Thunder (the latter being the MCUs worst film to date).After more than a decade of wonderful MCU films, they have recently lost their way, with too much comedy and not enough drama or peril. Conversely, DC has spent a decade struggling to find the right balance of light and dark (tending too much to the latter), and their recent films have started to get that right (with the exception of the truly awful Wonder Woman 1984).Black Adam benefits from Dwayne Johnson's not inconsiderable charisma, and Pierce Brosnan brings some quality acting to a cast that seriously needs it.The plot is fairly standard and predictable, occasionally let down by some truly stupid decisions by the ""heroes"" (for example, when meeting a 5000-year-old super-being, who got his powers freeing his oppressed people, why would the first thing you say to them is to demand that they surrender and bend their knee to you?!?!?)The story occasionally touches on important questions, especially the one about a country that has been oppressed for years, yet no superhero has showed up until Black Adam appears. I would like to have seen this blatant hypocrisy more explored by the heroes, questioning what good they are actually doing in the world, and who they are actually helping.Well done DC; it took you long enough, but you got there in the end!","1/10"

Because it has ""The Rock"" in it, I allowed my expectations to rise.Sadly, this was an overlong, terribly written snoozefest. All the fight scenes are overly dramatic, with too many slow motion interjections and way overdone CGI. The story lacks any reason to care about the characters or coherency. The dialogue and character interaction is simply terrible (even the actors seem incredibly bored with it).When a character dies, and you don't feel any empathy or care it is a reflection of terrible writing. This movie has plenty of that.All in all, a waste of time and money.","6/10"
"Black Adam","stuwright05","18 December 2022","I did look forward to this, but the trailer was better than the film, the story just wasnt very good, and theres just too much cgi when all the justice society are fighting, its like watching a scene from a ps5 game, there was no real character development so i wasnt really bothered with what happened to who.Its just an ok film, I love the rocks films, faster is in my top 10, now thats a great film. The worst character was definatly hawkman.I think the people saying this is great are either getting paid or are teens who like any superhero nonsense. The superhero genre seems to be going downhill since that last avengers film, which was great,but i think that hit the peak of things, and now its all been downhill. Maybe the new animated spiderman will be good, I hope so.","3/10"

If God gave me another chance, I would have given these tickets to the people I hate the most as a gift. Because I know they will suffer from watching the worst acting in humankind history.The movie feels like it's Avengers but bought on WISH, and it feels so cheap that my grandma in China even knows its a knockoff version.I want to use this movie in my future film classes to show how not to make a movie. This is the perfect example of how to treat your audience like kindergarten toddlers.","3/10"
"Black Adam","whitestar_man","14 October 2023","Looks very pretty and lots of action, and that's about it on the positive front for me.Part cheap take on Wakanda, if Wakanda was Arab and taken over by bland cliche private military company.Part cheap wannabe knock off of Tomb Raider, Part cheap knock off of pretty much every comic book movie with what I assume are meant to be funny scenes that are flatter than a crepe.I didn't expect much, but even then it disappointed. It lacked soul and purpose other than to further bury DC movies.Even the action scenes are a let down. Yeah lots of CGI and explosions but there is no gravity to them, you don't care who dies or why. Some are gruesome but even then just in a very clinical manner.There was no one character I cared about, good or bad. After 40 minutes I was done.In the end all that can be said is there is not just no reason to watch this, there was no reason for it to be made. Maybe a decade this would have been OK but there is so much of this stuff, that something this bland was bound to fail. It's not even so bad it's funny or worth watching to see a train wreck.It's bland meh with lots of CGI.","6/10"
"Black Adam","jusglenn","21 October 2022","I really wanted to like this movie, but i just couldnt. The whole thing just felt rushed. Imo, the JSA didnt need to be in this movie. The exposition dump at the beginning, shouldve been the first hour of the movie. Bc its so rushed, there is zero emotional impact. Dr. Fate deserves more. He is a powerhouse in the DC pantheon, and to be just thrown in like a sidekick really didnt sit right with me. The only one that shouldve been in the movie was hawkman. Since he is an archeologists in the comics, it couldve meshed really well if he found him and tried to guide to be a hero. Another missed opportunity. However, hawkman and dr.fate saved the movie. The fight scenes and cinematography were great tho. And why have child actors been so horrid lately? The little boy was terrible. Ik they couldve found someone better. I enjoyed it but it just felt hollow. The soundtrack was pretty awesome tho. Kids will love this movie tho, but if youre an honest movie critic, youll tear it apart.","1/10"

Its humor is dry and ground-level. The characters have no charisma whatsoever. I walked out of it after 30 minutes. It's all just references as well, going ad far as to compare a stand-off with ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" to a meaningless scene theta takes place literally 5 minutes later. The visual effects are pretty awful too. I'll say it again; this movie is loud, headache-inducing loud. I will keep doing what I was doing before and just stick to Batman films when it comes to superheroes. Save your money. Skip this trash.","1/10"

In 15 minutes into the movie we could easily see that this a low level action film with cheesy jokes(wanna be deadpool style jokes) and feels like a computer game after a while. There is a reason it says 12A as it is targeting 12-14 year old kids maybe they could call it Spy Kids featuring Black Adam the confused hero who is not sure what he wants and who he is.That was waste of our 1 hour 20 minutes as we walked we could not deal with it anymore and waste of our £18 which we could use it for new halloween movie i am sure it cant be worse than this.","1/10"

I am sorry but I am bored with the superhero movie type. In the beginning it was OK. But in the last ten years the invasion of superhero movies become unbearable. Let's face it, all the super heroes are the same. The same pathetic fights with heroes flying through the air ( boooring) crushing in the buildings and fighting with bad guys who are slightly less powerful . The story makes no sense. He is a god , se is the devil, I am the father of the hero blah, blah, blah. To be ""original"" they come with an Egyptian god but they use an Samoan actor. Also Teth? Kinda Jewish. When I was a kid I use to read comics with superheroes. I was ten and i like to make fun of them because on a paper magazine you can draw or change the words.","9/10"
"Black Adam","i_shubhamrai","26 October 2022","Black Adam serves the fans what they wanted with utmost sincerity. Great VFX-CGI, a nice storyline, amazing action sequence. It is perfectly balanced with the Shazam world and is a perfect homage to Zack Snyder's way of DCEU. The kid IN THE MOVIE will win your heart. Be prepared to get goosebumps. Dr. Fate is a character everyone would fall for. Cyclone and Atom Smasher did justice to the portrayal. Dwayne at his best caliber carried the entire movie on his shoulders. The BGM is awesome. This is an outstandingly entertaining film. Keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. Critics definitely went too far in criticism.","4/10"
"Black Adam","TheAffableFool","2 January 2023","Super powered anti hero awakens after 5000 years of slumber, speaks fluent English, walks through walls for no reason where he could use doors, speaks in very questionable lines and within 30 minutes becomes entangled in a heroic plan to save a random boy he met briefly. Where action scenes are pretty good, full of explosions and superpowers the rest of this film is a total mess. The plot develops very quickly without allowing the main character to catch up so the whole thing is rushed and very cheesy. This could have easily been done so much better and smoother. I guess they wanted the anti hero to become a hero very quickly so they rushed through the plot and re-wrote his true nature as they pleased. It's a mess. Watch it for a silly movie night but considering I rewatched Zach Snyder's 4 hour justice league cut last night I can assure you this is a badly written action packed mess.","2/10"
"Black Adam","pedrotremacoldirossi","26 November 2022","A complete insult. Way worse than movies like Morbius and Justice League. Bad comments here are spot on and there is no way that good commenta are legitimate. There is nothing good about this movie - the individual with wings is the most annoying character in a DC/Marvel movie by a long shot. Also he has no powers and gets beaten by Black Adam multiple times without any injuries? How's that possible?The acting is so poor all around - particularly from the Atom kid, above said guy with wings, and pretty much everybody else.Do not watch this, no matter what. I defied the negative reviews because only wanted a fun and entertaining movie and now I deeply regret my decision.","3/10"
"Black Adam","veritybingo","18 November 2022","The story had the potential of a grand epic, but... once again we are given yet another tie-in to an existing franchise where everyone is blasé about gods & superheroes, like so what, we've seen it all before. This is not storytelling. It seems this 'film' was engineered by and intended for gamers.The effects pretty much inspire no awe, the script is bland and unoriginal, the acting is unbelievably dull.. Though Dwayne does look the part and has successfully avoided bringing his comedy brain to work as he should.The only entertaining character is Kamir (Mo Amer) who seems to have been written by somebody else and has the only identifiable trace of personality in the film whatsoever.","5/10"
"Black Adam","rjgrund-123-603438","17 December 2022","After all the hype and promotion I was expecting so much more than this mess. If this was the Rock's passion project I would hate to see what it would have been if it wasn't. The script was weak and the characters one dimensional. The secondary characters were cartoonish. Whoever wrote this had no clue how to write a superhero film. All they had to do was watch some Marvel movies. The casting left a lot to be desired. Outside of Dwayne Johnson it looked like everyone was phoning their performances in. The editing and effects were not on par with the type of film this desired to be. And the director had no clue what he was doing most of the time. Another bad choice in my opinion.From the beginning it was off to a bad start with the voice over background story that could have been told later, and was, in brief shots. The first ten minutes were unnecessary. Cut another 20 minutes and this film would have flowed better. And then there is the Henry Cahill Superman cameo at the end to remind us of that mess. And to think that's the last time we will see Cavill's Superman. I can see why this film didn't make money. No one wanted to see it twice. Even for free I know I don't.","2/10"
"Black Adam","jarkko-15938","16 December 2022","I have enjoyed a lot of this genre movie in the past. But to be honest..this movie has nothing to say, all it is is special effects by a computer..and not so great ones. I think that the producers knew this and for all that in mind they decided that they should use Dwayne Johnson as a Lead caracter..boy were they wrong. D can only carry for so far..And another think I'd like to put out is the special effects..those are not you would see in a movie like, for example, in Avatar..it is like a ten year ole made teen. I wanted to like it..but this one I had to skip more than one scene🙄 But hey..you have to see it to believe it!","4/10"
"Black Adam","trumpisafatpileofshit","29 December 2022","Black Adam... more like Whack Shat-am! So yes, there is a lot of action, and super powers, and advanced tech, an ancient tech, but it doesn't make up for the poor story writing. There's a lot of over used tropes and unnecessary moments who's sole purpose is to force the story along, and this is because they didn't do a good enough job writing (or maybe were too lazy). There are the scenes that seem cringy and redundant, but without them they would have no way to tie this jumble of action sequences together. A better writer (or even a mediocre novice writer) would connect these moments with ""therefore"" or ""but"", but this whole movie seems connected by ""and then"". They wrote the big budget prerequisite Hollywood action sequences and filled the story in after.Now, let's talk about how many times they chose to rip off Marvel. Was it to try and draw marvel fans in with familiarity? Was it to trick you into thinking it was good by the tying your memories to better movies? Was it because they're trying to hop on a stylized bandwagon? Yes to all. I won't expose all the rips, because I didn't care enough to count. The most obvious ones are:Their jet coming out of the underground hanger at a mansion and the jet's shape is completely ripped from The X-Men.The atom rearranger guy is a rip off of AntMan. And while I don't know who came first in the comic world, I can tell you that Ant Man has always been more famous, and the fact the he's been in at least 5 Marvel movies means DC should have picked a character with different, more unique powers for this.This atom rearranger guy's mask is completely ripped off of the design of Deadpool's. The same tight leather with flat white eyes. There's a million ways to construct a mask that is based on a drawing, and countless materials. They specifically chose these to piggyback on the love for and success of Deadpool.The chose a character who reminds us of Storm, and a character that is similar to falcon. During the first introductions, they surround this Hawkman character with super advanced technology and dress him if traditional African patters and colors. This is to tie him to the success of Black Panther, an so you remember how much you loved that movie while watching this steamer.Not a marvel reference but they make the van look like the Mystery Machine from Scooby Doo.There are many more but I'm already bored. I do think Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has jumped the shark on this one. His acting and characters are always the same, his movies are all slices of cheese, but they've always been a good time. I did not enjoy myself watching this and it made me hyper-focused on the fact that The Rock doesn't actually act. He just says lines and has muscles. If he can act, then so can I, and so can a bucket of paint.DC needs to quit while they're behind... their movies are behind... their movies are butt.","9/10"
"Black Adam","lucaslunt","29 October 2022","Awesome movie!! Great action and doesn't succumb to the ""woke"" movement that have destroyed movies for the past 2 years. Don't listen to the critics, probably one of DC's top films and the audience score really shows it.If you want excellent action, decent story, and nothing to do with Hollywood politics trying to push some dumb point down your throats than watch Black Adam. I beg everyone to rate this movie high so that DC/Marvel/Sony and any other superhero/sci-fi studio realizes that what we want is bad ass action, amazing characters, good story, and to stop ruining our beloved movies by trying to be ""woke"". We're already aware of such subjects from our everyday life and movies are meant to be entertainment.","8/10"
"Black Adam","Beesmiley","22 October 2022","Good- Much better than expected, great amount of action, some parts were pretty funny (like the appropriately timed sarcasm jokes) and the graphics were nice for the most part. DC definitely made a come back with the film. Dwayne Johnson delivered and Viola Davis will always be funny. Really liked the surprise ending, so definitely stick around a bit after credits for that.Bad - Some parts were predictable, like who would really die and as others mentioned the CGI of the city was a bit laughable.Ugly - Why was Black Adam mostly hovering when others were talking to him? That part seemed overemphasised. Some parts with the kid on the skate board could've also be cut out.. unnecessary.Overall it was a good watch, so recommend to see it and it will be good to see if there's a follow up to the ending.","4/10"
"Black Adam","jeanvieve7","17 December 2022","Am I one of the few that think this film is a hot mess?We have gotten to a point in films where visual effects are a given!! Movies in this genre are now cranked out on a conveyer belt rather than being the rare treat that began the trend in 2008. Now they are made by being plumped up with so much visual stimuli, computer generated effects, canned dialogue, and quick back stories (as ploy to delve into present-day action)... we seem to not even notice lack of character development or actual story.Black Adam could be a poster child for the aforementioned formula. There are no bad actors in this film. They simply are not given A good script to work with, or any character to develop or substance to get their teeth into.It's a tough one because I like Dwayne Johnson. I like Pierce Brosnan, I even like and enjoy some of the more minor characters in this film including Sarah Shahi and Aldis Hodge. But they are utterly wasted in this film. I feel like this movie was so quick to get into action that everything else was an afterthought....a quick throwaway backstory, throw in some characters which were completely cliché and steriotyped into villains, antihero's, and oppressed (etc), there was simply no thought into creating any kind of depth or originality.This movie is pure formula. The type of film that you could have plugged in some algorithms and classic clichés from superhero movies into an AI, and have it write a script for you.I'm glad I'm writing this right after watching the movie. Because I'm sure by tomorrow I will have forgotten it.","6/10"
"Black Adam","phantomkrome","20 October 2022","Honestly felt like the whole marketing campaign was super overdone and filled with a lot more lies that what other movies do. It's a very messy movie and struggles to find a purpose and decent end goal, the story is very very weak and Black Adam's character is EXTREMELY plain and one dimensional, no character development. JSA was such a wasted potential especially with a solid cast. Hawkman and Dr Fate out shine Atom Smasher and Cyclone but are but even then these characters are not well written. Hawkman becomes the good character that never agrees with the main character and always wants to fight him (very cliché). Visuals were 7/10 but the direction ruined it for me, the director definitely tired a lot of what Snyder did in MoS and ZSJL but with a dollar store level of execution. Everything in this movie feels forced. Black Adam's emotional backstory, his people's champions thing and even the final credits scene, all feels like it was squeezed in. Felt like they had like 2-3 major ideas and everything else was forced in. In terms of the general action, it's actually not bad, again very much inspired by what Snyder does with poor execution. The intro fight was actually very good and the Black Adam escapes scene was great as well but the rest of the movie had pretty terrible action, especially the 3rd act, except for the Dr Fates fight scenes in the 3rd act, I thought it was pretty good, but definitely could have improved on it significantly with a few tweaks, this again goes back to weak screenplay and direction. Also I hate the weird Hollywood Mexico colour grading/filter, everything was all yellowish and I hate when Hollywood movies do that, usually DC refrained from this but this was a terrible choice.Overall it isn't a terrible movie and probably is good enough to be a 7/10 but I think for most people it's gonna be a 5/10 and honestly the 6/10 is for the TERRIBLE marketing scheme and completely misguiding the audience. I don't believe The Rocks gonna save DC, not until I see better results. I think everything he did was just a massive promotion for the movie. Especially the post credit scene, it was 100% a later addition just to get more audience.","7/10"
"Black Adam","capitanotm","19 October 2022","First i must say Rock is perfect for this role, just like Cavil is for Superman.Story is good, depth is decent, humor is sometimes just so-so, but mostly it has great effect and builds really strong impression of that aspect of the movie.My problem is with the finally fight as black adam was not able to defeat the bad guy alone, or he didnt even have any time to do it, since it ended pretty fast, but with the help of the flying guy. So i am the of those who really hate when main badass needs help, as movies before and during me growing up were so that badass guy always wins and that is how it is supposed to be, not always needing teams, especially in kinda standalone movies like this.Effects 10/10, humor mostly 9/10, story 7/10, finally fight 4.5/10.But firmly looking forward for movie with black adam and superman hoping to see that amazing fight on big screens, to see if movie makers will be as books were black adam is the most powerful of all!","2/10"

"Black Adam","MattTB87","19 November 2022","Since DC currently have all their mainline characters on lockdown while they figure out what to do with ""The Flash"", Black Adam fills a void that really should be another Superman or Batman movie.It's not Zak Snyder's Justice League, but the overall tone is similar. Think Samaritan or the first Captain America movie rather than an epic superhero romp.Side characters come and go with no consequence, the audience stand in androgynous teen becomes a driving plot point for no reason I could work out and the attempts to humanise Adam and turn him from ""all powerful destroyer"" into ""oh okay we're basically superman now"" are a little jarring but hey, some JLA characters turn up, new Hawkman is cool and Dr Fate portrayed by Pierce Brosnan is excellent so it's not all bad.Solid 6/10 superhero action, not as good as Watchmen, The Batman or the majority of Marvel films, but perfectly watchable.","3/10"

It strikes on the level of a very hollow and very shallow video game. There is no character depth and there is no supporting characters worth anything. You could say Dr Fate is the exception and I won't argue with that.. Pierce Brosnan did the best he could and that turned out to be better than this movie deserved. Everything else is a shallow idiotic CGI-fest. They absolutely miscast Hawkman by the way.

So thats cool.

They could do more research about humor. And test it on a bigger group of people.* There were too many fight scenes and special effects. I had the feeling I was at a carnival, watching a light show.

"Black Adam","olafpiers","18 December 2022","As per ""tradition"", every DC movie of the past year introduces way too many characters with way too little backstory set against a predictable storyline that features a guy/girl in a cape who is too strong for their own good. Black Adam is no different.Besides Black Adam, we are introduced to 4 new heroes and their ""boss"", but after 2 hours I still have no idea who's who and what their relationship is. Some characters seem to be there for emotional context or comic relief, but as they are not properly introduced, they failed to deliver any emotional response from me.Although the character Black Adam is refreshing in its brutality, his arc and the storyline of the overall movie are boringly predictiable. Take the plot of any superhero movie (especially DC) and you've got the plot of Black Adam. The main cast do a good job at portraying the characters, but the writers and editors seem simply lazy.","1/10"
"Black Adam","Segz17","23 November 2022","The trailer made this movie look like a serious action hero movie but sadly with awful humor and terrible acting this is nothing more than just an action packed, over the top CGI kids movie.

Yet he didn't even know that was black adams tomb in the beginning? After he got the crown was he than supposed to find black Adam if they didn't release him in the beginning? I don't know, I feel like someone could have easily made up a way better storyline than how it was. Also the fact that the whole movie took place in one day was terrible.The acting was pretty bad but that's the fault of the character choices. The teenage characters from justice league and the kid ruined the movie for me. Again reverts back to this just being a kids movie.So all and all super underwhelming just like the Hercules movie. I'll probably never watch this movie again.","1/10"
"Black Adam","kevlee-64793","22 November 2022","What is that narrative in the beginning? At least you had Pierce Brosnan acting his part might as well let him narrate. It sounded like a 3rd grade was reading from a textbook. And the acting for goodness sake, mediocre at best. No wonder you had to use those actors, its the only way for Dwane Johnson to shine in this movie for his acting skills. Dreadful. At least in my point of view DC had a good going for their first suicide squad movie and then flopped with their 2nd movie. And this Black Adam now? Hell no. There was no character build up, just CGI flashing all over the places. And c'mon, it took 5000 years for someone to find the crown while knowing where it exactly is? There would be government people all over the place for it. Good thing I saved my money not watching is in the cinema, couldn't even stand 1 hour into the movie. Garbage.","5/10"
"Black Adam","mrbwiz422","17 November 2022","Imagine if the Justice League movie was entirely centered around that random Russian family for some reason.That's this movie.The mother/son/uncle are all terrible actors and their dialogue is awful. Either the studio heads forced them in or the writers were unable to connect the story together without them... But it would have been so much better if they were written out, and would have cut at least 30 minutes of dead weight out of this movie.While there are other issues in the film, it would have made everything far more bearable.With them you have this super powerful character, who is admittedly not good, giving up... quite a lot... for an idiot child he just met. And many many many other scenes and actions that make no sense.Why does Fate and everyone keep taking off their helmets/masks in battle? DC still has not learned that it's stupid for this to happen to show off the actor.You also have another DC CGI villain who is just there to be a CGI villain. Already has pretty much complete control before events happen, goals majorly unclear.","5/10"

Why have they been absent from that country while the villains were rampant all those years? Boring villain with no explanation of why and where he got these powers, you're just expected to know or read the plot before watching the movie.Adam could have been a good anti hero for DC. Forget the misplaced morals of this society that only intervenes when they think they can win or are right. No attempt to help the people. Just as much destruction as with Adam saving the day.","9/10"

Just great action that stuck with the story line.However, you know who's the real hero of the movie when the audience claps when they see Superman come to the scene. THAT was awesome!That's all I have to say about this movie so far but I have to have a certain amount of characters in this review to be able to hit the submit button.Let's see... Dwayne Johnson does make a great Black Adam. Go see the movie so you too can see Superman in the post credit scene.It was precook to hear everyone in the theater clapping for Hevry Cavill's return.","8/10"
"Black Adam","egg_egan","30 April 2023","Just watched Black Adam with my son and have to say we really enjoyed it. Dwayne Johnson is outstanding as the anti-hero Black Adam and is supported by some other excellent acting performances especially from Pierce Brosnan. The ex James Bond actor is brilliant as Dr Fate (DC's version of Dr Strange) and even though the hero's used within the film are not your average household names they are used brilliantly in tandem with Johnson's character. There is lots and lots of action which we both loved which is a breathe of fresh air from other hero films recently which seem to forget they are meant to fun and action packed rather than completely story driven.I am slightly disappointed to hear that DC do not plan to make a Black Adam 2 as I think they have a good opportunity to create a great franchise. If they do not plan a sequel I just hope they plan to use Black Adam is other future DC films.","2/10"
"Black Adam","krzysiektom","12 December 2022","Rubbish. It's hard to imagine a superhero, big budget film with Brosnan and the Rock to be so boring... but they have achieved that! Awful script, predictable, clichéd, with a wooden dialogue and a wooden acting by Rock. He acts here as if he were a wooden plank indeed. Too much of special effects, some of them really lousy... Overbearing, constant music... It was really a challenge for me to not leave the screening earlier. Shame on Pierce Brosnan for participating in this, probably the worst and stupidest movie he has ever been in. And lastly: the Imdb requirement of at least 600 characters is IDIOTIC.","8/10"
"Black Adam","joshuanichols-64320","11 November 2022","What I actually ended up watching was nothing short of completely unwatchable garbage.First of all, the editing. OH MY GOD, THE EDITING. Every single scene in this film, not just the action sequences, made me feel like I was having a stroke and made it almost impossible for me to even try and invest in anything going on. I'm not joking when I say that most, if not all of the talking scenes follow the same trend of there being a deep focus on the characters face, the character saying 1-2 sentences, the camera immediately cutting to the next character who says 1-2 sentences or even simply making 1 facial expression, and then immediately cutting to the next person. As someone who usually isn't nitpicky about film editing all that much, even I have to point out how nauseous and distracting it is that there is an average of 10 cuts per 15 seconds throughout the entire experience. The fact that 95% of the editing actually got approved past post production and made it into the final product is utterly beyond me. I genuinely wonder how people could even have fun with this film when, even by simple human comprehension standards, everyone should have been suffering just trying to look at this film.But even if you could possibly ignore this one fatal flaw that would make the entire experience near unwatchable enough on its own, the movie is still terrible. The core conflict behind this film is supposed to be exploring the idea of whether Black Adam is actually a hero or not since he constantly kills any one who stands in his way or oppresses his people, with this JSA team being the pure opposing force to his actions. On paper, that seems like a very intriguing premise, right? Well, in execution, the movie fails to bring any of the nuance that would make this idea even remotely work or have stakes. The villains of the film are nothing but ruthless, 1 note cartoon villains who opress Black Adams homeland for.....reasons, and who we aren't asked to sympathize with at all, so why should we be doing anything but rooting for Black Adam to kill them? I'm sorry, but these people are just not worth living if they won't stop at anything to oppress and/or kill innocent people that are actually worthy of life. So this movie's attempts at trying to make Black Adam not seem wholly heroic, especially with him outright saying it dozens of times, just comes off as extremely edgy, and the ideology driving the JSA's actions becomes really forced and empty.Half of the actors in this film don't even seem interested in giving decent performances. With the boy in particular who was nothing but a supportive mouthpiece for Black Adam and the plot not being able to change his single facial expression to save his life, even when people he cares about are actively getting threatened.I also like how the exposition in the film just never ends. You never feel the weight of anything when people are constantly explaining the plot and their respective backstories to the audience, rather than the filmmakers deciding to opt to show them. Literally the only things keeping me from giving this movie a 1/10 is Pierce Brosnans performance and chemistry with the rest of the characters, a surprisingly good and unique score, and decent visual effects.I do not know how anyone could have possibly enjoyed this film. Again, it's not even fun bad. It's just complete garbage that represents all of the worst traits of studio franchise filmmaking. Please, do not waste the price of a movie ticket and 2 hours of your time on this. If you want to watch a really fun and off the walls action movie with with a wide, varied, and great cast, and distinct characters to compliment said cast, then Bullet Train is far more worth the price of admission. Or if you simply want great artistic fairs to see at the theatres, then you'll love Banshees of Inisherin, Tar, and the Fablemans. Just please. You can do better than this.","3/10"
"Black Adam","nogodnomasters","7 November 2022","The production begins with the backstory of Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) in 2600 BCE. In some Middle Eastern location known as Kahndaq before the pyramids and Babylon which isn't exactly correct. A slave finds the rare mineral eternium (DC likes pretend elements) which through a series of circumstances creates a hero who says Shazzam to fight the villain demon who says Sabbac. (I'm not making this up.) It then switches to modern day Kahndag which is still occupied by the Intergang who exploit the nation's natural resources, yadda, yadda, yadda. The Intergang is futuristic with their two way wrist band screens, but still use walkie -talkies. Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) is a wanted rebel and our protagonist. She wants to locate the eternium crown worn by Ahk-ton who says Sabbac and never ""Ni"". She wants to prevent the Intergang of finding it first, so she wants to find it and rehide it. If you have ever seen this done in any movie the script writer only knows how to have the bad guys follow the good guys who lead them right to it. Faced with certain death and the bad guys getting the crown she says a bunch of words and a bullet proof Dwayne Johnson (redundent?) appears and takes them out. With nearly 90 minutes of film left, it doesn't end so soon. A bunch of guys from the Justice League show up, the ones we haven't seen yet, and they go after our bald hero because he works like a bull in a China shop and kills bad guys rather than take them all prisoner and torture them with a comfy chair. We end up in a three way battle as more plot fills in.The film has all kind of posters for the DC heroes we know like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman and even some dropped DC comic books as more product placement. Pierce Brosnan plays Dr. Fate because Dr. Strange is Marvel and Sean Connery is dead. Some of the CG effects left something to be desired, especially early in the film I was thinking did Asylum make this? My biggest disappointment was the limited usage of the Dwayne Johnson humor. It was very dry humor, by design. They could have saved a lot of money and had Eric Fields play the part and say it was Dwayne Johnson. Hmm. Maybe they did that.Guild: I did hear a quick F word spoken by Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) when he messed up and had to turn around.","1/10"
"Black Adam","muziqaz","26 November 2022","What is this drivel? Does anyone at DC actually know how to develop a character? Or stitch up filmed/CGI clips into sequential movie?Who is hawkman? What is Justice Society? Who is that colourful whirlpool chick? What's up with the discount Antman. Is Pierce Brosnan portraying discount Dr. Strange? WTF are they doing in Kahndaq? The Lara Croft lady said it correctly: Who are you, why are you suddenly here and not when country needed them to be freed from occupation. Why does it feel like every scene in the movie is like a separate clip without any sense of continuation? And did writers have a meeting after everything was written and read through the script and decided this scene needs a lame joke, or that scene needs something comedic, because that's how it felt: forced humor. Conversations between whirlpool chick and discount Antman: is this how kids talk to each other these days?Movie felt like Hobbs vs Shaw in DCU.What's up with the credit scene? Why are movie creators trying to push sequel through this forceful out of place animosity between heroes? I mean Black Adam just went through 2 hours of character development to become reasonable and somewhat see good and have purpose. At the end of the movie he said country needs protector, which is a codename for ""he is keeping it to himself and protecting/rebuilding the country"". Yet credit scene shows that dumb**s invite the challenge for more destruction. Like, dude, you have plenty to do in Kahndaq, give it a rest. But yeah, nah, forceful dialogue with Superman will sort it out.And CGI...The slow motion... It's year 2022, not 1999.I'd have gladly watched origin stories for Hawkman, discount Antman, whirlpool chick and discount Dr Strange and finally justice society before Black Adam, but guess DCU start their story telling from the middle.","4/10"
"Black Adam","timgv-d-berg1997","27 November 2022","In fact the movie is about 4 lame rip-off super heroes and a reworked kind of chaotic good version of superman. The story is predictable and forgettable, the dialog is lame and the characters are mostly idiots and there is just no reason to care about them at all. I don't know any of these super heroes yet they are portrait as if we should know them by heart. And really we already do know all of them since they are just a rip-off from other superheroes. Mainly Dr strange, falcon, deadpool, and then a weird combo of superman and storm. You could honestly play this at 10x speed and still understand everything that happened. In the first 5 min they do a quick overview of black adams history filmed in a zack snyder style and I can say with full confidence that that's the best part of the movie, and you could easily make that a 2 hour film and have it be way better than this. Assuming it was directed by zack snyder. I guess the one upside is the minimal inclusion of a leftist political agenda.","1/10"
"Black Adam","lorna-adair-133-801166","24 October 2022","For crying out load DC you had a blockbuster on your hands and the standard of CGI villain was laughable.The costume worn by Black Adam was average ( Green Lantern had a better one). Distracting cod piece and they made his rear end flat.What was the point in Atom Smasher and Cyclone they were just there to make the numbers up, Hawkman must admit I clapped when he got stabbed. The MVP of this whole film was Dr Fate, played amazingly by Pierce Brosnan, although not on screen for long I would easily watch a film on his character alone.Thank goodness for the mid credit scene is the only way this deserves a sequel.","3/10"
"Black Adam","Kritikalodia","21 November 2022","The movie was announced so long ago that much of the excitement was lost by the time it came out, especially because of the disastrous experiments post Nolan's tryst with DC. Black Adam keeps it straight and simple without attempting too many subplots but that doesnt help because most of the characters are really inconsequential including the Justice Society. The actor's give their best but they are made to walk oft trodden plotlines. So, nothing really to watch out for except Brosnan's charm and Dwayne's smoldering Rock postures. Dwayne could have done better than his usual stares but beyond histronics he was never really a great actor. And what a joke of a villain they have made of such terrible VFX. Is the 'superhero cinema' dead?","3/10"
"Black Adam","Robosharp","7 January 2023","I got fifty minutes in and couldn't watch anymore. It was simply a waste of time. This was a generic CGI fest that moved at cartoon pace.There have been so many of these type films in recent times, I've lost count. You would think that cinemagoers would call time on it but apparently not. The youth of today seem to lap this kinda crap up and therefore the movie companies will keep churning them out.Please Hollywood, please, take a chance on something different. Something original, something with a story. A story that we get lost in, gripped by. Something that leaves you stuck in your seat at the end, too captivated to move. Remember those films? Feels like a long long time ago.Black Adam is none of the above and quite frankly the contrary. Thought it might at least be funny having the Rock in it - it isn't.","9/10"
"Black Adam","jdowney-57-371157","15 January 2023","This movie is pretty much the perfect example of why DC hired James Gunn. It's clear that director Jaume Collet-Serra was not a DC comic book fan. Nor does it appear that anyone associated with the movie was. And that is what is wrong here.John Favreau, who directed Ironman, as example, was a fan boy as a kid. All the Marvel movies had Stan Lee at least involved. When producers and moneymen hand the movie over to people who are doing a job but don't understand the passion that drives comic book fans about their respective universe, you wind up with this flashy action pack junk kind of movie.It starts with the plot and dialogues. People got a nice paycheck to write the story...and they don't have any investment in the characters.One example: a standard character, the precocious all too smart kid who cracks wise and cozies up to the hero... the first scheme we meet him in is sneaking past an 'Intergang' checkpoint.. his dialogue to the thug who stops him - ""What you are is a neo-imperialist enforcer from halfway around the world sent here to steal my country's natural resources, strip-mine our sacred mines, pollute our water, oppress our heritage, and make us wait in line all day"". That is actual dialogue. The kid continues in this vein throughout the film.So of course, before its all over...little buddy gets kidnapped by the baddies and our hero has someone to save.Prety lame.In the same way, the lady who ran the Suicide Squad shows up to introduce us to a basically random bunch of people called 'The Justice Society'. We don't know who they are. We don't really care. But they come to attempt to shut down Black Adam, and then make an alliance of sorts with him.Now the problem here is the Justice Society is an old DC Supergroup. Two of these characters, Hawkman and The Atom (who is called Atom Smasher in this movie) were two solid characters from the DC Comics of the Silver Age. Here they are just random unexplained heroes, and since Antman stole Atom's thunder, they go with 'Atom Smasher' who only gets bigger not smaller. And who the hell is Hawkman here? No idea. Why is Dr. Fate his 'old friend'? We don't know. Quintessa Swindell plays Cyclone. She is cute, vivacious and had a great presence...but her lines were lame, her purpose in the film was unimportant, and again...who she was or what she was doing there is just not explained. Mainly she and Atom Smasher are young and get to talk to each other while the adults are busy.And of course: The Rock. The thing about Dwayne Johnson that makes him popular is his self-deprecating sly humor. This character is so humorless that it strips Johnson from a chance to really connect with the audience and get buy in.As other reviews have noted...the CGI and fight scenes provide some spectacle. But that is it...a make believe country, some international gang with flying motorcycles for no reason, a bunch of heroes we don't know, the rock looking pumped up and dour, and an annoying kid and mom combo to play the middle eastern version of Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen to Black Adam.James Gunn...go back and read the Silver Age comic books. DC had not only the Big Duo of Supe and Batman...they had Hawkman, Atom, Green Arrow, Flash, The Metal Men. You can spend a decade bringing those characters to life, the way they were in that era (when they were at their most popular). It's exactly what Marvel did. I have no idea why DC can't figure that out.","3/10"

"Black Adam","ocastro-byu","3 December 2022","Literally the only redeemable quality of this movie is that the actors are attractive. That's it. I just don't understand how the people who land these jobs to make movies are hired. No one in a long list of ""professionals"" said hold up this doesn't make any sense or that bit is garbage? Who are these side heroes and why do they have power? Why was the first king not a champion? Why did the new champion have to sit in a chair to summon the dead? If Brosnan could see into the future, why didn't he pull Adam out a lot sooner to avoid all the calamity? Why is Adam the only native (5000 years old) with an American accent? I can go on and on. More than the loop holes, what bothers me most is his writers keep dishing out the same trope of hopeful and annoying adolescent who believes in the hero (sorry not hero...) more than the hero believes in himself, providing for a really lame arc. Also, said adolescent will repeatedly make stupid decisions putting himself and others in danger by needing constantly to be saved. Let's give him a cape though like he's 5, which he'll wear the remainder of the film ugh. And ""intergang"" honestly sounds like a NSFW subreddit. If Hollywood writers can be successful writing this garbage, I definitely need to switch career paths.","1/10"
"Incredibles 2","Anthonyjkb","10 November 2018","Good: The animation for this movie was excellent just like most other Pixar movies, it was funny (especially Jack Jack) and I really liked the action sequences throughout the movie. I liked that the movie showed that parenting (when done right) can be heroic.Bad: I thought this film has quite a few problems, the biggest problem was that the ending was pretty predictable, I could see it coming. Also, there was a feminism theme with Helen which was okay but at times it seemed to shove it in my face and it got to be annoying. There seemed to be a little too much going on in the movie and a few too many characters.I'm glad I saw the movie, I just don't think I would see it again anytime soon.","7/10"

I recommend seeing CinemaWins ""Everything GREAT about Incredibles 2"" if you want to see why this film is still pretty decent. Only somewhat weak spot in my opinion was the main villain who was somewhat predictable, but man the animation at times truly is ""Incredible"" (pun intended)!Go see it! It was well worth my time and I enjoyed it, so I'm surprised to see it get all these 1 star reviews. Far from Pixar's best but still a good flick.

"Incredibles 2","TheLittleSongbird","30 July 2018","Have always been a big fan of Pixar, liking to loving pretty much all their short films (particularly 'Presto', 'One Man Band', 'Geri's Game', 'Piper' and 'Knick Knack'). Also like to love a vast majority of their feature films, my favourites being the 'Toy Story' films, 'Up', 'Coco' and 'Inside Out' and my least favourites being the 'Cars' sequels and 'The Good Dinosaur'.While not one of my favourite Pixar films, 'The Incredibles' is still a very, very good film that has gone even higher in my estimations after a well overdue re-watch to get myself prepared for 'Incredibles 2', fantastically animated, exciting, funny, emotionally investable and ground-breaking with great characters. Expectations were high for its long awaited sequel fourteen years on, and while it is not as good a film, and what could and should have been super and incredible wasn't quite, on the most part 'Incredibles 2' was worth the wait.'Incredibles 2' does lack 'The Incredibles' originality (not much new here) and its emotional impact and character development is also not as good, the latter particularly is noticeably thinner (Bob for example was more complex before). It was a little too long for a story as slight as it was, would have trimmed it by 15-20 minutes and tightened the first act's pacing with it taking a bit too much time to get going.Like others, among my biggest problems were to do with the villain. The villain was forgettable (one of Pixar's weakest easily), the twist concerning their identity that was too obvious too soon. Found their plan convoluted, that when explained made me want a re-wind button which was not possible in the cinema, and the motivation was pretty weak and extreme, took a while for me to get my head round. While the characters are fun, it did feel like there were too many, not sure whether it needed that many superheroes that aren't given enough to do other than in the climax.However, it may sound like 'Incredibles 2' was a bad film. It wasn't. Actually enjoyed it a good deal. The animation is fantastic, smooth, vibrant in colour and meticulous in background detail, some very striking details, a richly immersive setting and the characters are well designed. Michael Giacchino's score gets one in a rousing mood while also being dynamic with the action. The action is superbly animated and thrilling with real suspense and excitement.Writing has many moments of humour that provides a lot of laughs (Jack Jack steals the show here, especially with his powers and his fight with the racoon, with some nice lines later from Edna), moments that probe thought and drama that's relatable and never too sentimental (if not as poignant as one would like). The story does grip, more so in the Elastigirl story that really held my attention before the villain reveal underwhelmed. The family drama stuff is also very prominent, and while it is repetitive at times and there could have been less of it the best moments are very funny and it is very easy to relate to the dilemmas the characters face. Pacing mostly excites when things get going.Character development is nowhere near as strong here and it would have benefitted from less characters and more done with the existing characters and more thought with the villain and their plan/motivations, but the characters are mostly fun with the highlight being Jack Jack. The voice acting is terrific, especially from Holly Hunter, Craig T Nelson and Samuel L Jackson. Brad Bird is a lot of fun in Edna's small role and Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks are good additions.Overall, very enjoyable but wanted to like it much more. 7/10 Bethany Cox","7/10"
"Incredibles 2","NarniaIsAwesome","2 October 2018","'Incredibles 2' was probably the most anticipated movie of the year; it's hard to believe it's made 14 years since the first original. So obviously everyone was more than ready for this.The film does come through when it comes to entertaining action and comedy, with Jack-Jack, Bob, and Edna providing most of the biggest laughs. The plot is interesting, because we've got to know what happened to the Parr family. As far as the supervillain mystery, it's acceptable and somewhat entertaining, but a bit predictable and generic. The final criticism I have is that Edna definitely deserved more screen time.That being said, it is still an entertaining movie and not at all ""painful"" to watch.In conclusion, 'Incredibles 2' is funny, exciting, and really worth a viewing.","7/10"
"Incredibles 2","Lejink","9 February 2019","I loved the first ""The Incredibles"" and remember wondering why a follow-up hadn't been made soon after its success. Better late than never you might say but personally after watching this 14-years later sequel, I'm tending to better never than late. Somehow, for me, the movie just fell flat and didn't please me to anything like the degree of its predecessor.Don't get me wrong, the Pixar animation is fantastic as always, but somewhere along the line, the story, characters and humour lack something. The outlawed super-heroes / aliens / mutants theme has been done to death, from the X-Men to the Marvel Civil War right up to the current Supergirl TV series, likewise the husband and wife role-reversal with Mr Incredible's turn as three super-babies and a super-dad again seemed old-hat while Elastigirl's elevation to solo superstardom also felt a little like a forced and belated concession to PC-dom.I'm trying now to remember a really funny, laugh-out-loud line or memorable eye-popping sequence and I find I can't. The sub-plot of Violet and her young beau reminded me of any number of ""Married With Children"" episodes with like I said, a lack of good gags, plus Dash's characterisation was just irritating and new shape-shifting baby Jack-Jack (what kind of name is that?) even more so.For me, I found the film really dragged in places with its too predictable villain and unmemorable climax which no amount of flashy graphics could disguise. In truth I think that this sort of thing was done way better in ""Megamind"", ""Despicable Me"" and of course the first Incredibles feature.At leat I can't accuse it of being a quick cash-in but really this is one set of retired super-heroes which should have remained on the shelf.","3/10"
"Incredibles 2","Darth_Osmosis","3 August 2018","There is much to like here and not much that is outright wrong or bad. It's funny, fast paced, clever and overall works quite well. However there is an ever present feeling that the first one was better..

It's still good, just not great!","7/10"
"Incredibles 2","planktonrules","17 January 2019","I hate most sequels and don't think most of them are necessary...they are just an excuse to squeeze money out of the popularity of the first film. This is especially true to kids' films in recent years an it seems like a bazillion cartoons and CGI movies have been made and remade in a cynical attempt to make money. Are they any good? For most, I'd say no. However, I am happy I saw ""Incredibles 2"" as it was worthy of the franchise and offers enough new content to make it worth your time.In this follow-up, super-heroes have been banned and the Incredibles family is not about to break the law. However, when an eccentric billionaire offers to help the family rehabilitate the image of heroes in an effort to get them unbanned, bad things are in store. It's not that he is evil....but someone around him has an agenda of their own. In the meantime, Mr. Incredible is forced to become a house husband...and he struggles with learning to parent effectively and live without using his super skills. Ultimately, however, the entire family is forced into action to not only save the day but Mrs. Incredible.Of all the recent kids films, I must say that ""Incredibles 2"" has the strongest feminist message. This is NOT a complaint. I liked seeing Mrs. Incredible become the family breadwinner and Mr. Incredible learn to be tender and a caregiver. There are also other feminist aspects of the story...but I'll say no more since it would spoil the plot!Overall, an incredibly well animated and thoroughly enjoyable film. Not exactly original (hence a score that isn't higher), but well worth seeing....unlike the countless ""Ice Age"" sequels and the like.","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","randomStuff101","20 November 2018","Half way through watching this in the cinema, I thought ""maybe it's me"". Maybe it's my fault I'm not into this movie.

It lacks flow, it's just a bunch of scenes one after the other, there's no coherent thread or curious elements tying it together.Nice visuals goes without saying, but the story is let down by a sense that it's been engineered around a board room table by people referring to their social media feeds for inspiration, rather than dreamt up by talented writers.Sure, some scenes are fun. But we're not watching a youtube playlist here, this is a movie and it's supposed to work as a whole, not just momentarily.The script is uninteresting, the action is exciting sometimes, but other times you just want it to end or move on. Very disappointing.Toy Story 2 was a great sequel, but this is a very poor sequel. Forgettable.If you love the first, then hold onto that because it doesn't get better. It gets worse.","4/10"
"Incredibles 2","SnoopyStyle","29 October 2018","This follows after the first movie. Superheroes continue to be banned. The family battles a supervillain causing havoc in the city. They become outcasts, unemployed, and penniless. The wealthy Deavor siblings, heads of the tech company Devtech, recruit Frozone and then the family to make superheroes great again. They convince Elastigirl to be the face of the revival while Mr. Incredible has to play Mr. Mom.Generally speaking, this is fun. It's a solid superhero movie and a fine family adventure. There is one hilarious scene with Jack-Jack and a raccoon. The only misstep is wiping Tony's memories. It would be so much more compelling for Tony to know Violet's secret and have them deal with that. It would make the young romance much more powerful and more dangerous. He could be a damsel in distress or he could slip up with the secret. There are more possibilities with him knowing. I would like Dash to dial back the bratty kid act by a half level. This continues to be great for the loving family at its center. I love Mr. Incredible figuring out how to use Jack-Jack as a laser gun. It's a fun movie and a fun franchise.","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","Anurag-Shetty","15 July 2018","Incredibles 2 continues with the adventures of the Parr family including, Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible(Craig T. Nelson), Helen Parr/Elastigirl(Holly Hunter), Violet Parr(Sarah Vowell), Dashiell 'Dash' Parr(Huck Milner) & Jack-Jack Parr(Eli Fucile). This time Helen is out being the superhero, while Bob stays at home & takes care of the kids. Incredibles 2 is a supremely entertaining film. Writer-director Brad Bird makes sure that the 14 year gap between The Incredibles(2004) & this sequel, is definitely worth the wait. The animation is flawless. The 3D is eye-popping. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. The humor is another strong point of the film. The talented cast who have lent their voices, make this movie unforgettable. Craig T. Nelson is outstanding as Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible. Holly Hunter is spectacular as Helen Parr/Elastigirl. Sarah Vowell is brilliant as Violet Parr. Huck Milner is superb as Dashiell 'Dash' Parr. Catherine Keener is amazing as Evelyn Deavor. Eli Fucile is adorable as Jack-Jack Parr. Bob Odenkirk is awesome as Winston Deavor. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as Lucius Best/Frozone. Michael Bird, Sophia Bush & Brad Bird are great as Tony Rydinger, Voyd & Edna Mode(E), respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Incredibles 2 surpasses The Incredibles(2004) in every way. It's a must watch. I hope I don't have to wait for another 14 years, to watch Incredibles 3!","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","proud_luddite","2 September 2018","Following the superb 2004 original, the family of animated superheroes are back. This time, they are struggling to regain a good reputation for superheroes (ostracized due to the collateral damage of their heroics) while also getting caught up in fighting a scheme against Screenslaver, a villain who hypnotizes victims with TV screen images.The idea of Screenslaver seems clever and almost touches on the modern world's collective obsession with technical devices and other forms of media. It doesn't quite get to the heart of the matter and misses an opportunity to be a clever critique of our current times. The theme even seems to be jumbled and incoherent at times.But overall, the film is saved by funny characters and doing what action-filled, comical, Hollywood blockbusters set out to do: be entertaining. It also succeeds in adding a twist to the genre by having female characters in the centre of hero/villain conflicts. A rather smart move considering the current dynamic in the film industry. - dbamateurcritic","7/10"
"Incredibles 2","studioAT","22 August 2019","While it tried to be too many things and was overlong I found the first 'Incredibles' entertaining enough to see this second film eventually.Unfortunately 'Toy Story' aside Pixar don't seem to have a great record with sequels, and for me this film can be filed in the 'Monster's Uni/Finding Dory' camp, because while it's good, it's just not great.There are some nice moments, but again, it's too long, with too much time dedicated to Jack Jack, who wasn't really that funny the first time around.It all ends up being a bit predictable.","2/10"
"Incredibles 2","ModishMovies","14 June 2018","Since I already know you are going to rate this review as ""Not Helpful"" because I didn't rate this 10/10 stars, I figured I might as well start off by telling you how much I love the original Incredibles. The Incredibles (2004) is one of my favorite films of all time and is my second favorite Pixar film (right after Finding Nemo). I got to see Incredibles 2 early because I caught a double feature of the two films in IMAX, just in case you were thinking of complaining that I didn't see it since this review is out early. What I loved about the original was the authenticity that the story, characters, and animation had to it. It felt more creative, natural, and beautiful. Syndrome was one of the greatest superhero movie villains of all time, not because of the amount of damage he was able to inflict upon the world, but because of the emotional pain he was able to cause Mr. Incredible and his family. The moments in which Mr. Incredible regrets his past mistakes and realizes how his actions affect others, especially his former biggest fan, are what makes the film stand out from any other hero-villain dynamic. Sadly, Incredibles 2 does not have a villain or story as deep or as thoughtful as Syndrome.Incredibles 2 boldly and intelligently begins right where The Incredibles ended. This smart move on Disney Pixar's part eliminates all confusion and time gaps that may arise after a hiatus of any amount (especially fourteen years) between a sequel and its predecessor. The story that follows is relatively contrived and characters are clumsily introduced in order to expand the universe instead of expanding the emotions of the beloved characters. The action scenes are creative and well-animated, but they aren't memorable enough and take place in bland settings and accomplish nothing for the characters. There were many points during this film where I noticed how hard Brad Bird was trying to replicate the formula of the original film, but it became more and more noticeable to the point that it detracted from the story itself. The great Pixar films all have excellent, fluid stories. The great Pixar films also have superb plots that deepen our understanding and feelings for the characters. The good Pixar films have entertaining, sensible plots, but they rarely deepen our love of the characters involved in them, such as A Bug's Life, Cars 2 (don't hate me!), Cars 3, and The Good Dinosaur. Incredibles 2, sadly, falls into the latter category that has a fun, creative plot, but a plot that does nothing new for its characters.Since the villain is introduced in the trailer, I don't think that it's a spoiler to say that it doesn't feel authentic or inspired enough to be considered one of Pixar's best villains. While the motive for the villain is there, it is simply unnecessary, contrived, and unexciting. New heroes are also introduced (as seen in the poster and other promotional material). Many of them are underutilized or unnecessary. The film's weakest parts involve the newly introduced characters because they all lack the liveliness and creative spark of the original characters that are explored slightly more deeply in this film. But enough of the aspects of the film that let me down. For all of the disappointments, Incredibles 2 also has many surprises and amazing qualities. For one, Jack Jack's new abilities are basically perfect, both in what his powers are and in how they are revealed. At first, I worried that too much of Jack Jack's powers were revealed, but that was hardly the case. Jack Jack is actually one of the best parts of this film. He is easily one of the funniest parts of any Pixar film. I couldn't help but burst out in laughter every time he made a single noise. The humor in this film is slightly more present, or maybe more memorable, than in the original. The film's message also tries to be more important and necessary besides highlighting the importance of family.Obviously this review won't stop you from seeing this film, nor was it intended to, but I encourage all of you to see this film in theaters, but heavily reduce your expectations and don't think too much about what made The Incredibles nearly perfect, or you are sure to be sorely disappointed.","7/10"
"Incredibles 2","abcvision","26 June 2018","Superheros are back in vogue that's what the incredibles 2 is all about. Trying to make superheroes great again. As the family was put in hiding because they were outlawed, now comes an advocate trying to showcase the benefits of having these figures back on the street and out in the open. The movie does move slow and does not have the finesse of the first film. A few good lines but as in most sequels, that train has left the station. After a fun Incredibles 1, they had to disappoint with an Incredibles 2. Dr Wilson Trivino","3/10"
"Incredibles 2","sfgebel315","4 July 2018","I cannot believe it has been 14 years since The Incredibles came out. The gap between sequels seems to be getting longer, but the director, Brad Bird, said he wanted to wait until he had the perfect story. There's even a clip before the film starts where actors, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Holly Hunter tell us it will be ""well worth the wait""--and they were right!Though 14 years later, the film takes place minutes later. The first film ends with the Parr family having to fight the Miner who pops up out of the school parking lot, just after Violet gets a date with Tony. The sequel starts with that fight and we see how it backfires as the Parr family get arrested for destroying part of the city and because superheroes are still illegal. Enter our new characters, siblings Winston and Evelyn Deaver, who both want to help superheroes step back into the light, but they believe the way to do that is with Elastigirl. Therefore, our sequel twist is that Mr. Incredible becomes a stay-at-home dad having to babysit Jack-Jack and learning of his dozens of powers, teaching Dash ""new math"", and inserting his foot into his mouth when he tries to help Violet with her crush--all while Elastigirl is improving superhero relations. Personally, I thought the movie was predictable but perfect. I loved it for its simplistic plot that was not hard to figure out. I knew right away who the ""villain"" was and what their motivation was; however, I did not know exactly how the climax would occur, so I was still very much engaged. Not to mention there was enough character development and funny scenes to space out the predictable plot arch. Often times animated films are more for the adults who are taking the kids, then for the kids themselves. Most kids will not understand half the references, but will still enjoy the overall concept. At the same time, this film comes out when the kids who saw the first are now adults, possibly with kids of their own. Therefore, this film is a great blend of adult and child humor. I found it hilarious, and as a teacher, I particularly loved when Mr. Incredible stays up all night reading Dash's ""new math"" textbook so he can teach him new math, which was what it was called in the 60s (the time period this film alludes to) and is a shout out to our modern common core confusion. What I really love about this film is that there is even more Frozone and Jack-Jack, which brings me to my all-time favorite scenes--learning of Jack-Jack's powers, particularly when Violet and Dash call Uncle Frozone over because their dad is going insane from sleep-deprivation and trying to keep up with Jack-Jack. I lost track of how many powers he has and all I will say on the matter is that the best scene in the whole film is when Jack-Jack fights the raccoon. If you want a light-hearted comedy with some fun action sequences then this film is for you. If you loved the first one then you will love the second one. If you have not seen the first one, what's wrong with you?","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","Jack_C_","26 June 2018","We had low expectations going in. 99% of the time, Hollywood sequels are lazy productions that are made to cash in on the original's good will. Twenty minutes in, we happily realized that the writer/director Brad Bird actually put as much effort into this movie as he did in the original Incredibles.To echo every other reviewer- it was worth waiting 14 years. I will happily wait another 14 if the third installment is up to the caliber of #2.The animation is top notch and the script is surprisingly deep- Superheros are struggling to regain their lawful status in society. Violet is going through teenage dating pains. Family finances and stay at home parenting are heavy themes on top of the standard villain vs. Hero struggle.Still, it manages to be laugh out loud funny all the way through. Jack Jack's ability reveals are easily the funniest scenes in the movie, and we love the Poltergeist Easter egg. Wonder if Craig T Nelson had anything to do with it?Yes, the main villain is kind of weak and predictable, but that only took one star off. The story did drag at spots, as in the editor could have cut 10 minutes without losing much.Like the original, we will watch it again and again when it comes out on disc.","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","bornhard","23 June 2018","If you have seen lot of movies and read tons of comic books like myself it would seem predictable plus movie does have certain base plot elements similar to original. But don't run away yet because that is not fun part about the movie or what movie makers were focusing on, it was the family dynamics, role reversals and yes the much anticipated Jack Jack the Big bang in the small pack and all his wonderful powers which wreck havoc and yes make him most powerful member of the team.
 I can't say anything else without dropping spoilers but its a movie about a family that can be enjoyed by all families young and old together.","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","tk-williamson","15 March 2019","To say I was anticipating this movie would be a huge understatement. The first one was so amazing. One of the few movies that I have watched over, and over, and over. A straight forward and simple story that emphasized love, family, and good conquering evil. One protagonist and a very clear plot line. Who didn't get choked up when Syndrome sends rockets that destroy the plane the Helen and the kids are coming on to save their dad ""mayday may day, there are children on board!"" And the way they all came together as a team - so wonderful. Incredibles II is just too busy and goes off in too many directions. Too many new (repugnant and uninteresting) characters. I watched it through once and have tried on three occasions to re-watch it. I am probably selling it short and will enjoy it in the future, but that is my opinion at the moment.","7/10"

The graphics & humourous tone also set this film up as well!Although there were things in this film which didn't seem as good or as memorable as the first. First off, the female empowering propaganda was strong smelling in this one, political correctness seems to be shoving it's way down kids young throats & it's not on.

I don't know if it is because of too many cooks or what, but this movie is one huge mess, plus an editing issue (the memory wipe is in the wrong place). No resolution with the first villain. No demonstrated resolution for the main story. The Bob-with-the-kids stuff was too much of beating a dead horse. A couple of dozen supers that do nothing. The entire script should have been set on fire. To have to wait for fourteen years and end up with this is very annoying. To be fair, I viewed it and was disappointed. I waited eight months and viewed it a second time and just plain I hated it. After this, I doubt we'll see an Incredibles 3. What a way to ruin what could have been a great franchise.","1/10"
"Incredibles 2","drdeathforpresident","16 June 2018","The family is back fighting crime & saving the world this time in a not so comedic way, more so along the lines of ""leave it to beaver"" & ""father knows best."" The beginning starts off great, trying to save a city from total destruction - the whole family is involved here; when the smoke clears they relocate to a motel, their egos damaged but fate steps in and they again are moved to a swanky mansion with the works. Pops is stuck at home being the mother to the three rugrats especially the baby, Jack - Jack who as we see as the film drags on has these incredible (oh, you see what I did here?!) powers i.e. breathing fire & spewing out laser beams from his eyes (best scene involves Jack Jack and a pissed off racoon) - whilst elastic mom tries to save the city from a villain who leaves his victims in a trance; the film bounces back and forth to the father teaching his kids life lessons then wham! back to the scene of the crime that being 'elastic mom' trying to save a monorail from flying off the tracks.

"Incredibles 2","Quinoa1984","25 June 2018","Yes, it lacks the gigantic heart of the first movie (or the rather adult conflict within the family unit; here, Bob kinda feels like 'damn Im emasculated by my wife' for a scene and a half, but then thats dropped because Super-Baby, who is never not funny and steals the show in a fight with a raccoon, takes center stage in the sub-plot), but so what? Brad Bird is 5 for 6 (and even the weakest one is still pretty good), and shows why he's one of the vital comedy/action filmmakers around. I also dug how for a few scenes this kind of turned into hypnosis-laden V for Vendetta for kids (when it is already a bit like Fantastic Four meets Watchmen for kids).I kept wondering who the voice of Eleanor was; when I saw in the credits it's Catherine Keener, it suddenly makes sense why the character for the first two thirds of the movie moves exactly like Keener does. I also found there's a point Elastigirl and Eleanor have a conversation about gender roles and it suddenly occurred to me, ""wait... This is happening in *this* movie? Will anyone point to this movie being woke as a heart attack?","10/10"

"Incredibles 2","Floated2","24 September 2019","The original Incredibles movie released in 2004 was fresh, exciting and uniquely different from other animated films at the time. Of course now with this sequel being 14 years later, the animation is just as great if not better but the overall film isn't as good and entertaining. Having not remembering too much detail about the original film was remember enjoying it and thinking it was special, this film is a letdown.Not as great action, humor isn't as good and the plot is somewhat bland and has too much of a focus of Elastigrl being the major focus instead of the entire family. Also it is entirely predictable and the basic setup has been done many times before. It was very obvious from the beginning that it was a setup and that either Winston or Evelyn (or both) we're simply using Elestigirl, and that they were the villains. As it turned out it was only Evelyn.The baby having a unique set of powers was a nice touch but that camera little late. Although this film isn't that long (less than 1hr 50mins excluding end credits) it feels as if it drags on.Overall, for a highly anticipated film to have waited 14 years to be released, it was disappointing. The studios waited too long. Given the huge box office success, we hope the third film won't be as long to be released.","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","davispittman","25 June 2018","I am a big fan of the first incredibles film, one of my favorite animated features. It was very well made, and many of the good things they did in the first film is in this one too. I loved the chemistry between all the characters... the same great chemistry from the first. The actors all did great jobs with the voicing of the characters. Helen Parr/Elastagirl really shines here, she is the main focal point throughout the majority of the film, and I was glad she was because its so entertaining to see Helen kick butt, and it was fun to see Bob/mr incredible have to stay home and try his best alone with the kids. Being alone with them proves very hard, especially when Jack Jack starts experimenting with his powers... Which leads to some very funny moments. The villain was voiced well (Catherine Keener), this is a spoiler but honestly I could who the villain was early on... I think Evelyn was a pretty good villain, not the best I've seen but still pretty good. The first incredibles is nearly impossible to live up to completely... and this sequel doesn't but its still a really good film and a worthy sequel. 8/10 for Incredibles 2.","9/10"

"Incredibles 2","benjamincallinicos","19 November 2018","While Pixar may have been slipping up in recent years with films like the Good Dinosaur and Brave, this sequel felt so fresh and they only reused two jokes from the original film. I had a great time watching it and the family was just perfect from start to finish with Frozone along for the ride.I loved all the moments where Bob has to look after the kids as that was so relate-able and really made you understand how parenthood works. Finding out that Jack-Jack had powers was really hilarious to watch and watching Edna Mode bond with him really took the cake.The whole villain while really tightly woven in, was not so good. The villain was really cleverly revealed but I could see it coming a mile off. It was a bit predictable, it's something that we've seen a million times before.But once again, this sequel was passable thanks to the really funny dynamic between the whole family we've grown to love.

"Incredibles 2","trw-98462","22 June 2018","Having grown up in the 2000s and being an advid fan of animation and superheroes, I'd be lying if I told you that I wasn't entranced by Disney Pixar's Incredibles from 2004. Fast forward fourteen years and I found myself sitting in a movie theatre with a bunch of other twenty year olds excitedly waiting to watch its sequel. But was Incredibles 2 able to reach the high bar set by its predecessor?I'd personally say yes. This movie was an incredible success!I just love how Incredibles is able to expertly mix superhero action with the struggles faced by your average family. When they're not fighting crime, the members of the Parr family find themselves dealing with basic human predicaments, like trying to raise a baby and figuring out how to do math homework. These two genres may not seem compatible on paper, but Incredibles is just able to make it work. This results in Incredibles being a truly unique feature.Of course originality alone isn't enough to make a film great, especially if the writers are unable to compose a comprehensible story for their film. Thankfully, the plot of Incredibles 2 was able to exceed the basic fundamental requirements of storytelling, especially for a superhero film. Yes, the plot is somewhat predictable and it is honestly quite simplistic at its core. Nonetheless, the story is executed quite well, and there are relatively no plot holes present in the movie. Although the story is fine, what I found to be a major highlight of the film would definitely be the characters, specifically the protagonists.Each of the main characters added their own little flair to the movie. Helen takes the spotlight for a decent portion of the film, and viewers got to see her awesome crime fighting abilities as Elastigirl. Violet was pretty amazing in this movie. She went through development as a person, as a superhero, and had some pretty hilarious moments like when she squirted water out of her nose. Dash also showed some character growth in the film and he ended up being an enjoyable presence. When it comes to Bob, I do wish that the creators would have showed off his prowess as Mr. Incredible a bit more in the film. But since he got some enjoyable scenes as a stressed dad trying to take care of his children and was the primary focus of the first movie, it didn't bother me too much.The biggest surprise for me ended up being how great I found the Jack-Jack scenes to be. I couldn't believe how entertained I was by the antics of a baby in a movie, and he actually wound up being one of the most memorable parts of the film for me. Returning characters like Frozone and Edna maintained their charm from the previous movie, and some of the new characters ended up being pretty decent as well.I simply can't finish this review without talking about the breathtaking aesthetics of the film. The animators really outdid themselves with the movie's technical aspects. Expressions, movements, and scenery were impressively well animated, and the visuals have set a new standard for animated movies. Of course, this is to be expected. The creators did have a solid fourteen years to make this film as spectacular as possible you know.Overall, I was genuinely satisfied with Incredibles 2. It maintained the quality of the first film and even surpassed it in some aspects. Pixar did a lot of things right with this movie. And if you're unsure of whether or not to watch it because ""it's for kids,"" I would wholeheartedly recommend giving this movie a shot. I doubt that you'll be dissapointed by it. It is a pretty incredible movie after all.","2/10"
"Incredibles 2","corpse_man","20 June 2018","First of all, this movie is nothing but a giant piece of propaganda. I was a huge fan of the original Incredibles, and it's quite sad to see this new film reduced to nothing more than a means to push radical neo feminist ideologies.To summarize the plot, it's basically about how Elastigirl is a more competent superhero than Mr Incredible, and so she gets chosen to be the face of the new superhero resurgence, while Mr incredible stays at home and looks after the kids. Not surprisingly, the movie emphasizes how poorly Mr incredible is at handling his new duties at home. The main message of this movie is that Elastigirl is just as good or better than Mr Incredible at superhero work, while Mr Incredible is vastly inferior at taking care of the kids and home life in general. So basically, he is just all around inferior to her. Or let's just say it out loud, Men are inferior to women. That is the real message of the film. Ironically, it was actually released right before FATHERS DAY!!!Now if so many other movies were not packed with the same sort of blatant propaganda recently, I could probably just right it off as part of the plot, or just originality or whatever, but since almost every big budget movie recently is so full of similar plot lines, it's quite clear what it really is. PROPAGANDA.In the original Incredibles movie, Elastigirl and Mr Incredible were equals. They both had strengths and weaknesses, and in the end she ended up saving him. I loved that movie. It was about a loving family and about equal partnership. This new movie however, Mr Incredible and Elastigirl are not even close to being equals. he is completely incompetent and demasculinized, while she is vastly superior at pretty much everything. AS I stated previously, this fits in with the modern trend of movies, which seems to not only put Women in postions of power (which is great) but also seems to greatly emphasize their superiority over men. This needs to stop. Especially on a movie released just before fathers day. Like seriously?WE are basically telling our children they don't need fathers and don't need to listen to their fathers or respect them, because they are just completely incompetent, second rate people. I would NOT let my children watch this movie!","4/10"
"Incredibles 2","rustydalek-37911","28 September 2021","When Bob relives the glory days, it's bad. When Helen relives the glory days, it's good. When Bob stays home to parent the kids, he sucks at it. When Helen stays home to parent the kids, she excels at it. That's basically the narrative that unfolds from watching both Incredible films together.The plot of this is sequel is a tired, inferior rehash of the first one. Superheroes are still illegal (in spite of the fact that the original film implied they were accepted again by the end). Somebody invites Helen to relive the glory days, and agrees, which is odd after her reaction to Bob doing so in the first film. When she does, she discovers a new villain, and spoiler alert! The villain is actually one of the people she is working for. There's a bunch of antics on the side, and then a boring battle on a yacht with a bunch of poorly animated ""new superheroes"" who do NOT fit the aesthetic of the film at all. All in all, the sequel does nothing well, and brings nothing to the table. It's basically just the first film all over again, except with a female syndrome and a male mirage (being the Deavor siblings), and Mrs. Incredible reliving the glory days instead of her husband. I'm not going to sit here and claim this is some kind of overt ""feminist propaganda"". I don't know what the intention was, but there seems to be a theme of Mr. Incredible being a failure at everything, so take that as you will. What I will say that this film is a victim of lazy and uninspired storytelling, and Pixar can do better.","7/10"

This leaves Mr Incredible as the house husband and he discovers that baby Jack-Jack has incredible super powers as well.The story is not too deep, if you have seen other Pixar films, you could maybe guess the ultimate villain. It does have lots of action packed fun, frenetic animation and children will certainly enjoy it.","2/10"
"Incredibles 2","ladawnclarepanton","22 July 2018","My 14 year old daughter loved it but I was bored stiff. Nothing new. Nothing surprised me. Nothing interesting. The first one was hilarious and unexpected. This wasn't. Wait for it to go on TV. Save your money.","4/10"
"Incredibles 2","Maz-hell","3 July 2018","I watched the first movie around 10 years ago. It was a very good movie: The animation was incredible for the time, the story was pretty deep and complex, the universe was explained, the action was amazing and the characters were defined. It was a very good experience and I actually recomend it.The second one is... just that. The second one. Let's put the good first, because I know your finger is already twitching in the ""this is not useful"" button: The animation is flawless. It is extremely detailed, even physically acurate. And the action scenes are good: Whole action with no thinking required. The music and sound design are solid, if not simplistic until the credits roll and you actually hear the theme song for Frozone (You rule man).Speaking of thinking... The plot is really bad. Painfully lazy. It goes into Nazis at the center of the earth territory. It is so painfully predictable that you only require 15 minutes to predict the (not at all surprising) villain, its completely flawed logic and reasoning and even the final sequence. Also its plan is so incredibly dumb it falls into irony when it fails because of how much effort it used on making it fail: It helps the good guys, it gives them the means to defeating it and even gives them enough time for them to save the world. It was pointless.The humor is ""Jack jack is a baby doing baby things but with superpowers. Laugh."" It fails unless you have the brain capacity of a 6 years old. Or you have a very simple sense of humor, and I mean simple. As in ""somebody got hurt or almost. Laugh."" Also called the ""early youtube syndrome"".Also they tried to develop a baby as a character... why?. You have a teenager that has teenager problems, with no development on her character. Or an arc. Violet is actually better defined in the first film! She was a shy teenager, learning how to interact, learning to love her family, learning to control herself and to be responsible. Here she is just there... being the deus ex machina. Dash is just there too, not being even a good deus ex machina, unless activating remotely a car and causing property damage counts as it. Mr Incredible is just being there, not learning anything and failing to evolve, only lies at himself and others to cover up his errors and to learn nothing. I can't reinforce that point enough: he learns nothing.Elastigirl is just an independent woman that needs no man... wait a minute... no no no no... don't you dare... Yes, you did. You broke your own movie universe disney. You did it. You transformed a fully alive family where everyone had an arc, everyone was learning and everyone can progress and everyone is learning into a joke where only the mother and the baby are important. Good job.The morale is... pffft... keep dreaming. The first one teached you that everyone in your family is important even if you can't always tolerate each other. This one teaches nothing. It is completely devoid of meaning.Pointless.Also important: The first film actually has a heart: It makes you feel emotions, excitement, the characters actually try to resolve problems, they can interact with a natural pace. You are actually afraid for their lives when necesary. It actually warms your heart. This one can't. It is just pointless joke after pointless scene about pointlessness.In short: An empty premise kills a 14 years old masterpiece. Stay with the original.This is only a full-action animated soul-less cashgrab.","9/10"
"Incredibles 2","Quantom-X","3 October 2018","It's been a long wait. 14 years since the first film and at long last we get the continuation of the story. This movie picks up right where the first one left off. Supers are back in the light and the public opinion is mixed as always with the law not taking too kindly to the Incredibles' efforts.
Honestly with how the movie goes, I can see that their really wasn't much else they could do with the story or where to take it and it still feel like Incredibles and carry the same spirit as the first film. It could easily have just become just another super hero movie with the family stopping some big threat or some other. They went deeper with this story and kept the similar tone of the first, and it works wonderfully. It may be more of nostalgia talking, but the first film still seems to hold up better. Then again I've only seen the sequel once in theaters so far. I was not disappointed and think the movie was wonderful.
Just hopefully we won't have to wait another 14 years for part 3... if we ever get a part 3.Also. Whats up with the girl Evelyn looking almost identical to Roxanne in Megamind?","4/10"
"Incredibles 2","littlemankazoo","15 June 2018","Let me spin you a bit of a Greek tragedy here; Coming back to a world and characters I loved 14 years ago when I saw the original at my 8th birthday party, only to discover something terrible.I'm not going to sugarcoat it: Incredibles 2 was IMMENSELY disappointing.Even as I sat in the middle of a dark theater, filled to the brim with people who were laughing and enjoying a film that seemed to turn so many nostalgia dials in the room...I just could not join them in letting my nostalgia glasses take control.Because, in the end, with nostalgia put aside, this is a HEAVILY flawed film, and considering it's something of this magnitude, I simply can't let that slide.So, with that said, let's slip our Nostalgia Goggles OFF for a moment, and let's begin...shall we?'Incredibles 2' has been hyped for lord knows how long, as it is perhaps one of the few worlds that Pixar (And Brad Bird as well) created that had something to build-upon and create something new and different with a second installment. Unlike films like 'Cars 2' or 'Monsters University', a sequel truly felt necessary in a world where the market has become so saturated with superhero films. With all that considered, it seemed like a no-brainer that another Incredibles film could work in this current landscape and provide a new outlook on the genre of superhero films, just as the original film did back in 2004.Only problem is, I think they forgot to write a new film.My main gripe with 'Incredibles 2' is just how recycled and empty the entire experience feels. The film, without any self-awareness or irony about it, essentially carbon copies most of the plot-threads from the original film, only switching it up to provide parallels to the original. While this could have worked if executed cleverly, we instead receive these same plot points, played-out by different characters, but lacking most of the depth the first film.The film intends to use Helen as the main character this time, which initially intrigued me in that it was an interesting twist on the original to give Elastigirl the main action/conflict and giving Bob the family struggle after we saw his story told in the original. Instead, however, we get a Helen sub-plot that feels so half-baked and without any depth to it, it truly might as well have just been pulled from the film and we would not have lost much.None of the conflict of the original film is present. The themes of family and the struggles that come with being that are so surface level it borders on the cliche in some respects. Helen is given NOTHING to be her own character in this, and instead is given action scenes to play-out and a sub-plot that only serves to remind me how much better the first film was. Rather than giving us a great and in-depth character plot for Helen, we get something so weak and honestly regressive for how hard this film brandishes itself to be a feminist advocate that I would dare say it's offensive how shallow Helen's character arc and story comes off in this.Bob's story arc doesn't fare much better. The concept of flipping the script and giving him the family to run and learning how to be a proper father on his own is an interesting way to parallel the first film and the story it gave him...but instead, we are only given small glimpses at the depth this story can provide.Instead, make way for funny comic relief Jack-Jack scenes! Watch him fight a cartoon raccoon for 5 minutes! Watch everyone try to take care of the baby for 5 minutes! Funny poop joke! Funny baby sound!Hopefully, you're beginning to see my point. This film, for all its attempts to TRY and prove it has depth and a reason to exist, lacks all the depth of the first film and lacks a reason to truly exist.I found myself asking, at some point in the theater, ""Why does this film NEED to exist?"". Why did this story need to be told? What does this story tell us that the first one couldn't?I think the answer is simply this; this film exists because it was going to make money.This film feels so unnecessary in the thick of things. After 14 years, you mean to tell me you cannot do anything better than copying the plot of the first film, then writing a screenplay that lacks any of the depth from the original? You can't give us a compelling, introspective story about Helen dealing with being an extremely famous superhero AND a mother? You can't give us a deep story regarding Bob balancing being a father and his wish to be a superhero again? You can't give us ANY reason to invest emotionally into this film?That, quite frankly, is frustrating beyond belief.Not everything is bad in this film, much as I am deriding it. In fact, there IS a lot of fantastic stuff in this. The animation looks spectacular in every scene, the action scenes are actually tremendous to watch and were the few times I had my eyes glued to the screen, and the brass-y and jazz-y score by Michael Giacchino is just as excellent as the first film's. Indeed, there ARE great things in this film.However...if you're going to make us wait 14 years to do something new with this endlessly-interesting world you built, you need to do something NEW and INTERESTING with a sequel like this. Not copy the first film, attempt weak commentary that has already been done better in other media, and expect us not to notice otherwise.I'm tremendously disappointed in Brad Bird. I'm tremendously disappointed with Pixar. But most of all, I'm tremendously disappointed with 'Incredibles 2'.But hey...at least we still have the first film, right?","3/10"
"Incredibles 2","bj-bijaya","28 June 2018","Let's get straight to the point. I don't need to write SPOILERS here, simply because Incredibles 2 is exactly like its predecessor - The Incredibles.The Incredibles is still my favorite film. But with so much of anticipation and expectation, watching the second edition made me feel just that, ""I was watching The Incredibles again!""The Incredibles starts off after Mr. Incredible wrecks the city. Same thing in II. The family has to go under hinding. Same thing in II. Someone has to take up being a superhero again. Same thing in II. One parent is caught up with parenting. Same thing in II. The fan becomes the superhero. Same thing in II. Parents get into trouble. Same thing in II. Children save the day. Same thing in II. Bigger eminent threats arrive and everyone joins hand to become the Incredibles. Same thing in II. The villain is destroyed by his own stupidity. Same thing in II. The daughter finally gets the guy. Same thing in II.Director / Writer Brad Bird took a genius step over a span of more than a decade to come up with a story that could well become the second part. He Xerox'ed the first film, hoping that young minds would not realize. But what he did not expect is that there are REAL Incredibles fans out there, and they do remember every scene, every dialogue of the film. Wrong move, Mr. Bird.And yes, the action sequences are way less in this IInd version. One more star taken away just for considering the fans dumb.","9/10"
"Incredibles 2","vinniec-53536","14 March 2019","'Incredibles 2' picks up right where it's predecessor, 'The Incredibles' left off, with the titular heroes, the Parr family, thrust into an exciting new adventure. The plot focuses on Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl, with the help of millionaire businessman Winston Deavor and his sister Evelyn, trying to make superheroes legal again, while Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, stays home with the kids. When a new villain emerges with a dangerous plan to turn the general populace against Supers, the Incredibles, along with family-friend Frozone, must band together to stop the rogue. I found it humorous how Bob and Helen's roles are reversed from the first film, but it's refreshing and it works. I found the story very compelling, with the perfect combination of action, mystery, suspense, and humor. Unfortunately, the film's antagonist, The Screenslaver, isn't as compelling as the first film's villain, Syndrome. Screenslaver's identity is kept hidden for most of the film, with clues here and there to keep you guessing. Ultimately, it's not too difficult to figure out who is under the mask, but it's still an interesting mystery. Most of the cast from 'The Incredibles' returns for the sequel, and once again do a stellar job. The animation has greatly improved from the first film, with the characters and scenery looking better and more realistic than ever. One aspect of this film I especially enjoyed is that we see more of the Parr family working together to take down the bad guy, with even the kids, Dash and Violet, helping to save the day. The film's standout character is without a doubt the Parr family's youngest member, Jack-Jack, who is a delight to watch and steals every scene he is in. Overall, 'Incredibles 2' is pure fun and enjoyment from beginning to end, and I actually enjoyed it more than the first. Much like 'The Incredibles', the film's ending leaves the door open for another installment, and I immensely hope we get to see 'Incredibles 3' one day, because I can't get enough of this 'Super' family.My Rating: 9.5/10","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","CriticalOfEverything","28 July 2018","Whilst I didn't expect it to top the original, I can safely say that Incredibles 2 is a little bit below, but in terms of enjoyment I'd say it's about on par.The story sort of follows the same structure of the original, but still has enough new ideas to make it stand out as different.The writing is funnier than the original, hell sometimes it's outrageously funny. But it's still pretty dark at points like the original, so you don't have to worry if you think The Incredibles has been dumbed down to a full on comedy.There's a lot more action than the original, which is a good thing because it IS a superhero movie, but it isn't completely filled to the brim with ongoing action so there's time for actual storytelling and plot progression.The animation is absolutely fantastic. It's stunningly detailed, expressive and stylish. Just like the first Incredibles, actually, except the fact that Incredibles 2 is obviously going to look grander than it's predecessor from 14 years ago.The characters are still great and they haven't changed a bit, all of them are just as lovable as before. But the new villain, Screenslaver, is quite a disappointment. Screenslaver's a decent villain, but when compared to Syndrome there's a clear step down. Plus, the twist for who Screenslaver is is very predictable and I could see it coming a mile away.The soundtrack is fantastic, it's great to hear the Incredibles theme again after so long and it's used in different styles to match the scene now. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I thought that because modern Pixar is a bit of a mess that I'd get a cash grab but it instead I got a well made and excellent movie that deserves the 2 in it's title. I will just address the whole feminism thing people say it's promoting. YES, there's a slight feminist message that you can only see if you really dig deep for it. But unlike that of the new Star Wars movies, it isn't shoved down your throat and is more ''equal treatment'' than ''kill all the white men'' so stop saying it's propaganda, coming from a male by the way.","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","Clank_Zoka","15 July 2018","Many people were waiting for a sequel to one of the best animated animated films of all time from Pixar, I still like the first Incredibles to this day, it's funny, thought provoking, relatable, action packed, has great characters, stylish animation that has hasn't aged badly at all and Brad Bird takes a simple premise and plot but made it bigger and relatable and that's what I like about his work like the Iron Giant, Ratatouille and the first Incredibles, so the Incredibles was a child good favourite and I still remember watching it when I was young, one of Pixar's and Brad Bird's best I've seen.So when I heard the sequel was getting released this year, I was really pumped and ready to see the Parr family back in action and trailers certainly helped, now that it finally came on Friday the 13th (least it's wasn't bad luck) in the UK and I got a chance to see it the day after it got released and....... not surprisingly I love it!, it's a little better then the first one honestly, so how did it improve?.Well the plot about Helen Parr or Elastagirl (Holly Hunter) taking Bob or Mr. Incredible's (Craig T. Nelson) role from the first film which is she is been given a oppertunity to bring superheroes to not only help the rest of the Parr family but also try and make superheroes legal again, while Bob takes Helen's role from the first movie which is to look after the kids, Dash, Violet and Jack-Jack while Helen is out to do secret hero work and try and take down a new villain Screenslaver before he hypnotises everyone in the city, so it may be slightly formulaic and predicable, but it sure did a great job of doing the best it can, throughout the whole thing I was hooked on what going on, the plot is executed smoothly and the two plots with Helen and Bob connect quite well with each other, everyone actually has a part to play instead of being there, the movie still has it's great humour and there are some memorable moments of humour that evolves Jack-Jack, there's a subplot with Violet that is having a problem with her date and that got interesting since she's my favourite character in the film series, however as brilliant, clever and well executed the writing is, the movie still has great heart, especially with Bob and Violet, but sometimes it just plays it for laughs instead of taking it seriously which does kind of ruin what makes the Parr family relatable, especially at the restaurants scene which didn't really help, that and the reveal of who Screenslaver is which may not be who you expect but at that reveal moment, it becomes slightly predictable, but those are nitpicks, the movie still has originality, good heart, great laughs, it's actually more adult then kid friendly like the first movie, you care about these characters and it gets more interesting and it all comes together nicely.The animation is a massive upgrade from the first movie, the animation in the first movie did look great back in the day and it hasn't aged badly or anything, but it's starting to look not quite as brilliant as it was in 2004, however I still like it, but this animation has improved a lot, the movie looks more colourful, each character's design may look the same from the first movie but here it has a nice upgrade to them, The Parrs looks so much better, the backgrounds and the city looks more down to earth, when not using their powers, the characters has a smooth but slightly cartoon movement, but it's mostly down-to-earth, the action scenes are very creative and fast, when Jack-Jack or the rest of the Parr family use their powers it actually looks really cool, although if you get seizures from flashing images, i don't recommend this movie though because the villain Screenslaver has TVs that he uses to control his victims and in a fight that has TVs with lots of flashing images, so yeah that can be debatable, but besides that the animation is massively improved from the first movie and it looks fantastic!.The characters are still entertaining and memorable as they were back in 2004, even the new ones has a lot to offer, the Parr family is still great, Helen is a well developed character who gets even more screen time and her plot gets very interesting, Bob still has his funny moments and is still a likeable father, Dash might be annoying to some but I found him entertaining enough, but Jack-Jack and Violet stand out for me, Jack-Jack brings some great laughs with his different powers and Violet is one I found interesting and I did care about her the most besides the Parrs, Lucius Best a.k.a Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is still awesome, the new characters are also great, well mostly, Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) is charmingly and delightful character who I like all the way through same with his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener) although he remind me of Sterling from Cars 3 at times but I still liked his presences, the other superheroes like Voyd, Brick, Reflux, He-Lectrix are basically just other heroes but they do play a part like i said before, the villain Screenslaver had potential to be a great villain but came out as disappointing, the reveal of who the Screenslaver is can come off as predictable and the villain's plan did start off interesting but then it made no sense and Buddy Pine is so much better, but how can I forget Edna Mode voiced by the director himself Brad Bird, she still is really fascinating, funny and very entertaining when it comes to her and Jack-Jack, but at-least the voice acting is still amazing, Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson return and they are still great as they were before, the new ones like Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk, Sophia Bush, Jonathan Banks and many more do a fantastic job as well, but even with a weak villain, these characters old and new are still loveable and wonderful just how they should be.So maybe not quite as well crafted and important as the first film, but it still has what made the first movie amazing, it has an engaging and original plot, the animation is fantastic as always, loveable characters with great voice acting, really good humour with great heart and amazing action, this is high recommendation, if you love Pixar, the Incredibles or superheroes, please do go check this one out, along with Deadpool 2, this is one of the funniest superhero films of this year, I can't wait to see what Brad Bird makes next.Of course I'm going to give Incredibles 2 a 10/10!.","3/10"
"Incredibles 2","bornbranded","17 June 2018","This movie is getting so many effusive critic and fan reviews, of which I did not know until after I saw it. I was hoping, after logging onto my IMDB account, to see a bunch of concurring negative opinions that could have made me say 'You should have looked at IMDB, before seeing this turkey.' What I see, instead, is shocking. I must say the same thing about Isle of Dogs - I don't know how you people like that (or this) film.  Best part of the night out, for seeing I2, was this Asian themed animated short that comes before the main showing of Incredibles 2. Incredibles 2, itself, lacked a good story, the twist could be seen coming a million miles away, and it had absolutely no irony or complexity to the characters. Characters were all one-dimensional, stereotypical and uninteresting.As someone who enjoyed the original, I am disgusted with how much praise and money a third rate film like this has garnered, when so many other films have merited much more attention than this piece of crap.","4/10"
"Incredibles 2","Neptune165","18 October 2019","Fun, but stupid writing. i was so disappointed, i watched the first movie just to compare and it definitely isn't better than the first one. I felt like I was always waiting for the main story to begin but it seemed like it never did and felt cliche. This movie was really bad in my opinion. love the characters, love the animation, the plot sucks & doesn't make much sense considering the first film. if u watch the first than the second you will be like ""wait what? why r they complaining about supers being illegal??"" the first film already fleshed out that idea, yet this movie pretends as if it didn't. In about the first hour i lost interest i just didn't care anymore the first one was classic and waited to long to make a 2nd. Not gonna lie i felt they went a little to hard on the feminist stuff. AND I SUPPORT LEAD FEMALE ROLES. In the first one bob leaves and does what he has to do but in the movie the women comes and saves him. See? The first movie was perfect. However in this one bob suffers with the kids. Kinda like oh idk the implication that a man can't do it like a woman can. Kinda sucks but I hope the 3rd one can fix and kinda ""battle of the sexes"" bs however cool that bob kept It together. just let me enjoy an animated movie about superheroes without throwing that feminist stuff in my face every 2 seconds. If I watch superheroes I want to see them having adventures, that's the point. if I wanted to see ""family problems"" ""parents taking care of the kids"" and all that.","9/10"

"Incredibles 2","admin-16582","23 July 2018","This movie is not about family like the first one!Having a strong female lead is great, but emphasizing their superiority over men, over and over, joke after joke, just made this movie unbearable. That is not equality!The first Incredibles movie brought the entire family together as a whole and was solid, one of my all time favorites. Even though the Incredibles 2 started off good and it was funny (at first) with how Mr Incredible had a hard time with the kids, it never ended. As the movie goes on and on you soon realize what's happening because it's not subtle. The boys can't play because their masculinity is too destructive, so Elastigirl has to go solo to restore their image, but she's really just being tricked by an even smarter female who has an idiot for a brother (he just happens to be the President of a huge telcom company). Violet's character is developed as she matures and is beginning to understand the world as well as her powers. But, Mr Incredible and Dash are just kinda punching bags to make fun of and serve no other purpose. Other than us seeing all the powers Jack Jack has, he really doesn't do anything either other than cause problems. Sure near the end the whole family sort of gets involved, but they're mostly just taking turns running after Jack Jack. The movie really should have been called ""Elastigirl and Friends"".To sum it up, the story was boring and predictable. They had a certain direction to follow with the feminist agenda and the writers probably did the best they could. But if you think I'm crazy, even the film's producer Nicole Paradis Grindle confirmed that its feminist premise was years in the making. This movie taught my daughters that family only gets in the way, masculinity is dangerous, men are stupid, and women are victims. It's worth noting that my first review was declined by the IMDb staff using a general ""does not meet guidelines"" reason, which simply means that person doesn't agree with me and chose to censor my review. This is my opinion and view of the movie, and your bias should not be used to censor your opposition to further promote your agenda.","3/10"

"Incredibles 2","ironhorse_iv","21 July 2018","Following the success of 2004's Pixar Animation Studio's computer-animated superhero film 'The Incredibles', Walt Disney Pictures really wanted a sequel. However, writer & director, Brad Bird held off development to do other films. It wasn't until his last movie, 2015's 'Tomorrowland', bomb at theaters, that he returned to the project, in order to make the producers happy, while also try to salvage what left of his career. Because of that, I don't think, personally, Bird had the same heart & desirer for this, like he had, during the original. After all, it kinda shows in this film's script. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the story is pretty much a rethread, just with more poorly done foreshadowing and callbacks. Instead of Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr (Voiced by Craig Nelson) being recruited by a private company to do superhero work. This time, it's his wife, Helen/Elastigirl (Voiced by Holly Hunter) being chosen to, and now, Bob is the one, stuck at home, stressing out, while taking care of the kids. The only few differences comes from the overall tone. The first movie's is a little more fun & unique, as it portray superheroes in an bright, gratuitous 1960s spy genre adventure style, while the sequel takes the more murky atmospheric neo noir pulp detective mixed with 'Body Snatchers' horror approach to the main story. Because of that, the movie's vibrant, retro mid-century designs are not that endearingly nor as beautiful to look at, like the original. Thus, making the movie, a bit misty. Parts of the movie, was even hard to watch for some audiences, as the strobe lights used in the villain fight scenes cause them to suffer epilepsy. As for the rest of the action. While, less violent & fewer body count than the first movie, it was entertaining, but it lacks the overall family dynamics for a film called 'Incredibles 2'. They barely team up in this film. It's sad, because the climactic battle of the original, made them seem like they would fight crime together, regardless, what laws may say, and what challenges may come. Yet, the sequel drawn out, unnecessary excuses for the family, not to. It's highly annoying, because, the kids at this point, are very knowledgeable with their powers, when face with danger. As for the struggles of them, living in a 'herd morality' society. It's not that fresh nor does it make any sense worth continuing in the context of the last movie. That clash of beliefs has already been tackle greatly with the Übermensch through man-made technology VS Natural God-Given Abilities storyline from the original. It didn't need to be, recycled yet, again with a similar, yet predictable new villain. Nevertheless, I kinda dig the smart cautionary tale of allowing the perception of media to supplanted reality & dictated control of our lives for good, or for wicked means. That part of the main story was somewhat captivating to watch. Too bad, it wasn't explore to its fullest, due to the many interferes from producers. Just think, how much more powerful, the film could had been, if they went with the original idea; superheroes vs computer AI. The same can be said, if they kept the baby storyline as the main plot. The idea of uncontrollable somewhat powerful toddler wrecking society with his body horror could had been very fascinating. Sadly, instead, the movie choose to moves around, way too much with too many mini different subplots. Thus, making the sequel, a little unfocused, badly paced, & muddled. Not only that, but also full of jarring plot-holes, bigger than the school on Saturday debate and the Elastigirl hypoxia question. After all, one of the hardest things to believe, in the movie, is that the family doesn't know, about the baby's powers within the three months, timespan, they spent together in a cramped motel. I can go with the idea that the villain from the last movie, not killing all the superheroes, due to them, not being well-known, but the idea that the family doesn't see the baby's abilities really did take me out of the movie. Nevertheless, the story, is a lot better than non-canon 2005's video game 'Rise of the Underminer', but not unique enough to outdo the 2009 non-canon comic adaptation of the first film. It was bit lackluster in creative in that sense. As for the jokes. It was a mixed bag. Some of them, flew over my head, such as the 'New Math' sequence. Being a millennial, I didn't get it, but most of the others jokes, were funny. The only one that I had a problem with, is the joke with the baby fighting the raccoon. It's not like the animal was stealing, anything of value. It was just searching for crumbs to eat in the trash. That sequence make the baby, look like a total psychopath. Despite that, the animation overall for the movie was pretty damn good. Since, Pixar no longer, used the same computer systems from the original. They had to create everything from scratch. Because of that, we got more crisp, vibrant and detailed effects. It really does look amazing. With the exception of a few performers, most of the original voice actors and actresses returned to their respective characters. This is a bit impressive given how long the production gap was. Not only that, but they were all great in their roles. As for the newcomers, they were alright. However, nobody from that field was really that memorable. As for the music; composer, Michael Giacchino's jazzy score for this movie was just as good as the first film. The nostalgic tunes were catchy to listen to. Overall: In the end, ""Incredibles 2' still turn out to be, somewhat great; even if it doesn't match the majesty of other Pixar sequels. Still, I think a lot of people will enjoy this film. It delivers as much of the joy, pathos, and adventure as the original. It's worth the price of admission. It's super, too.","9/10"
"Incredibles 2","CANpatbuck3664","22 June 2018","The animation in the original was great but this movie took it another leap forward. Having seen the original so many times, it took me a bit to adjust to it, but the movie never ceased to beautiful or have something imaginative. The attention to detail is insane (Bird has a reputation for being nitpicky, so much so that the animators of the original partially modelled the character Syndrome after him) and there was never a moment was I wasn't impressed or even blown away by how stunning this movie was. Adding on top of that, I would stack the action scenes in this movie up against any modern superhero blockbuster. They are thrilling, and I would even say astounding. My favourite was the runaway train scene. I hate to keep playing the same note, but I think the visual style in Incredibles 2 is as impressive if not more than any animated movie I've seen in the past couple of years. I also understand the worry about triggering epilepsy because one of the fights features a lot of flashing lights. I thought it was a sensational scene but the warning is warranted.Moving from the animation to the characters, Bird and his team do a good job developing the familiar and introducing the new. Instead of Bob/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) being the main character, the focus shifts to Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter). I was worried when I saw the trailer, not because Helen was the hero, she's a great character and my trepidation was never about the story having a feminist slant. But the husband not being able to handle the family duties is a tired thing, it's been done over and over and this movie calling attention to it seemed counterproductive. Is anyone offended by a stay-at-home dad? It was a temporary arrangement and I feel like we've gotten past that being weird. Anyway, Elastigirl is a great hero and her narrative was compelling. I liked how she bounced off of her new corporate backers Winston Deaver (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deavor (Catherine Keener) and while those character play to the actor's strengths (Winston isn't Saul Goodman but he's not too far off), they had plenty of personality. I'll talk more about Bob later, but I also liked how Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Dash (Huck Milner) hugged the line between having issues yet not being too bratty. Violet is pretty moody throughout the course of the movie, but they give her a nice moment near the end that compensates. Luscius/Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is a funny returning character but he drifts in and out of the movie, I would have liked him to have more screen time. Everyone's favourite characters are back in Edna Mode (Brad Bird) and Jack-Jack. Jack-Jack was a riot and I loved almost every second we got to spend with him. Edna stole the show in the original and while she doesn't get more screen time, her appearance is pitch perfect. They go with the less is more plan with her and she's just as effective as Bob's suit designer/confidant. 
Looking back on the trailer, a lot of the more annoying moments actually ended up being some of the better bits of the movie. Bob trying to handle Jack-Jack's endlessly varied power set was hilarious and although the movie centres around Elastigirl, the war on the home front occupied my attention completely. I still did find some minor problems however. Incredibles 2 shows off Helen's abilities superbly and she capably anchors the film. But on the downside, I thought the movie betrayed Bob's abilities as a superhero. He defeated a robot in the original that killed dozens of other heroes, yet he can't handle someone who has never tested their abilities in the field? I approve that the movie put Mr. and Mrs. Incredible on more equal footing (I'm also good with Helen being the more professional hero which is what Incredibles 2 seems to insinuate) but they didn't have to bring Bob down to build up Helen. I wish we had gotten more opportunities to see the family fight together as a team. As the trailer shows, the family each has their moments but rarely as a group. It doesn't detract from the action but the fight scenes with the group together were wonderful in the original and I wanted more of that. I would also comment that a lot of the subtext is going to fly over a younger kid's head. Its nice that they include adult friendly banter about complex issues, all the best family movies can appeal both to adults and kids. But I doubt kids are going to understand much of the debate that fuels the villain's motivations. I watched the original entry before going to see this and it only inflated high expectations. The Incredibles is a masterpiece and it should be regarded as one of the best superhero movies ever made. This movie had a lot to live up to and despite some minor stumbles, I think Incredibles 2 comes close. It boasts some phenomenal action, the animation is top notch and while some of the story elements were better handled then others, I still left the theatre impressed. At worst, I took a couple of small issues with the progression of some of the characters, which is a relatively minor complaint. If you've been waiting for another adventure with the Incredibles, I think you're going to be pleased. Pixar makes phenomenal movies when they're firing on all cylinders and this movie is no exception. I highly recommend this to fans of the original and newcomers alike.","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","pjgs200","23 June 2018","Incredibles 2 was a great movie. The characters were all written wonderfully, it's genuinely funny and loads of fun to watch, and it's a satisfying sequel to the 2004 film that brought joy to the whole family. While watching this film, there were moments where I actually said ""this is awesome"" while watching the film. It's just so great to see these superheroes back in action after 14 years, and it's funny and exciting throughout. I loved seeing the whole family trying to resolve issues while fighting crime.I do think that the villain in the film was both underdeveloped and pretty easy to spot. From the first time we meet her and her brother, we know something's up, so it wasn't a surprise that one of them was the bad guy. I also think that the scene where Elastigirl is in that electric cage was a bit of a mistake on the part of the animators and the directors. Although I don't have epilepsy, it was still uncomfortable to watch, and that scene makes it harder for those who do have epilepsy to enjoy the film. Overall, Incredibles 2 was a really fun and satisfying movie. 8 out of 10","9/10"

This movie should have been a straight to video releases. I don't know why everyone is giving this movie such rave review. Maybe they just enjoy watching a baby shoot laser beams from their eyes and that satisfies them. As always, you have to compare this to the few 'perfect' movies out there.

"Incredibles 2","Jared_Andrews","19 June 2018","Fourteen years after the original, writer/director Brad Bird returns to helm the second installment of The Incredibles. The movie landscape has changed greatly since then. Many moviegoers may not realize that The Incredibles came out four years before Iron-Man, which launched the ""Marvel MCU."" So, for any fans who love superhero movies, don't just thank Robert Downey Jr. for kicking things off. Thank Brad Bird. For fans who are tired of the oversaturation of superhero movies, still thank Brad Bird because The Incredibles is a truly wonderful film.The sequel doesn't quite reach the lofty standard of the original, which would have been nearly impossible, what with the originality and seminal nature of film, the characters and the exceptional villain. But Incredibles 2 does boast improvements to the visuals. I advise you to sit relatively close and take a good look at the detail of every scene. The lighting, the color, the movement-it's all immaculate. In a visual sense, this movie is a marvelous achievement. The weakest aspect of the movie is the villain. The villain is obvious, predictable and unclear in his or her ideology. I get the sense that all the necessary pieces were there, but the filmmakers couldn't quite put together the puzzle. Fear not, the villain's shortcomings are certainly not enough to spoil the movie. It has the appropriate blend of action, thoughtful commentary for the adults and silly jokes for the kids. I opted not to mention the plot at all because I thought, ""why bother?"" The Incredibles have to stop a villain, and they also deal with other issues. Great, you get it. Now go see this movie.","9/10"
"Incredibles 2","highmarksreviews","12 July 2018","The Incredibles 2 has finally arrived and after a long wait does what few sequels can and probably should. It lives to the hype in the best of ways possible. Worth noting is that this movie might just be one of Pixar's most visually stunning and vibrantly animated pieces yet and that just adds extra atmosphere. The cast is terrific, with welcome returns from fan favourites giving solid performances to the franchise's fully realised characters. The story is simple, yet interesting and has several side elements that are incorporated very well. The idea of a larger superhero world and their legality is discussed with a narrative that is surprisingly mature and conscious of the message it wants to convey. The action and overall spectacle is beautiful and creative, even if its not as large-scale or grand as the first one. I will say though, Incredibles 2 has gorgeous scenery, an awesome cast and a great story, but it has a villain problem. ScreenSlaver isn't really connected to the world in any meaningful way and ends up being a one-off baddie with only a few memorable moments. But, in the end, the movie is still a win, and manages to tie up loose ends from the first and open up new doors for possible new instalments, which I honestly hope are yet to come.
 
The good: Visual design and clean animation, Performances from the cast, Good story that tied into the original, Great new characters as well as recurring older ones, Creative and vibrant action sequencesThe bad: Main villain is a little off and forgettable, Some characters may feel a little under-utilised at times","2/10"

"Incredibles 2","IsabelM11","23 July 2018","(I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum)
I really don't know what to say about this film.As someone who absolutely loved the first one and went into this one desiring to love it as well, I was extremely disappointed and just incredibly confused. I have a number of issues with it, but let's get into the first one.Tone: Not every film in a series/sequence needs to maintain consistent tone, I get that. But the first film has always stood out from other animated movies, because of its serious tone and mature themes (children and adults can enjoy it). This movie feels like a different franchise entirely. It lacks all the high stakes, emotion, and seriousness of the first film. Consider just a couple moments from the first film: the plane crash scene, the scene where Mr. Incredible threatens to kill Mirage, the scene where Buddy gives his ""it's bigger, it's badder"" monologue, the scene where Mr. Incredible realizes his fellow supers are dead and is then absorbed by black slime, or when Elastigirl considers that Mr. Incredible might be having an affair when she finds a white hair. Any one of these scenes is more complex, emotional, and interesting than the entire Incredibles 2 film. The second movie lacks any sense of stakes or seriousness. It felt like the most dumbed down version imaginable. The first film was so smart in its approach and dialogue, and the characters felt realistic and intelligent (the fight between Elastigirl and Bob when he comes home late). This film has lost all of that completely. For example, the scene where Elastigirl is talking to the sister and says ""are you asking the believer or the cynic?"" was possibly the most cringe-worthy, out of place dialogue I've ever heard. Like they were trying to intellectualize a moment so hard it just felt forced. Even the color scheme of this movie felt jarringly different and so saturated, like the colors were turned up to the max. The first film had a color story that made sense: it's grey and depressing when Bob is working, explosion of color once you get to Nomanasan. There's a development of color that is both metaphoric and makes sense. This film's color story felt childish, which would be fine if it was just a children's movie. But it's apart of a franchise that's first film was an iconic masterpiece with mature yet fun themes, and in that respect it is seriously disappointing and difficult to watch.Plot: Most predictable plot ever made. As soon as you see it, you know the siblings (sister) will turn out to be bad, and that she's controlling screen slaver. And of course Elastigirl finally gets her turn to save the world and Mr. Incredible + family will have to go save her (a reversal of the first movie that at first seems creative then becomes almost too predictable). And I have major issues with the villain. They are literally fighting people who can be calmed down if they just remove goggles. Characters: What happened with the characters? They were all dumbed down versions of themselves. Even that scene with Dash where he can't pronounce decimals, which was supposed to be family friendly and cute, was just irritating and felt dumb for his character. Elastigirl was over the top to the point where she didn't feel like herself. Bob was the... same? I guess, but had zero development. Violet, who I get is going through her angsty teen thing, is okay. Even the minor characters, Edna aside who was fine, like the guy who helps them relocate each year was off. In the first film I appreciated his seriousness and matter of fact style, which appeared cold but you could tell he actually cared. Even he felt crazy different. It actually hurts me to continue critiquing this film, so I'll stop there despite the many other issues I had with it.","3/10"
"Incredibles 2","DawnOfCreation","21 June 2018","I just watched The Incredibles Marathon. I didn't like part 1 en part 2 was just as bad. I didn't like the humor, didn't like the story and in general dislike the way they made this animation movie. They try to turn a normal action movie script into an animation movie. That's not what's animation is about! Animation goes beyond the realm of possibilities. It just doesn't feel good. It's too boring for me, visually not impressive, and overall mediocre. When you look at animations like Tangled, or Toy Story or Frozen you get pulled away from reality right into this wonderful world of magical animation. The incredibles pt. 2 is the exact opposite!Maybe there are people on this planet who like this kind of animation, but it's definitely not for me! And I'm a hardcore animation fan. Watch the trailer and decide if you like what your seeing, if you don't, save your money!","4/10"
"Incredibles 2","writers_reign","31 July 2018","Apart from vintage Disney - Snow White, Bambi - I tend not to watch animation but I was struck by the way several critics in National newspapers lauded this title and laboured the point that it was as entertaining for adults as it was for children, if not more so. On that basis I gave it a whirl. Not having watched the first title I had no idea of who was who, if there were any recurring villains etc.
I didn't even know that - like Superman - they were only part-time super heroes, a typical suburban family who, in times of trouble, are able to assume powere beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. There seemed to be some mileage in a storyline that had the matriarch saving the world whilst the patriarch stayed home and played house husband. I can't say that I was moved to dash out in search of other Pixar titles but I did watch to the end.","8/10"

"Incredibles 2","AustinOswald","12 June 2018","Incredibles 2 was smart, action packed, visually stunning, and HILARIOUS! It's everything you expect from a Pixar movie minus the tears. Actually, scratch that. The nostalgia and the genuinely funny moments will make you cry of pure joy. I personally loved seeing these lovable characters fight their way through super villain mayhem on once again. Incredibles 2 takes place right where the original left off, so expect to jump right into the action. Some of these action scenes were so flawless and exciting that I could've sworn they were taken straight from a Marvel or DC movie. However, Pixar still managed to create original action sequences by using the Parr family's abilities in many creative and innovative new ways. The animation, lighting, and surface texturing was also something to marvel at. From the individual strands of Dash's hair to the wrinkles on Mr. Incredible's clothes, this movie was a detailed filled masterpiece. When using the word ""masterpiece,"" I must also mention Michael Giacchino's brilliant score. The Incredibles theme was brought back for this film and used in so many exciting new ways. You can tell Giacchino loved experimenting with this powerful score that he wrote over a decade ago. Be prepared for many laugh out loud moments in this movie as well. Jack Jack will melt you heart in one moment and make whatever you're drinking come out of your nose in the next moment. He really does steal the show. From a nostalgic stand point, this film did not disappoint. It hit all of the marks of a successful movie sequel and as a Pixar Fan, I couldn't be happier. All in all, this movie is a blast and will probably be amongst the top 5 movies of the summer. It DEFINITELY lives up to the original and some might even say it's better.","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","ferguson-6","13 June 2018","Greetings again from the darkness. In 2004 THE INCREDIBLES became the 6th Pixar film in a row to dominate the box office, and also the 6th straight to ""WOW"" us with a combination of animation, story, action and characters. All these years later, Brad Bird, the creative force behind the original, is back with the much anticipated sequel. Mr. Bird's career over those years has featured a blend of other animation (RATATOUILLE, 2007) and live-action (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL). Bird is not the only returnee for the sequel. Also back is the entire Parr Family: Holly Hunter as Elastigirl/Helen/Mom, Craig T Nelson as Mr. Incredible/Bob/Dad, Sarah Vowell as Violet, Huck Milner as Dash, and Eli Fucile as baby Jack Jack. The story picks up not long after the original ended. ""Supers"" have been outlawed, and the Parrs are in some type of Super Protection Program - similar to Witness Protection. Of course when one is a superhero, doing the right thing just comes naturally, and the opening scene finds them battling their old nemesis Underminer (voiced by Pixar good luck charm John Ratzenberger, who voices a character in each of the studio's films). Our heroes stop the crime, but cause significant damage to the city. This leads to our first social commentary when the powers that be scold the Parrs and inform them that the banks have insurance, and it's cheaper to let the criminals get away so that the damage is minimized. As superheroes non-grata, the Parrs try to go ""straight"" and live a normal life. That is until a powerful brother and sister corporate duo offer a proposal. Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deavor (twist that pronunciation just a bit, voiced by Catherine Keener) want to generate a PR plan to help rebuild the reputation of supers. The idea is to make Elastigirl the public face of the program by having her wear a body cam to show off her heroic deeds (in this age of 'pics or it didn't happen'). She's chosen over Mr. Incredible for economic reasons, and he's relegated to stay-at-home parent (or as we called Michael Keaton in 1983, MR. MOM - an unacceptable sexist term these days).
Elastigirl enjoys her time in the limelight, while Bob doesn't much like being just Bob. Plus he can't understand why they changed math, as he gets frustrated trying to help Dash with his homework. He's also challenged with Violet's teen angst over a boy, and even moreso over the discovery that Jack Jack has POWERS! In fact, Jack Jack has multiple powers, but as a baby, he has little control - though his battle with a raccoon is not a segment you'll soon forget. Also returning is Frozone - voiced by Samuel L. Jackson (minus his trademark ""MF'er), and costume designer Edna Mode - voiced by director Bird. Other new voices include (Odenkirk's fellow ""Better Call Saul"" castmate) Jonathan Banks as Rick Dicker, Isabella Rossellini as the Ambassador, and Sophia Bush as Voyd, one of the new generation supers (which includes Reflux - one you'll just have to experience). The big new villain causing problems for Elastigirl is ScreenSlaver, who hypnotizes large groups of people through their screens - more social commentary on our dependence on technology and the addiction/affliction we have toward device screens. The flood of superhero movies over the years since THE INCREDIBLES exposes the not-so-complex story in this one, but it's terrific that the film keeps much of the original look and feel, and yet brings something new ... baby Jack Jack is a star!Filled with the beautiful colors and art design we've come to take for granted from Pixar, the film also features some of the best action sequences you'll see in any movie. The train sequence with Elastigirl is simply spectacular - as is the final action sequence. It's also nice to see the flip in gender roles as Mom (Holly Hunter) takes the lead. Michael Giacchino returns as the composer and he blends in a touch of James Bond theme with his wonderful work. If the film needed extra credit (which it doesn't), certainly the inclusion of a ""Jonny Quest"" clip would qualify. Family films don't get much better than this, and even though it runs 2 hours, the closing credits feature the theme song for each of the superheroes, and could easily have been a short film unto itself.Speaking of short films, a Pixar tradition is to include one before new releases. This time it's BAO, a Chinese mother/son and food-oriented story from director Domee Shi (animator on INSIDE OUT)","2/10"

"Incredibles 2","bob the moo","9 March 2019","I still remember watching the first Incredibles film and liking it for what it was, rather than what it had been marketed as. I liked its darkness, and how much of the character and plotting seemed aimed at someone much, much older than the marketing had suggested. By contrast, Incredibles 2 seems much more interested in keeping things light and fun. This makes it a slightly 'lesser' film in terms of the detail and observational elements but does make it easy viewing. The plot sort of follows a journey for Mrs Incredible, but it doesn't really build it so much as use it - likewise any emotional knock-on for the other characters is the same. In terms of what plot it uses to get with this, it is obvious enough in terms of twists and direction, but it does the job.That job is producing plenty of enjoyable action and funny moments, and does so for most viewers of most ages. The lack of darkness helps this slickness, and the 1960's vision of the future design adds to the sense of fun with its nostalgic references and look. The voice cast are all solid, even if several of them are essentially doing what they are famous for (Jackson, Odenkirk). As a whole there is much to enjoy in terms of spectacle and laughs, but it doesn't run much deeper than that, making it a lesser film, but probably one good enough that you'll not feel the impact of that till you reflect back on it.","6/10"

"Incredibles 2","Semisonic","12 March 2019","It is a clear sunny day boding nothing bad, and then suddenly a random guy bursts in on a giant drilling machine, robs a bank and literally sucks it dry, making off to an undetermined direction with his prize.I can't help thinking that this is the best way to describe what Incredibles 2 did to its paying audience. I haven't paid a penny to see this film, but even I felt robbed, of my time, my hope for having a good taste in cinema, and - most importantly - my good memory of the first Incredibles.It's been 15 years since the first film had been released, but instead of going forward the sequel seems to have gone back in time, to the fantasy 60's that only existed in the James Bond movies. The super family, however, had frozen in time and looks almost the same, but those real life years have indeed taken its toll - in the form of Holly Hunter's voice, which now sounds as if Elastigirl is an elderly lady not yet accustomed to her new dentures. And that is just the first of many more stark contrasts between look and feel Incredibles 2 aren't able to hide.Another thing that deteriorated just as bad as Elastigirl's voice is the filmmakers' ability to distinguish quality and hollow filler. I don't remember all the details of the first film, it's been quite a while indeed, but I do remember that, despite intentionally goofy graphics, it felt real enough in terms of sincerity. That super family acted in a way that made you care, and the plot was a balance between keeping it reasonable and providing enough surprise factor.This time, however, we get a clumsy mix of hollow action scenes, generic parent-child moments, really forced promotion of gender equality and a dystopian anti-brainwashing message more fitting the bleak Blade Runner universe instead of the colorful tech-happy retrofuture. Watching the kids do kid stuff is now more tiring than cute, and the little family quarrels from amusing become ridiculous. Just like the new villain's persona and motive.Overall, Incredibles 2 made me realize once again that some things aren't meant to be remade or continued. Especially if you can't add anything new or fresh to what's been said and done earlier. And if you're not that good with creativity anymore, at least let your heroes grow up a bit. Because seeing kids not ageing a day in fifteen years makes one feel like John Nash from A Beautiful Mind, and that proved to be not the most healthy thing.","6/10"
"Incredibles 2","b2280545","18 July 2018","The Incredibles return in the highly anticipated sequel that fans have waited for 14 long years to arrive in theaters. The first Incredibles released in 2004 was a masterpiece of filmmaking for it's time and is part of Pixar Animation Studios's Golden Age of films along with past iconic titles Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo. What these films have in common is how they were able to touch the hearts of audiences across the world, as a result becoming cult classics. In the past, Pixar has produced sequels to their films from time to time, with the Toy Story franchise being the most popular and with the next sequel Toy Story 4 scheduled for a 2019 release, the franchise continues it's success. Cars and Finding Nemo both have had relatively decent sequels but this one was highly desired for the last fourteen years. That being said, there hasn't been nor will there ever be a case when a sequel to an adored iconic film is released that audiences especially fans of the original who hold it dear to their hearts will not perceive the sequel at first glance as inferior to the original. That can damage a film's reputation. Incredibles 2 does look different (the animation literally looks different) and yet is similar to the first film with a new twist. It's habit of bringing back the nostalgia that made the original loved is it's biggest strength. The film picks up right where the first film ended with the first superhero family facing off with the villain the Underminer giving viewers the idea of the kind of film their about to watch. One thing this film does well is develop each character's powers to new levels. For an animated film, the action sequences are thrilling, sometimes heart pounding and super fun to view. The music is similar to how it was before giving exciting 60's spy movie vibes. The best moments of the film are the ones where Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible is watching over his children while his wife is away saving the world, something we did not see in the first film was his relationship with his children. The theme of wanting acceptance in a world that hates you is back, a relatable subject in today's world for some people, and just as in the first film, it's presented well. Incredibles 2 is an enjoyable action packed superhero fest with a coming of age aspect to it. All the characters are under pressure by the world around them that's telling them how they're supposed to live their lives creating sadness and desperation for them. As time goes by, they must choose what they want to be. Pixar has always included deep emotional topics like this in their films all to their credit. Finally while the additional characters new to the film may not have been the most memorable Pixar has invented, it had an interesting story, entertaining action, a final act that pays off, humorous moments and seeing the characters return made the film worth the wait. It doesn't completely live up to the original though nonetheless it is a worthy sequel to one of the most successful animated films in history.","5/10"
"Incredibles 2","jljacobi","18 August 2021","You should watch this, if for no other reason than ""Aunt Edna"". Skip to that if you want.Other than that, this movie's got a feminist tone about it that you may, or may not appreciate. I will say that at least it doesn't castrate the male characters in service of the message.Decent movie, but it should've been called Elastigirl Goes to Town while Bob babysits and Edna steals the show. Not good enough to warrant a third.","9/10"
"Incredibles 2","iguth","7 May 2019","Incredibles 2 is a sequel too late. Of course it will be hard to make a sequel that lives up to the original and they didn't quite overcome that challenge. The movie picks up right where the first left off but it seems as if the previous movie didn't happen. Character growth from the previous film is pretty much not there and the Tony bit throughout the film is awkward. The humor is lost on me, I don't find much of it funny but maybe some do. The graphics, upgraded clearly to stay competitive in today's market, but it differs so far from the original that it feels out of place. I enjoy the twist of seeing Helen doing the work and getting to see Bob bond with his kids while supporting his wife. Edna is just as good and the suit rundown is just like before (which is a good thing). The big problems with this movie come from the new characters, villain, and climax. First the new heroes look very weird; they look inhuman. Winston Deaver is the only charming newly introduced character to me. The villain is not good. Dull, predictable, and trying to fulfill a poorly thought out plan are all ways I'd describe the villain. Finally the climax of the film. Why is there a hydrofoil? There is not reason for there to be a hydrofoil. Overall I have some huge issues with the plot but the action sequences are all great and the humor probably appeals to people that aren't me.","4/10"

It did a great job of balancing comedy, drama, the action scenes were spectacular and I LOVED the new supers they added to the franchise; Sophia Bush's Voyd was my favorite out of the new characters, she was dope.

"Incredibles 2","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","28 August 2018","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningOver a decade after their last big screen adventure, the Parr family, headed by dad Bob (Craig T. Nelson) and mom Helen (Holly Hunter) are performing their heroic deeds as their super-hero alter-egos Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, along with their kids Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Dashiell (Huck Milner), as well as baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile.) But their activities are still illegal, and their exploits have caused yet another public calamity. All seems lost, until millionaire Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk), launches a campaign to make superheroes legal again, along with his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener.) But a mysterious villain called The Screen-slaver plunges The Incredibles, and their cohort Frozone (Samuel L Jackson) into a battle where no one is who they appear to be...We seem to be under attack from a barrage of sequels lately, some to fairly recent films and others to films from a while back that never got their follow up when they were flavour of the month, such as this sequel to the animated 2004 superhero satire The Incredibles. That said, they will only ever make sequels to films that were in any way a success, and so the comparatively lukewarm fanfare this sequel received was telling in itself. I certainly took my time going to see it, even after being very impressed with the first one, not least because I didn't relish sitting in an auditorium on my own packed with noisy, screaming kids. So, of course, I went to see it yesterday on a Bank Holiday Monday, thinking it wouldn't be so bad because it had been out a while and the showtimes were less frequent (bad luck!!!) Sadly, I wish I hadn't bothered...The animation, special effects and action sequences are, of course, as amazing and impressive as ever, and will certainly bring spark and joy to the average young person (no gender stereotyping!), who will be dazzled by all of that without thinking of anything else. But whilst older, more demanding viewers will still enjoy the in-jokes and references to modern pop culture and social issues, they will be less impressed with a far less engaging or coherent plot than the original, as well as a really obvious villain you can see from a mile off. As many others have noted, there seems to be some really obvious interference from the female empowerment lobby in the proceedings, with Mr Incredible as the 'stay at home dad', while Mrs Incredible is off saving the world like a superhero should throughout, in a reversal of how it's been throughout the years.I'm not sure why this got made, other than as a cheap and easy way to make some cash. Original director Brad Bird has doodooed all over his original masterpiece with this pointless and flat offering, that came out of nowhere like a thief in the night, with no Incredibles to stop it. **","1/10"
"Incredibles 2","DeanAmythe","25 January 2024","Brad Bird has a knack for staging action that he gets to express even more so in animation, and if any argument is to be made for superhero films to move that medium, it's this. While a definite downgrade, especially in terms of plot, from THE INCREDIBLES, the supers didn't get to interact with their powers much until the final act in that first film (which was, of course, the point, and certainly no detriment) and that happens to be where this takes off, allowing many more showcases of dynamic action. Also helps that this looks fantastic, is frequently hilarious, and Giacchino's score never fails to excite. I know superhero fatigue is a thing right now, but I certainly wouldn't mind one of these every few years.","7/10"

"Incredibles 2","bigal_a","25 April 2019","When I heard the synopsis of this film, I feared it would be going down the social justice rabbit-hole as so many other popular franchises have done.My main fear was that Elastigirl was going to shine effortlessly and Bob was going to be totally out of his depth and incompetent. And in truth, there was some of that, and a little bit of feminist by-play between Elastigirl and Evelyn.But, to be honest, I think even super-mum Helen would have had her hands full with Jack-Jack, who shines in a scene where the baby fights a racoon, emerging untouched and the animal slinking away terrified.And Bob does get to grips with his enforced home life, getting the ever-enjoyable Edna Mode to look after Jack-Jack (which she seems to enjoy), so he can get a night's sleep and get back on his feet. So he ends up effectively and clearly teaching maths to Dash before an exam, and getting lovelorn Violet back on his side. Even when Jack-Jack returns, Bob seems reinvigorated, almost reveling in his baby son's burgeoning powers.Not to say too much about the climax of the film, but suffice it to say that all the kids play their parts, as well as some new supers with bizarre powers that the Deavor siblings have gathered from around the world.And at the end, Mr Incredible, Elastigirl and Frozone end up fighting as a team, together again.I liked it, and I probably will watch it again some time.","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","Pjtaylor-96-138044","21 July 2018","'Incredibles 2 (2018)' - sans 'The', for some reason - is essentially just a worse version of the first film, with its narrative playing out so incredibly closely to that of its predecessor that beat-for-beat comparisons are almost easy. How it took Brad Bird fourteen years to come up with this is anyone's guess. Its character arcs and overall messages actually feel as though they backtrack upon the original's, only to reach the same conclusions. Both this picture and even the first (or, at least, its finale) actually seem somewhat redundant due to this. The two narratives don't really feel like they connect all that well, considering where one leaves off and the other picks up, despite them carrying directly on from one another. What I mean is, while the main plot may flow from one piece to the other, many other threads and character arcs don't come together quite as cleanly. The only real positive this picture has going for it are some genuinely exciting and, at times, suspenseful action sequences. These moments tend to flow fairly well and provide some real, if brief, entertainment. In general, though, the film feels very subpar. There are some very poor character designs. The new heroes are honestly some of the worst characters I've seen, from a visual stand-point, in some time. They are actually difficult to look at and don't fit the aesthetic at all. Pixar should be producing better original characters than this. It may just be me, but the film seems slightly over-animated, too, and loses the 'realistic' look of the first, even if it is more impressively rendered. The flick's main issue is the writing, though. It feels off from the start. Overall, the movie lacks the narrative strength to stand on its own - thanks, in no small part, to some strange plot holes, poor motivations and weak characterisations. It fails to fully capture the quality or even spirit of the flick it follows. It also has a bizarre underlying philosophy that holds its very genre (or a subsection of it) - as well as the audience that enjoys such fare, which is apparently now oversaturated and underdeveloped (a debate best saved for another time), and even the increasing demand for that fare - seemingly in contempt while also playing entirely into the worst aspects of it and becoming the very thing - in concept, execution and intent - it appears to dislike. It ends up just another entry into a fading 'fad' with nothing new to add. 'The Incredibles (2004)' certainly can't be described as this, even all these years later. It's a shame, too, because this film didn't need to be better than that original feature, just a good one in it's own right. Honestly, it doesn't do a great job at that. 5/10","5/10"

"Incredibles 2","fabiogaucho","27 November 2018","This review will be buried under 800+ others, but I just had to put my homage to the movie here. I lost count of how many amazing set pieces. Yes, there is little character developement, but we already know those folks. The movie puts them in new roles, and that is enough. We already know the universe they inhabit, and frankly exploring social themes would be a waste of computer power. I could get through even the overbearing feminism, but that is probably because with so much netflix, PC stuff has beaten me into submission. Also, because the elastic woman is so well used. So I ended up enjoying Mr. Incredible trying to be a stay at home dad (and relatively succeding, giving the utterly impossible circunstances). Yes, the plot is predictable, but this is kind of expected in such an action-oriented flick. Jack-Jack gives enough surprises.Incredibles 1 was good, but it dragged at times, specially in the 1st half. This one will not let you down, it really puts everything into the action scenes, and there is never less then 10 minutes between them. The chasing of the Screenslaver in the building and the Violet/Voyd fight were my favorites. Introducing new people with new powers was a smart idea, and it works better here then in the overcrowded X-Men sequels. The ending is overdone, but in the age of Marvel movies, ending battles have to be overdone, it's kind of a rule. I just took this movie like a Mission Impossible sequel: give me nonstop thrills, without being overbearing, and that is enough.","6/10"

My problem had NOTHING at all to do with the movie having a female lead, but just that it was simply so uninteresting! Too much dialogue and build-up that never went anywhere, the characters were whiny, and I don't even think kids over 4 would enjoy this snooze-fest (if even then). What a waste of the past 14 years -- all that time passed and no one bothered to develop a clever or entertaining plot/script. My kiddo and I booked it immediately as the credits began to roll.

"Incredibles 2","educallejero","16 July 2019","(the better people) Smart presentation of the theme. With text and subtext. Almost everytime the movie talks about how special the superheroes are, we can replace that with the 1%.The villain of the movie shows how fake is the reasoning that the superheroes help the rest with their existence (superheroes are the 1%) and they need rules for themselves. The villain says that we (normal people) don't experience life and give up our liberties, freedom and consume the real thing from the safety of our homes, watching the screens (All true in real life, and I'm as guilty as anybody), while the 1% makes the decisions, have power and do and experience for real whatever they want. . The villain is the one that doesn't like the 1% (superheroes).While by text, the movie shows that all the superheroes (1%) want, is ""being treated fairly"". They want the rest to adapt to their exceptionalism ""for the betterment of the world"" (if nobody sees the ""don't put taxes on us and we would create jobs"", then what can I do? Because it is obvious to me).Besides that, the problem with this movie is that is boring. The lead character was Elastigirl this time. But they didn't go all the way. In the first one, we saw mr Incredible sad and depressed. So the scenes that weren't funny, had a lot of weight, which translated to the story rather well once it picked up the pace.
Here, Elastigirl doesn't have much of an arc. She was a bit indecisive at times, but, just in a few scenes, and it didn't impact the movie. The story was cliché as eff (the dad doesn't know how to do the mommy duties, while the mom was being held back by the antiquated stereotypes of having to stay home, but she's as good or better than the dad at everything).It's so.... boring. Violet's arc was so teen angs lame. Dash didn't have an arc (not even a short one) in this one. Tooooooo much focus on the baby with a gazillion of pathetic jokes (I don't think I laugh/chuckle once in the entire movie).So yeah, the animation improved and it was great, and the action was super fun. But what made the Incredibles better than the rest just wasn't there in this one.","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","bsilbor","4 July 2018","I remember watching The Incredibles back in '04 and was blown away by it. My 40-year-old father was even more excited than I was at the time. I won't fanboy over this sequel, but seeing these characters return as if there wasn't actually a fourteen year gap was a ton of fun and hilarious. I couldn't help but smile. The action scenes and the powers/technologies used in the scenes were so clever and fun and could really only be perfected in animation. Speaking of which, the animation (and this goes without saying, again given the fourteen year gap) was ten steps up from what it was in the original. Frozone's ice powers, Violet's shields, even the hair was incredibly realistic (pun 100% intended).There were a few slight things I felt could have been improved, though didn't hinder my enjoyment in any way. One is, as stated by many others, the villain. Syndrome was a personal villain going up against Mr. Incredible. A fan-turned-enemy. The Screenslaver was not personal, and their plan seemed a little convoluted and, because we only got a couple minutes of backstory, the motives felt lackluster. Their identity is also a bit predictable, as there are really only two suspects. But one other thing that was lacking, but not absent, was the depth of the characters. Bob Parr was so desparate to get back to heroics, that he totally dismissed his family. When he thought they had died, he realized what he was missing. A character arc like this was not present in this one. I will say, however, that the message the villain plays up is very topical. Waiting for superheroes to save the day is impractical and dangerous. It's up to normal, everyday people, the ""Joe Shmoes"", to fix the world if it's broken. Because in reality, there won't be a Mr. Incredible, or a Superman, or a Captain America to save the day. We are our own superheroes. We can't wait for a superhero to fix our lives...WE need to fix it ourselves.I've also noticed quite a few people claiming that the message of the film is that women are superior to men because Elastigirl got the superhero gig and Mr. Incredible was ""stripped of his masculinity"" by becoming a stay-at-home dad. No...it's just that Mr. Incredible had his time to shine in the first one, and now it's Elastigirl's turn. Disney didn't bring gender politics into the movie...you did.This was a great, but not perfect movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Hopefully it won't take another fourteen years for a third one.","3/10"
"Incredibles 2","Hellmant","15 June 2018","'INCREDIBLES 2': Four Stars (Out of Five)Pixar and Disney's long anticipated sequel to their 2004 animated superhero blockbuster 'THE INCREDIBLES'. The plot follows the Parr family once again, as they battle a new enemy, who wants to turn the public against all 'supers', while they also try to deal with normal family life as well. The film was once again written and directed by Brad Bird, and it features returning voice cast members including Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson. Huck Milner, Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk, Sophia Bush and Bill Wise also join the cast this time. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like it's predecessor), and it's also expected to be a huge hit at the Box Office once again as well. I enjoyed it, but definitely not as much as the original. The Parr family is still acting as the superhero team known as 'The Incredibles' when the authorities become too concerned about the damage being done during their battles with supervillains, and the team is ordered to halt their actions. Then they're contacted by a superhero fan named Winston Deavor (Odenkirk), and invited to his house for a proposition, along with their friend Frozone (Jackson). There Winston and his sister Evelyn (Keener) offer Helen Parr (Hunter) a superhero job fighting crime, in order to win back the support of the public. Helen accepts the job offer, and Bob Parr stays home to watch the kids while she works. Helen has to battle a new supervillain in the process, and Hank finds parenting even harder than crime fighting, especially when he learns their baby Jack-Jack has even greater superhero powers than they all do. The movie is really well made once again, and always beautiful to watch. The action scenes are mostly exciting too, and the humor is clever and witty (all once again). It's also great how progressive these films are, especially this time having the wife superhero be the one fighting crime, while the husband stays home to watch the kids. Of course he also finds parenting to be even harder than crime fighting too. That's all great about this movie, but it still didn't live up to my very high expectations of matching the original (or even coming close to it). It doesn't capture the same magic, and after the original film was so refreshing and somewhat groundbreaking at the time of it's release, there wasn't much this sequel could do to live up to it of course. It's still really well made though, and entertaining enough.","8/10"

I love these characters and Brad Bird has a gift for writing and directing. These two things are the only saving graces for the movie. Besides that, I like to pretend like this doesn't exist. It's so, so silly compared to the first one. Incredibles 1 had some moments of levity, but it took itself pretty seriously and had something to say about people becoming stagnated upon settling down, not letting their gifts and passions see the light of day. This one isn't really saying much. It's trying to hard to be funny and wastes its time on Jack Jack, math homework, and pointless side characters. Honestly, they should have set this one at least a decade in the future and focused on the kids now become adults, telling a different story with different lessons. The fact that this takes place seconds after Incredibles 1 ends deflates that perfect ending. They really didn't need a sequel, honestly. It'd be like (God forbid) making a sequel to the Iron Giant or Ratatouille, two other Brad Bird movies. These movies are self-contained and pretty flawless: they don't need sequels to say anything more. ""What happened to the giant?"" and ""what happened to Remy?"" are as pointless as asking what happened to the Parr family. Use your imagination -- the story has been told.","10/10"

The movie constantly force feeds how all of the sudden men are incompetent instead of simply equalizing the playing field (which is what most feminist preach, but rarely ever practice). They had at least 4 background characters in the likeness of Barack Obama while there was no likeness of any character at all to our sitting president of almost 2 years.

Cute family entertainment. Fun enough for adults. I liked the bad person who at one time sounded like the opening for ""Outer Limits."" ""You are no longer in control.""

"Incredibles 2","MrDHWong","14 June 2018","Incredibles 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the Disney Pixar classic The Incredibles. Written and directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, Ratatouille), it is a well-made follow-up to one of Pixar's best movies and a solid superhero film in its own right.A short time after the events of the first film, the Parr family, Bob/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner), and Jack-Jack, continue to protect their city from danger while also trying to live out their lives as normal citizens. One day, Helen is recruited by an organisation called DEVTECH, who are devoted to restoring the reputation of superheroes and regaining their popularity with the public. With his wife now away working for DEVTECH, Bob is tasked with looking after the kids and tending to their needs, which proves to be much easier said than done.The film is more action-packed than its predecessor and thanks to improved animation techniques, is far more exciting at times. All of the charm and familial love of the original film still remains in this sequel and once again there was a good balance of comedy and drama. Most of the original voice cast returns, including Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as Elastigirl, and of course Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone. In the previous film, it was the character of Edna who stole show in every scene, this time, it is the adorable baby Jack-Jack who gets the most laughs every time he is on screen. The only major issue is that the villain was highly predictable with generic motives and as a result was much less clever than Syndrome was in the original. Overall, this sequel was worth the 14 year wait and hopefully there will be a third installment in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8/10","1/10"
"Incredibles 2","domdom-63818","28 October 2018","It's just full of propaganda, I enjoyed it overall but almost every 10 minutes there was something new trying to brainwash me which I appreciated very little.The ambassador or whatever it was is a woman, that's fine. They added what seems to be some sexually ambiguous folk in there as well, which is also fine. They said Elastigirl is a better superhero than Mr. Incredible, they showed how great of a mother and super hero she is. Then they showed how crap Mr. Incredible is at looking after the house and everything in life to be honest, a complete disaster in fact.At the start they had to make sure Violets boyfriend tells us how he likes powerful women 'cause he's so secure in his masculinity or whatever. Two siblings run a major company, the brains behind the operation of couse, a woman. The parents of the two siblings died, yes, you've got the hang of it now, because the father was an idiot and didn't listen to his wife. The super intelligent villain, is that same woman. These are just some of the things I remember, but one of the scenes that really bothered me was a really short clip of a TV ad where a guy was baking a cake or something and the narrator said ""so simple even HE can do it"", imagine this scene but with a woman trying to fix a computer and the narrator saying it's so simple even SHE can do it, many people would be very upset.I thought the first movie was pretty equal, each member of the family was equally valuable, they all realised they needed each other. While the super intelligent superhero might have been a guy, the super intelligent superhero suit designer Edna is a woman. It all seemed pretty well balanced. I'm just shocked the judge at the end wasn't a black woman as well to be honest.I'm all up for having women with the more significant roles in a movie but this is just an overload to the point where it's blatantly obvious they're trying to brainwash us through a screen, which reminds me a lot of the villain of the movie, peculiar... The message I took away from this is that we're best off just getting rid of men because women are perfect. I guess that's what equality means now a days.","2/10"

There is a sense of danger, anticipation and then delivery of that promise, against a very believable villain, and with none of the weird generic formula that plagues recent films like ""A Force Awakens"" and ""Star Trek Discovery"" which really gets in the way of telling a good story. I don't know what it is, but those aforementioned films feel the same and I can't tell them apart and always feel like I watched an alternate universe rerun of the same thing.

Of course women have to take center stage. Which is ok but when its obviously a trend in society, it seems manufactured. The extra super heroes seemed kind of generic and one dimensional, they threw too many in there and their animation seemed sub par. Violet did some cool stuff with her force fields, but Dash seemed slower, Mr Incredible not as strong but Frozone seemed to have a little stronger ice. And the plot didn't really make sense. Seems like after 14 years it could have been better, like the Finding Nemo sequel.

And here's what I think.Obviously I liked the first one much more, but still, this is a really good sequel. It has moments that are exciting and completely hilarious. It's very joyful to see this characters again on the big screen, including Jack-Jack (I know you will love him). It has interesting confflicts and, I won't spoil you anything, but it's very funny to see Bob Parr's parental side.So, It may not be as epic as you'd expect it to be, but however, the excitement of the action sequences and the charm of all the characters keeps intact.

"Incredibles 2","JohnDeSando","12 June 2018","In Incredibles 2, how does writer/director Brad Bird make a family film that is adventure, thriller, and comedy? Well, he's had practice beginning with Iron Giant and Ratatouille and The Incredibles in between. With three distinct approaches to entertainment he has made a reputation of smart and fun and plain genius all over.Incredibles 2 is super family fun as the family picks up where they left off, specifically leaving a track meet and pursuing The Underminer (John Ratzenberger), who is digging under the city with a giant corkscrew. The importance of this successful sequence is that it's the first time for the family to work as a team in public.It's a regular family going through growing pains and a superhero family trying to reconcile its gifts with a society that the rules against them. That's right, super heroes have been outlawed because they're perceived as adding to the troubles. The answer lies in pursuing the law and changing it more than fighting a strange villain called The Screenslaver, who hypnotizes while you watch. Obviously, a subtheme of this multilayered allegory is the enslavement of the populace to it screens. Yet, Bird does not enslave the audience to theme, e.g., a race sequence in which Elastigirl, Helen Parr (voice of Holly Hunter), chases a hover train taken over to head to destruction is as furious a ride on a motorcycle as you have ever seen.Not all is heavy-duty: Baby Jack-Jack fights a raccoon, funny in himself, with baby showing hitherto unknown powers. The sequence is high humor using a baby as a rib-tickling comedian-hero. Add to this slapstick the light orchestration of composer Michael Giacchino and you have a sci-fi animation with soul.That's the irony of this inspired animation and real life--sometimes even the good has to fight to be recognized, or to be legitimized: ""You know it's crazy, right? To help my family, I gotta leave it. To fix the law, I gotta break it."" (Helen Parr) Incredibles 2 is primarily about bringing back heroes to the public fold and figuring out how to break the law in order to fix it.Furthermore, what's a super mom to do when duty calls and she must leave the family under the untrained care of dad, Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson). Bird doesn't make Bob a boob (although there are laughs at his expense), but rather has the rest of the family pitch in to help with major challenge, baby Jack-Jack with hitherto unknown super powers.Bird recognizes the need for dads to fit in the management of the house, for instance, as he tries to untangle a mess with daughter Violet's (Sarah Vowell) date, who discovers she's a superhero. He misses their date, and dad must do some intricate counseling of his head-strong daughter. Even for a superhero, that's a tough challenge.But the super heroism most prominent is that of Mom, as good an example of the best of #MeToo that allows a woman to be empowered publicly and fulfilled privately, with a little help from her family. One of the best films of the year and in the animation canon for all time.","10/10"

"Incredibles 2","dezriknightangel","22 June 2018","At first viewing the Incredibles 2 was on par (no pun intended) with most Marvel sequels: Not deep, but visually stunning and entertaining throughout most of the film.That said...First of all, the story is weak and forgettable. The family for which the movie gets its name is hardly relevant, with Dash and Violet having no impact on the plot (and Dash failing to receive even an attempt at a subplot). Mr. Incredible fails in everything he attempts in both heroic and domestic pursuits, and Elastigirl saves a few lives before falling for an obvious trap and being controlled by the villain.As the story comes to its climax, all of the heroes (including Frozone and both parents) have been enslaved by the villain and its up to Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack to save the day. Rather than showing how young people can be just as heroic as adults, a car gets to be the hero, with their sole contribution being accidental. The film then concludes with complete victory for the heroes and an utter lack of character development. Such plots as the Underminer, the technology to erase memories, the damage lawsuits, and the villains unused ability to enslave the entire human race were ignored and forgotten.This movie was little more than an excuse for Disney to push its increasingly heavy-handed political agenda into the minds of young people. Every scene is filled with cowardly men, evil entrepreneurs, and flat jokes. The movie explicitly states that it is villainous to unplug from technology and live your life and that vicarious living through screens is ideal and that protests and law breaking is the only way to change public policy.This is not intended or writtwn ironically. This is the film's actual moral message.I'll end with this: If you enjoy the most recent Star Wars movies where beloved characters are rendered irrelevant and progressive politics are the driving force of the story you might not mind this movie. Yet in the theater with me were a lot of children who weren't laughing and a lot of parents slowly realizing that Disney is no longer family entertainment.Disney is a propaganda mill ranting against the capitalist middle-class society that supports it, and I urge you to stop supporting the films they release until their focus returns to quality filmmaking.","5/10"

However, after waiting patiently for so long for a sequel, I was a little disappointed. In the first movie, both Elastigirl and Mr Incredible used their superpowers equally, along with their children, to make up a great super team. Here Elastigirl stole the superhero limelight, with an obvious political message. Mr Incredible was portrayed as petty as he struggled with the fact that Elastigirl was picked to be the superhero while he was a stay at home dad. Regarding his superhero powers, he was utterly useless in the beginning when fighting Mole Man and in the end when fighting Screen Slaver. He couldn't even rip through a few pipes in the ship to get to the boiler room. The family didn't really gel as a superhero team like in the first movie, where the sum was greater than its parts.","8/10"

""Incredibles 2"" takes advantage of the advances in computer animation since the first film came out, and the family's adventures look snappier and super-exciting, but it is the echoes of the original (including a dynamic new score by the returning Michael Giacchino) that hook us.

"Incredibles 2","ssnake_z","21 August 2019","INCREDIBLES 2
RATING: 3.2/5Honestly, this should have been called ""ELASTIGIRL: THE MOVIE"" because she's really the main star. The rest of the Incredibles family takes a back seat to her, so much so that you barely even get to see the family suit up, much less work together as a real team. Dash suffers the most out of the family in that regard. If you're looking for character development, it's not really here outside Mr. Incredible learning how to be a stay at home dad, and even that's questionable. Frozone gets more screen time, so he's not just the token Black guy this time around. The villain is pretty meh by the end of it, and if you give their evil plan more than a passing thought, it ends up being pretty dumb and pointless overall.This film is basically a time capsule, being that it takes place pretty much right after the first Incredibles movie. After 14 years, 3 Presidents, and 10 years of Marvel Studios superhero movies, Incredibles 2 needed to be way more than just a run of the mil sequel. This may have worked when they were at the top of the superhero mountain in 2004, but they've been lapped by so many other superhero movies now that this really doesn't cut it in 2018. Add to that the fact that they're still on the whole superheroes being illegal thing, which Captain America Civil War covered much, much better, and Incredibles 2 just ends up feeling outdated.The score is pretty fantastic though. It's loud, it's bombastic, very 60s James Bond but with a superhero flair to it. The voice acting is solid with Mr. Incredible being the MVP with all the range of emotions he has to go through. The animation is great, no surprise there from Pixar. The action is pretty fast paced and serviceable, but for some reason, i just wasn't impressed by it. I really don't know how many other ways Hollywood can shoot a runaway train scene. It also didn't help that the first fight just reminded me how much of a Fantastic Four ripoff The Incredibles are too. I chuckled twice during the whole film, but my theater laughed a lot, so the jokes were clearly working on some level.One of the other issues is that there are really no clear positive male figures in the film. Mr. Incredible is relegated to a stay at home dad, and he can't even figure that out on his own. Mrs. Incredible though, she can apparently do it all. In fact, almost every female in this film is infallible, while almost every male has some character flaw or has messed something up somehow. It's really weird. Like, the movie props up the women at the expense of the men, which i think sends a bad message.If you're looking for a few laughs, action, and to go back to 2004, you'll probably have a great time with Incredibles 2. If you're looking for a good story, good villain, balanced positive male and female figures, and a superhero team that actually practices teamwork, then you should probably look elsewhere. Outside the animation, music and jokes, the movie fails on almost every other front and that's just unacceptable after 14 years. Beware the hype with this movie, cause it simply does not live up to the first Incredibles, at least not for me, not by a long shot.","5/10"
"Incredibles 2","neonadventure","16 June 2019","Summary: The film is takes place right after the first one did. They fight against the Underminer, which they did already with Mr. Incredible and Frozone in ""The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer"" (2005). But they change the ending of that game just to continue on obviously which is good because the game only has Mr. Incredible and Frozone to play as and NOTHING ELSE. Then they get in trouble for destroying a Government building and then they have to live in a motel after the aftermaths of the Underminer attacks. (kaboom) Eventually, Frozone comes and talks to Bob and Helen Parr about a guy who wants to help all three of them bring back supers into justice again.Thoughts: I was happy at first, and now I wish that the third will be stronger than this stale piece of bread. Oh sorry, did I offend you, well everyone has opinions too you know. (I didn't offend you right?) Why do I think this movie is bad, well because the movie has a bad storytelling. In a way it's like you see an intense crime fighting scene, and then you see some father having an emotional breakdown over his new math book. Well that's not the point actually, the point was that there are no major plot twists that ever shock you, you just know that, ""Ok, something doesn't feel right and then that lady who doesn't sleep just puts a mask over her head and she's like 'I'm so sorry little one.'"" And I kind of felt like this was a little weak since most of the stuff that goes in the movie kind of copies off of the other film. I really thought having that ending was just bad.Seriously, this film isn't that great as I expected. There are a few mistakes that I have noticed throughout the film and the story isn't powerful and there isn't anything new to explore. (Hey guys look at my basement, it's empty.)Although Incredibles 2 does have positive ratings from many critics, it is one of the most disappointing films for me this year when it comes to movies that came out in 2018. (NINJAGO MOVIE) The 1st film is where the Parr family deal with mediocrity as the main theme of both of the films. Well Incredibles 2 is the just a synonym for mediocrity.My dark predictions will ruin your day. There might not even be a INCREDIBLES 3 movie unless if they have a plot twist. (But it's going to be useless to add in a plot twist.) This movie is where Brad Bird is like, ""You've watched the 2nd, i'm finished.""","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","fernandoschiavi","20 May 2021","The film begins by inserting us again in that universe, where heroes are prohibited, and begins the story at the very moment when the first film ended. From now on, we can witness the appreciation of the visual of the work, which manages to capture what was already very good and make it even better. Without forgetting the somewhat caricature physical characteristics of each character, the focus was applied to improving, mainly, the textures of the objects. From the clothes, to the background, everything is very alive, making us immerse ourselves even more in history. Also noteworthy for Violet's force fields, both in terms of looks, as well as in the new skills that the young heroine developed (apparently out of nowhere).Although a passage of time was possible, similar to what happened behind the scenes, redefining all the relationships between the members of the family nucleus and, therefore, turning the dynamics existing in the sixteenth century scenario of the film, Brad Bird chooses to play in insurance, but does not make use of this facility by negligence, using it as a possibility to renew and embody the themes related to the item that really matters: the family. And this is where the work surprises us with the choice of the Elastic Woman to take on the task of returning to work, giving her the protagonist that in The Incredibles belonged to her husband - who, in turn, takes on the task of taking care of the house and children. In this sense, Bird's idea of using an endangered train as the heroine's debut mission is perfect, since a similar rescue had been part of Mr. Incredible presentation in the previous feature. At the same time, the script recognizes how women who preserve their careers after maternity end up being charged for it, having to go out of their way to avoid judgments - which results in a brief and perfect joke that brings the Elastic Woman to the phone having to help the son to find a pair of shoes while trying to save the lives of dozens of people. Yes, the film takes place in a fictional analogue from the 1960s and Brad Bird explores this, putting a pinch of the discussion of the roles of men and women in the society of the time, but nothing of the level of today.Role reversal proves to be very effective in bringing a new look to history. While Bob goes out of his way to take care of everything and prove that she is capable, Helen experiences, for the first time, what it is like to be in the center of the spotlight and escape from the family routine. This parallel is the highlight of the film, as it works very well the relationship between these duties - Edna herself questions what can be more heroic than being a father -, giving enough time for both to shine. While the Elastic Woman is stretching around the city in various action and chase scenes, saving the day, the most fun core brings Mr. Incredible needing to use all his flexibility when dealing with Violet, disillusioned after the memory of his crush been erased; with Dash, more agitated than ever; and Jack-Jack, who is increasingly developing his powers. In fact, all the scenes involving the baby Parr are very funny. As seen in The Incredibles, the super-baby has several powers (he is basically Franklin Richards, from the Fantastic Four; in fact, the parody with Marvel's first family is blatant, the Paar are as dysfunctional as), it controls none and causes numerous confusions, whether by fighting with a raccoon, giving Edna Mode a hard time, or trying to help the family save the day. The little one steals the film for himself every time he appears.And the most admirable thing is that, in addition to all these virtues and its competence as entertainment, The Incredibles 2 still finds space to include important discussions in its narrative, criticizing the way the media shapes public opinion to demonize or deify someone and refuting , almost nominally, any approach to Ayn Rand's sociopathic texts (something that, by the way, has become a point of honor for Brad Bird since some critics suggested that the writer / philosopher had influenced the original). Of course, at certain times the filmmaker only shoots certain topics in the film without worrying about expanding them, as in Violet's fleeting comment about how the rich are never really punished or even when bringing the villain Hypnotist talking about how we are prisoners of screens that surround us. In contrast, Bird is courageous in pointing out how civil disobedience is almost an obligation in the face of absurd laws and attitudes on the part of the powerful, and it is equally relevant to realize how the protagonist of female characters is instrumental in serving as proof and example of capacity and need for women to occupy more and more leadership spaces, since not only does the Elastic Woman manifest having been influenced by the Ambassador (Rossellini) but she also influences the young Voyd.Another noteworthy point in The Incredibles 2 is, of course, its production design, which uses the 1960s as a starting point for the overall look of the narrative and brushes it with futuristic elements - since the train opened by the mayor to the Woman-Elastic motorcycle. As if that were not enough, the animators add fascinating mannerisms to the design of the characters and that help to convey their feelings more efficiently: notice, for example, how Violet compresses her lips in defiance when throwing something at the shredder or the accomplice look that changes with the mother in the face of the immaturity of the men in the family. Similarly, notice how Dash's hair takes on a darker color when wet or how Mr. Incredible seems to burn when removing the waffle from the toaster and you'll see why Pixar remains the undisputed leader in its industry. The soundtrack, in charge of master Michael Giacchino again, is perfect, grand in the moments of action and subtle in the milder scenes. It is difficult to deny the energy given to the work by the composer's score, which once again creates themes with a clear influence of jazz to suggest the individuality of those characters and the charm of their world.Likewise, Bird and Pixar's team of animators devise dynamic action sequences that explore the limitless possibilities of digital when it comes to camera positions and movements, surprising the viewer both in grandiose passages (like the one that occupies most of the third act) and in others of a smaller scale (such as the fantastic confrontation between a character and a raccoon). In addition, the design of the occupants of that universe is a gift in its own right, illustrating Pixar's care for every detail - from Mr. Incredible dark circles and stubble to Winston's frowns and facial tics, which clearly refer to those of Bob Odenkirk, responsible for his voice (incidentally, one of the most entertaining details of the film resides in the character Voyd, who, despite having the voice of Sophia Bush, is wide-open a digital version of Kristen Stewart, reproducing his way of biting his lips, tilt your head, move your hair and move your eyes as you speak).Although it is not carried out so deeply in either film, the reflection is explicit that a relationship cannot be sustained if each one does only what he thinks is right or only what pleases him. So much so that - as expected - only the union of the whole family (and friends) is able to solve the problem they face. Perhaps there is the biggest problem of the sequence, because it bets on a predictable plot, both in the climax and in the outcome, but which is held in the charisma of the characters and in the efficient action scenes.However funny they may be, however, the scenes involving the Incredible Baby still sound like a narrative crutch to support the main uninspired premise, which displays several hasty resolutions, as well as the underutilization of beloved characters - the case of stylist Edna Mode, limited to a kind of special participation (fun, but short) - in addition to a very predictable turnaround, which moves the final act. And if in the technical sphere the years that separate The Incredibles 2 from its predecessor were beneficial, in terms of the market they may not have had the same effect, since the saturation of the superhero genre (including several examples based on the comic appeal) ends up taking away part of the freshness offered by the original. Taking into account the expectation created due to the waiting time, and Pixar's own history, this feeling of repetition of a formula, but lacking the ingredient of innovation, the studio's brand, is almost inevitable - as had already happened with Finding Dory (2016). Still, the combination of a visually elaborate animation, good jokes and, above all, the empathy previously established by the characters, guarantees pleasant escapist entertainment for audiences of all ages.Brad Bird knew how to measure perfectly how much to bring from the first film to reactivate the memories of fans of the work. Some speeches and gestures may even go unnoticed by the least attentive, but certainly the situations involving Edna and Lucius with his wife, will bring the nostalgic and fun feeling that was expected. Released no less than 14 years after the first film, The Incredibles 2 is one of those sequels that respect the original without feeling the obligation to basically repeat it - and, thus, I will be happy if the series comes to win new chapters, even if these take another many years. After all, one of the many advantages of animations is that your characters never need to grow old.","3/10"
"Incredibles 2","kressckerl","21 October 2018","I am gonna try not to spoil too much, at least here in the start. I think this movie had a lot more potential than was included in the package. The plot was predictable, no emotion in the villain like the prequel, and the characters were bland and boring. But it wasn't all that bad, it scored a solid 8 from me after all, I liked the part with the stay-at-home dad, though it was really funny. And the action scenes were cool and entertaining.Spoiler past this point -------------(I am bad at separating spoiler-content from non-spoiler content)As said above, the villain is super bland and extremely predictable, and as soon as the siblings invited the Super' characters, I knew something fishy was going on, thus I already had the siblings as prime suspects in my villain investigation. When Helen captures ""The Screenslaver"", I was honestly not sure if it was meant to try to fool the viewers into thinking it actually was The Screenslaver, but I thought it was dumb how Helen didn't stop to think for a second that, that could have been the case.Even tho I didn't like the plot nor the villain I still found the movie entertaining, at first when I exited the cinema I could not decide wheater the first movie or this one was best, but I can now.","7/10"
"Incredibles 2","SoumikBanerjee1996","2 July 2023","I don't know about the others, but I personally found this sequel considerably better than the original. The story shrewdly incorporated some societal issues as well as eloquently showcased the rapport between the members of the family in a more elaborated fashion and therefore paving the way for some exciting character dynamics and development.Albeit, the lack of a compelling antagonist comes back to haunt them yet again. While the events that gradually unfold made for a ride full of intrigue and thrill, lesser emphasis on the overarching storyline influenced the outcome even to a certain extent. It couldn't acquire the point of gratification it should have otherwise.","1/10"
"Incredibles 2","geno-young","26 March 2020","Seriously? I waited 16 years (I just saw it for the first time today) for this? The ONLY reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because of the animation, humor, charm and fast-paced story telling. That's it. This was nothing more than another preachy, far-left piece of feminist propaganda that fits into the virtue signaling politically correct culture that has a strangle-hold on our media and society right now. I'm all for equality, but when you shamelessly pander to a specific group of people (women) and emasculate the other group (men) just to further the social standing of the group that you feel has been marginalized (women), you totally defeat the purpose of your mission. If equality is what you are seeking, let the marginalized party gain that respect on their own merit. I believe that it does women a great disservice for these movie studios and the media to thrust them into the spotlight for the sole purpose of making them look superior. That in itself defeats the purpose. Enough with the virtue signaling from Hollywood, let women be strong side by side with men, for THAT is equality. One can not be better than the other. This movie clearly pushes an agenda, and makes men out to be mindless, bumbling buffoons while the women run the world and are the masterminds behind it all. The only male with a SHRED of common sense is Dash and THAT'S REALLY saying something! The whole premise, in fact, is that Mr. Incredible is so bumbling and heavy-handed, that Elastigirl has to hold up the torch while he stays at home with the kids; leading to disastrous results . You get it? Classic feminist role reversal.Make no mistake whatsoever, this film was a deliberate cog in the master plan of blurring the lines between what it means to be male or female. Unless you've been living under a rock for the last 4 years, it's been blatantly obvious that there is a serious war against masculinity occurring in our society right now; and this film plays on that and is nothing more than propaganda advocating for it. The film rambles on with little substance or originally and ultimately leads to nowhere. There's no climactic build up, plot twist or shocking reveals. Just a disgruntled woman at the center of it all. And that's it. Pair that with Violet's bumbling obsession with Tony, and Mr. Incredible trying to learn ""New Math"" and you've got the whole film in a nutshell. I didn't wait darn near 20 years for this! The film is entertaining and the characters are likable, but the subliminal and often OBVIOUS messages and themes throughout make this film such a disappointment. The original appealed to EVERYONE, but this one clearly is geared towards a certain group. There are moments in the film when you don't know if you're watching ""The Incredibles"" or ""The Princess Diaries!"" Yes, the feminist undertones are just THAT loud and clear. I know in our current political climate EVERYONE is a 5¢ advocate/activist but this is just pathetic. You can't even escape in a CHILDREN'S movie! Get back to making classics Disney, and leave the politics to the experts. A disappointment.","9/10"

"Incredibles 2","hws72","30 June 2018","Wanted to like this. Wanted my kids to like it. Then we went to see it. Total let down. First big let down...Pixar characters using profanity. I hate it when projects geared for children use profanity. There was absolutely no reason for it. It actually felt like a slap in the face to parents. Second let down...making Mr. Incredible a complete idiot for 90% of the movie. I am ok with giving Elastigirl the spotlight since Mr. Incredible had his time in the first movie. I am ok with him being a stay at home dad. The fact that this movie depicts him as an idiot incapable of raising his own children, and pretty much a boob, was just a little too PC for me. Third...the intentional use and mention of alcohol by Elastigirl and the villain. I am not opposed to alcohol, but I have a hard time with it presented like an enticing advertisement in a kids film. The director went out of his way to add the profanity and use of alcohol to this film. Disney has become a huge let down for me.","9/10"

"Incredibles 2","mohammedalawami-10948","11 February 2021","Honestly, some of these reviews pain me. I guess a movie that has a female lead and villain is immediately a femenist movie and I guess if it's not as good as the original, it's a disappointment and an awful movie and looking at the hateful reviews, it seems to be people who waited 14 years for this movie that are hating it. Gosh, people these days are so hard to please.Going away from the annoying haters, this is one excellent Pixar sequel. It's not as perfect as the original but that movie is so perfect in every way it's hard to beat it and honestly, I think this movie beats the original in a couple of ways. Obviously, the animation is gorgeous and probably the best from a cinematic point of view. Brad Bird is a genius. Each scene has magnificent lightning and each surface and body part is polished so beauifullly. It truly is a work of art. That 14 year break really helpes the animation team to refine the animation.I also think Violet and Jack Jack are much better characters. Jack Jack steals the movie with so many funny moments and awesome sequences and it's awesome seeing a super baby, something that was teased at the end of the first film and it's expanded on brilliantly. Violet as well is much more likeable. More confident and more able to stand up to herself and ask a boy out. She's also another character that steals the movie with so many hilarious moments and goes through a great character arc, reconciling with Tony and becoming a responsible teen hero, putting the needs of her family and the world over herself.Bob as well is taken in the perfect direction. At the end of the first film, he apologizes to his family for being a lousy and selfish father and swores to do better and here, he takes the responsibility and I appreciate how this film takes it seriously and shows fatherhood is no easy task and as the film progresses, he tries and tries but constantly gets held back in one way or another but by the end, he becomes a suitable parent.Onto the main plot. This film definitely takes the story in a perfect direction, commencing with the Undermine fight and reinforces an issue in the first movie with superheroes being illegal and now they need to resolve that issue. A perfect concept for a sequel and leads to pretty adult dialogue scenes about people's perception on heroes and why they're seen like that. Elastigirl provides to be an amazing protagonist who is likeable and kicks ass in so many amazing sequences. Frankly, I don't get why people complain about her being the protagonist. Bob is the reason why superheroes became illegal in the first place so logic dictates Elastigirl should take the responsibility.The action scenes are so amazing in the movie and we get to see different heroes. Each action scene feels incredibly different and utilizes the character's powers perfectly whether you have the undermine fight, the motorcycle chase scene, the helicopter rescue scene, a battle on a cruise ship, a hosue battle and some hand-to-hand combat. They're fast-paced and beautifully animated.In terms of the villain, I actually kind of like Screenslaver. I really like her beliefs about superhoees as well as her ideology and you really get where she's coming from and I can't lie. Screenslaver is really intimidating and has great motivations.In terms of why this film is not a 10/10, I felt Dash got sidelined and didn't have much to do and didn't have any standout action scenes. I also felt like Evelyn's plan did not make much sense. I guess it plays out pretty coherently but it's overcomplicated. I felt like the final battle as well was a bit rushed and it just didn't feel as fresh or as mature as the first. There was something special about the Incredibles, focusing much more on the adults rather than the kids, making it feel more adult. This was more focused on the kids and a whole family, which is not an issue but a bit of a shame after the first movie. Regardless, Incredibles 2 is an incredible sequel to the first that doesn't deserve the hate.","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","patboldt","27 June 2018","Going into this movie I expected to see a film that just outright sucked. Too much time had passed, the voice actors had to change, the hype was going to be too great and there was no way it would please expectations which would be way too demanding. Then, when I heard this film was really good I thought that people might be overreacting and just saying it's great when really it wasn't. This is how I thought, this is how I was trained to think. Well? They're damn right! This film was awesome! It was on par with the original! It was super! In an age of superhero movies you'd think that they wouldn't be able to get it right with a sequel for a movie that came out 14 years ago.Yet they did, Brad Bird scored again! The key to this film's success is the pacing and flow. The movie feels very upbeat with energetic action and an engaging story. It has some quiet moments for storytelling but it never feels like the story comes to a halt. There is also plenty of humor but unlike say the Marvel movies it feels natural and doesn't come from dumb one liners but instead from slapstick and funny writing and a few running gags. This helps the story maintain a fast beat and the audience is almost always invested. The only real downside is that the villain is not nearly as good as the villain in the first movie. I don't wanna get into spoiler territory but it isn't as memorable or as entertaining as Syndrome (the first villain in these films). Once you watch it you'll see why. With that said, this is more than made up for with the family dynamic. This film continues the great family that we got a taste of in the first movie and devokes so much time into it. The only detracting flaw from the first movie that kinda pulls people away is the fact that a lot of the movie (at least in the beginning) deals with Mr. Incredibles mid-life crisis and not the family dynamic. But this wasn't a problem since this allowed him to be the main character and thus we feel a closer connection to him than we would with Elastigirl. Well, now it's full circle. Even if the first film has the better villain, this film gets the better family so it's pretty even. Holly Hunter, how do I say it, damn well killed it. She is so good in this movie! I had my doubts and I kinda expected her character to be a step backwards but she felt really natural. The perfect family dynamic from the first movie is preserved and even expanded on and Elastigirl is no exception. Also really liked Mr. Incredible who was my second favorite character from the last movie (Syndrome was number one). He goes through a pretty convincing arc and he is still a great father character, something that had become rare in animation today. The kids are great too, including Jack Jack who is hilarious as ever, and though Dash has a different voice actor (which I know is unavoidable) I am very pleased that it sounds so similar to the original and my suspension of disbelief was preserved. Go watch this movie, it's worth the wait and really fun to watch. If you loved the original you'll love this movie too. It's great. Super great. 9/10. Really fun to watch.","7/10"

And I haven't even seen the second one so what the hell am I writing a review about?! Well, my fan-boy 10 out of ten is actually for the trailer and the short that Pixar made by cutting it out of the original. Jack-Jack is just perfect, and hilarious; I love the delighted/amused look on his face when he discovers he has laser sight for the first time -lets hope the kid doesn't have allergies when he grows up or he'll be sneezing and blowing off people's heads off left and right every spring.
This review does deserve a ""no helpful"" rating since I'm really just saying they did Jack-Jack perfectly - whoever did the animation for his character deserves a big fat bonus for their work - I'm going to see the movie in a theater and will buy it from Amazon just to see him discover his powers - which are awesome by the way - and the music when he ignites is a perfect match also.
I'm sure this is going to be one of the rare ""Im going to see it 14 or 15 times"" movies - which is saying a lot because lately I haven't even been able to watch through the entire movie of the last few that I was looking forward to but they turned out horrible new release movies that have been released.

"Incredibles 2","val-26334","16 June 2018","The reviews on here must be paid for. Saw with a group of 4 adults (3 were women) and 5 kids. Only 1 of the adult women laughed out loud during the movie and she only laughs at really simple humor. None of the other adults laughed and none of the kids did either.
The original was great (8/10 or 9/10), this was not. Even asking the kids all said they knew who the surprise 'villain' was early in the movie.
Many animated movies have a depth to the movie that both adults and kids enjoy. This did not. It was very simple humor. The main humor had to do with the super powers of the baby and how hard it is to be the Dad left alone with the baby. Just wasn't funny unless you really like simple humor.
I did hear a 5 year old girl tell her mom she really liked it on the way out. I think that was the target market.","5/10"

Then this rich investor turns out to be the villain. They fall for it again almost immediately. The parallels continue on and on.How long are we going to let writers get away with just re-hashing the same story change a few bullet points, package it, and sell it to us as new. As with most here the only things I enjoyed were Jak-jak and new CGI. other than that I could use my money back.","6/10"

"Incredibles 2","admacgm","19 June 2018","SPOILER: I have occasionally been asked, ""What is your favourite movie?"" It is a question I find hard to answer but ""The Incredibles"" usually comes to mind.The first movie was brilliant on so many levels and all the characters had depth, even the minor ones like Mirage and Bob's boss. The tension between Bob and Helen felt real but was constrained in a way that was totally appropriate for a family movie. The humour was clever and tensions worked out in a thoroughly plausible way. The movie thoughtfully and often subtly explored family dynamics in a manner unprecedented in superhero movies or mainstream animated movies,In the first movie Bob and Helen were both strong, willful characters who learned from each other. They put effort into their marriage and were ultimately rewarded for it but it was portrayed realistically as a work in progressIn this movie, not.It was not brilliant on any level other that the technical. The animation was fantastic. Although I actually enjoyed the parts of the movie there was much I did not like.The characters lacked the depth of the first movie. Helen as others have pointed out was particularly shallow, ironic considering how aggressively feminist the plot was.The minor characters were like cardboard cutouts. The new superhero crew seemed to try to tick demographic boxes, although I am sure someone will rant there was none identifying as a woman of colour with a speaking part. (apart from Frozone's wife Honey)The tension between Bob and Helen was largely replaced by Bob's tension with the feminist world view. Bob's emasculation for most of the movie was nauseating to watch. While feminists may rejoice at the role reversal, I have met very few women who find underachieving, stay at home dads attractive.The villain was quite predictable and her story-line felt contrived.An over arching feminist agenda seemed to dominate the movie in a thoroughly skewed manner.Pro women:
1. the main superhero action was given to Helen. She is portrayed as nearly perfect and able to singlehandedly do almost anything.
2. the main superhero of the new group is Void
3. the main politician is the Ambassador
4. Violet gets a story arc but Dash gets very little. (Jack Jack does but babies are rather gender-less). Violet's superpowers save people several times
5. the technical wizards of the movie are both women and although Edna Mode is arguably transgender, she still identifies as a woman.
6. the evil genius is a woman but not that evil; almost as if to say women villains are so much nicer than male ones. She only tried to kill one person, where as Syndrome actually killed several. For a bonus feminist point she is quite possibly lesbian and therefore really does not need men at all.
7. Violet after much effort, angst and embarrassment finally gets her date with a nice guy, only to leave him standing at the ticket counter. The message is loud and clear, girls can do as they want, when they want and men should accept this without question. Anti men
1. Bob is portrayed as inept, reckless when doing the superhero thing and chauvinistic. Even when doing his superhero stuff, he never succeeds until one or more people are helping.
2. Dash has a relatively minor role and is often reckless and impulsive just like his dad. His most memorable achievement is stealing a car!
3. Rick Dicker a important male authority figure from the first movie, is portrayed as ineffectual and is put out to pasture.
4. Winston Deavor is arguably dangerously naive, implausibly altruistic and rather shallow.Finally the most ridiculous part of the whole movie. Jack Jack. It is a given that a certain suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy any superhero movie but usually there are rules to constrain the plot and make the story worth while and set up an internal coherence. Every Superman has his kryptonite and in another age every Achilles had his heel. In what universe is a baby with highly destructive, poorly controlled and nearly limitless superpowers a good idea? That Jack Jacks antics have such benign effects is implausible to say the least. However did the raccoon survive? By sheer political correctness I suspect. We can't have babies killing wild animals in a Disney movie. The internal realism of the first movie is thoroughly absent here.In summary it feels as if the original movie got a Neo-Marxist rewrite. There was enough spark left over from the original movie to make it watchable but not enough to redeem it.","4/10"

"Incredibles 2","stamp-587-149747","17 February 2019","This film reminded me of an old SNL skit--a skit from way back in ancient times, when SNL was actually funny. In the skit, Phil Hartman plays talk-show host Donahue, and he starts off an interview thusly: ""With us today is Dr. Norma Hoeffering, author of the book, Women Good, Men Bad..."". For me, that pretty much sums up the over-the-top PC level of Incredibles 2. Lots of other reviewers seem to have documented this aspect, so I won't add any more here.Beyond the PC overload, I also find it kind of annoying that they wasted Mr. Incredible on a never-ending Mr. Mom remake. That might have been funny for a few minutes, but it went on and on and on and on... And even once Mr. Incredible finally gets into the action, he doesn't really seem to have much to do.On the up side, the animation is fantastic (as always in a Pixar film), and the kids were pretty good. And, I liked Edna's scenes too.","5/10"
"Incredibles 2","JakeBrinkman","30 December 2018","First off, this movie needs a huge epilepsy disclaimer because there are several scenes that are very likely to give people problems.Though the movie was still very good, it didn't come close to matching the expectations set by the first movie. My biggest problem with this sequel was that the family did not seem to work as a team. In the first movie, the whole family was continually using their powers to complement each other. This movie had each Incredible acting largely on their own; all working towards the same cause, but usually not directly interacting with each other. This appears to be standard for modern superhero films, but the first Incredibles had lead me to expect more out of this sequel.","5/10"
"Incredibles 2","benraddon87","31 July 2018","I was mostly entertained by this. On YouTube there is a video which talks about this movie and the video was called the Rise of Feminism, I figured it was just someone trolling. Nope. 
Some of this movie was entertaining, 'some', but after watching it and thinking more about it, and looking at other reviews, I saw that it was right. Only if you're not paying attention at all, even when you're being bashed over the head with this would you not notice. 
The action was impressive, but Elastigirl feels like a Spider-man rip off, she pretty much just does what he would do, and men who are made to look useless and stomped on.
In a way I'm glad I have watched this so I can from my own opinion, but it's unlikely I'll be watching this again. I'm done with movies which force political agendas instead of just giving us qualify entertainment, that's why I've stopped bothering with the new Star Wars franchise, and I'm sticking with the classic originals. 
Anything else wrong with this movie has already been covered in other reviews.
One last thing for any ladies who are reading this to think about...if a movie was released with the deliberate underlying message that woman are idiots, would you watch it? I highly doubt it, chances are you would be deeply offended.","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","rowdybuschfan","20 June 2018","I have been a Disney/Pixar fan since Toy Story was released, Throughout the years they have made wonderful films but however have made decent films. The Incredibles for me falls under the decent category, I don't understand what was the big hype about this one and still don't to this day. Now look it's not bad but it wasn't my cup of tea. This sequel doesn't quite live up to the expectations of it's first film and honestly compared to the one 14 years ago they used the same formula that didn't quite mesh well this time around. Weak story, Villain very predictable and the action might be too intense for some viewers.I don't hate this film but again it just wasn't for me and I may not understand why everyone likes it so much...So take this review with a grain of salt","9/10"

It's too preachy to be escapist, but too uncommitted to be a feminist diatribe. There's none of the wonder, peril or heart of the original, and it adds nothing to it.It feels like a fading echo, drowning in a horrible over-blown score that's just one extended brassy blare.","2/10"
"Incredibles 2","willz187","26 February 2019","This movie is filled with too much anxiety. From the domestic yelling and arguing, to the temperamental baby, to the frenetic, sensory-assailing action sequences. I watch movies to get away from all this, to have fun. Intense action doesn't always equal fun, when there's so much going on you can't follow. Too much tension between characters and none of them come off well. The story itself has been done to death and was already covered in the first Incredibles. Difficult to appreciate the beauty of the animation with all this going on.","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","JWick23","19 March 2021","Not as good as the original but had a similiar atmosphere/vibe to it though but had some subtle differences.A solid story with positive messages but feels a bit too similar to the original with the centre idea being around the legalizaiton of superhereoes. In the last movie it was Mr. Incredible that try to fix that law but in this movie it was Elastigirl. The characters were alright, the Incredible family has been developing nicely but Jack-Jack seemed way to OP. The antagonist was just straight up lame, no super powers and her motives and personality seemed plain and stupid. The visuals have drastically improved since it has been 14 years since the last movie. The music was very good mainly with the use of trumpets.Overall a semi enjoyable film.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely..","10/10"

It seems the only thing Pixar forgot about in this movie is that it should be a kid flick....the plot, the setting, the music, the jokes and everything in this movie is too much for adults rather than for kids, lacking essential childish creativity and fun, which is a shame given that the first Incredibles was one of the funniest and witties of all of Pixars great movies.","7/10"

"Incredibles 2","kermitkid","31 March 2020","Although the plot is not as good as the first one, it is still worth the 14 year wait. The first half could have been improved immensely though, because for the first hour or so it feels like a gender-swapped rehash of the first one, and plays more like a direct-to-video sequel like the ones Disney used to put out. The first half still has its moments though, particularity the ones with Jack-Jack and the trouble he gets into. A lot of the humor in the first half does come from those scenes, and is more visual based. After the first hour, the plot definitely picks up and reaches a satisfying conclusion. There is still plenty of great action, and the villain, while not as good as Syndrome from the first movie, does deliver a pretty great monologue that makes you think for a moment that their goal isn't so bad, but simply the methods they are using to reach that goal. When it finally is revealed who the villain is though, it does feel stolen from a certain Marvel movie that shall remain unnamed so as to avoid spoilers. The animation is still gorgeous, (though the character of a newscaster does look like an animated caricature like the ones you would get drawn of yourself at a carnival and he just looks creepy), and some of the best voice acting is from Bob Odenkirk. He is one of the best characters in the film. It is disappointing that the film, in terms of plot and character development, had to take a bit of a step backward. What made the first film so unique was seeing the family dynamic and the family using their powers to help each other out. Here, we get very little of that. It has the typical ""The dad is stupid and hapless and needs the mom to fix all his mistakes, har dee har"" stuff that's done to death in just about every sitcom on tv, and that's disappointing, especially from a so-called ""family"" company like Disney. Haven't we as a society moved past this? In a world where everyone is crying for ""equal rights and representation"", shouldn't we get true equality? Equality does not mean superiority at the so-called ""privileged"" individual or party's expense,and that's disappointing to see here. It also had some unnecessary (albeit mild) profanity, which was also disappointing. (Again, ""family"" company) Overall, it is worth seeing. Just don't expect it to be as thrilling as the first one.

The characters are what we remembered them to be, the action was fun and the plot was entertaining. Adding more supers to the movie allowed for some unique fight scenes and new story arcs. The Screenslaver was a good villain who was menacing enough with good reasons for being evil. However I wish the Screenslaver would have done a little more during the action scenes but I'm fine with what they did. I also would have liked them to play with our emotions a bit more during the 3rd act. The music was as good as the original and the ending was really satisfying.","5/10"

"Incredibles 2","Blazehgehg","19 April 2019","There's honestly nothing really wrong with The Incredibles 2. If all you're looking for is a solid family movie, it's enjoyable enough, with lots of action and fun characters.But I can't shake the feeling that there's something about it that's... ""off"" feeling. It took Pixar fourteen years to make a sequel that is, by all accounts, a little more than average. The original Incredibles was a breath of fresh air, and the best super hero movie in its time. It broke new ground for Pixar in every aspect.This just feels like the next episode of a television series. Everyone is kind of settling in to a status quo and the adventures continue. I know it's a weird complaint for a movie that's not actually bad.Part of that, I think, has to do with the film's themes. The first Incredibles had the villain Syndrome, who defined the whole movie's attitude toward super heroes. It touched on how fans interact with their idols, the reality of being a ""super"", and the very real reasons people may resent them for their enhanced abilities. Those elements anchored everything in something more thoughtful than just punching out the bad guys in a secret volcano lair.The Incredibles 2 lacks that anchor. It hamfistedly gestures towards the topics of media consumption and gender equality, but ultimately chooses to say nothing about either issue. Instead, it fills most of the movie with very standard superhero antics punctuated by smaller slices of family dynamic. It's all still fun... but they just aren't as deeply rooted as the themes of that first movie.Again, it's just The Incredibles, but more of it. And unlike some movie sequels that feel like they're trying to replicate the formula of the first movie, Incredibles 2 stands out as its own thing. It just doesn't breach any new subjects. Instead, it comfortably rests in the shadow of the original.For most people, that's good enough. But I was hoping for something a little more incredible.","1/10"
"Incredibles 2","thesterlingweaver","25 March 2022","One of the few things that has improved is the animation, it's gorgeous, the villian is kind of a mixed bag, but the comedy is there, but this movie seems just more like elastic girls movie instead of Mr Incredibles movie, which is fine but Mr incredible kinda gets pushed to the side this time around to act like a normal father would, but the biggest problem with this movie was the fact that it took 14 YEARS TO MAKE THIS LONG AWAITED SEQUEL, but still takes place right after where the original ended, if this was made maybe 3 or 4 years after the original, this wouldn't be a problem, BUT 14? That's way too late. So this is great but not near as good as the original Incredibles which is... Well.. INCREDIBLE.","1/10"
"Incredibles 2","Ashishsinghal97","26 June 2018","Went in with moderate expectations, came out thoroughly disappointed. Fell well short to the now classic predecessor. The Man gets to do the woman job. He sucks at it first ( of course) but makes everything right by the end. Woman gets the man's job. She is just perfecto. Nothing can be wrong in the hands of a woman. The film relies way too heavily on the baby got powers comedy. It works for a time before getting tiring near the end. There is a major twist too which not a twist but an insult to the basic IQ of today's moviegoers. That happens when a movie with few characters tries to build a mystery around the main villain. Nothing special, no surprises. Just nothing. Highly predictable movie. Only good part is the two big goose bumping action scenes (The Underminer's and the metro rail one). Minus them and the movie is a giant turd in everything. The hype is fake this time around. Can't believe how critics just give free passage to such movies in the name of entertainment. They do more harm then do good by doing so.","3/10"

now seeing the whole family back at it again trying to stop the underminer only for some strange reason they let him escape I mean thats not a bad thing but they could have surly saved the town from destruction but then again there wouldn't be a story for this movie if they hadafter they get back to the hotel nothing really happens for about 20 mins or except for them moping and arguing and then after that we get a few minutes of suspense and some action i would say totally not even 25 min 
the stay at home dad thing was kinda funny but mostly kinda boring
Jack jack was the whole show he was the only reason i stayed watching it because of his humor and sillinessThe villain in the film i noticed who it was right away and she really doesn't do much or then again you never see it since they don't show it
all you see is a flashing screen hypnotizing people
unlike Syndrome who in my opinion was a great villain really shows off how much of a bad ass he is but screen slayer is so boring it makes dr evil look like a genuiseand non of the family except elastic girl suit up until the last 20 minutes of the film you don't even get to see frozone in this he has so little time this film could have done without him
oh and when they say jack jack has 17 powers i didn't see 17 i saw mybe 8 but may have missed some
another thing how didn't the parents remember jacks powers when he used them on Syndrome in less they suffered amnesia 
an one more thing they should have done was shown more of the kids powers like how they have adjusted to them is there anything new to them but instead its the same oh same oh this has a few laughs some decent special effects but not enough action of the combination in 14 years they could have perfected there art but instead were lazy and didn't put enough effort into what made the first one so great

"Incredibles 2","SAMTHEBESTEST","22 June 2018","THE INCREDIBLES 2 REVIEW :
'Pixar does it again'... Whenever i see Pixar films this sentence has always made it to appear in my review/mind. Long wait of 14 years, so much anticipation finally comes to end with a Worthy sequel to The Incredibles. The Incredibles does entertain you throughout and on a high note tells some family values lessons as well. Comedy, humour, thrills everything is just perfect and so does the film.Story is about Superheroes are not legal, they should not use their powers which causes the destruction so they gotta stay at home like common people. Then how they survive from a conspiracy in a heroic style which better be seen in theater. We know 4 superhero characters in previous films and the addition of new cute little superhero is surprisingly amazing. Background music for the same is very effective and accurate as far as that particular scene is concerned. Cinematography is Excellent, especially in action scenes those moving camera angles will blow your mind. Visual effects are eye pleasing. Director has done a mind blowing job by keeping this excellent written product entertaining and engaged from the first frame to the last.Overall, The Incredibles 2 a Must See for Pixar Lovers, at some moments it looks even better than it's prequel. On a funny note i say, Marvel should take lessons from Pixar on how to make a Terrific Superhero film barring regular money making stuff. I never thought The Incredibles will have a Sequel and after watching The Incredibles 2 i want more and more sequels in this franchise. With a grin smile on my face, i rate it 7/10*","8/10"
"Incredibles 2","mullikine","29 June 2018","Incredibles 2 was such a disappointment, even for me. i loved the first one. i'd find 2 hours of elevator music more memorable. no way near as imaginative as the original. you can only take so much shock value comedy, like americas funniest home videos. the dramatic music is the modern day substitution for canned laughter and reminds me of the way old movies would double the playback speed to make james bond look like he could punch someone, do a barrel role and plant his ski poles in under 5 seconds -- the drama is cringy. the movie was predictable every time it gave you a moment to think. sometimes it felt like the characters are on the set of Tommy Wiseau's The Room, awkwardly making irrational decisions, such as Dash simply not removing eye masks. unlike how in the first movie every character appeared to use their powers to the best of their ability, this time they were only used when convenient to move the plot forward. this movie feels like a cargo cult version of the original, having been run past the engineers at the last minute, to make sure it is functional enough to prove the critics wrong. it's like the modern day equivalent of 100 roadrunner skits end to end. itchy and scratchy has more anticipation, transformers has more character development and shortland street has far more realistic drama. forced, contrived, unimaginative, predictible, just like everything disney makes these days.","6/10"
"Incredibles 2","amentagregory","8 June 2018","Great Movie! This movie seems to really improve on the original, with the same memorable characters such as Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Edna, with new break-out characters, notably Jack-Jack. Micheal Giacchino nailed the score, and like other Pixar/Disney films there are amazing visuals. However, the thrill and brain of this movie, differentiates itself from the traditional cookie-cutter PG animated films. So far, it has been highly rated by critics, and could be one of the biggest releases of 2018. I can't wait for Incredibles 3.","9/10"

Although it didn't have the originality of the original, it was a bet fun movie. It's apparent that the animation technology has drastically improved, and the movie once again shines when all the superheroes team up to use their powers together. I understand that this movie has elastigirl as the central character, but she's not as engaging of a main character on her own. Maybe next movie could feature the entire family a bit more.","4/10"

The animation is as great and the characters are engaging, as expected. The problem is that the story isn't as compelling as the original. It didn't feel like much was happening, honestly. Most of the family is doing normal stuff for most of the movie while Elastigirl and Jack Jack take center stage. The film doesn't take many risks and it suffers because of that. Clearly, there will be a third Incredibles movie but Pixar may have hurt future audiences' expectations by trying to not mess anything up with this sequel.","3/10"
"Incredibles 2","dee.reid","9 August 2019","I'll be quick and to-the-point. ""The Incredibles"" (2004) was simply the best and greatest animated film to come out in 2004. It was a love-labor to superhero lore, as well as a bold-faced SATIRE of superhero lore - done in animated form, by the one American animation studio to top them all off, Pixar. ""The Incredibles"" was a box office success and critical hit. So the question was, how could writer-director Brad Bird and his team of animators at Pixar follow it up?We got that answer with 2018's ""Incredibles 2."" While not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it grips you from its opening moments and holds your attention for the entire duration of its 118-minute running time. This sequel is bigger, bolder, and more family-centered than the first one; but don't let that fool you, there are still plenty of thunderous action sequences and moments of laugh-out-loud comedy and genuinely heartfelt family times to keep you interested.Do yourself a favor, and watch one of the most ""Incredible"" sequels ever made.9/10","6/10"

"Incredibles 2","LovelyAndJubbly","22 February 2020","--Skip to Section 4 for my final opinion--This movie, in my opinion, is just a cash grab banking in on the Incredibles' name. It's a bit like all the new Disney live action remakes, just there to make money off of our nostalgia. I watched this film in cinema when it came out, it was a waste of my money.The first film is a classic, an example of family entertainment done right. This film, however, pales in comparison to it's predecessor. Now I've been quite vague during this review, so SPOILER WARNING:1. Villain is terribly written.The villain in this film, Screenslaver (real name Evelyn Deavor), is TERRIBLE. Compared to Syndrome (the villain of Incredibles 1), who had a legitimate reason to hate superheroes and (more specifically) Mr. Incredible, it took me a while to figure out what the hell Screenslaver's motives were. A VILLAIN'S MOTIVES SHOULD BE CLEAR AND MAKE SENSE FOR THEIR SITUATION.Screenslaver's motives are that her father was killed by a robber and the superheroes, who had been OUTLAWED, couldn't save him. That makes NO SENSE, either her father was a complete moron or the writers couldn't think of an original motive.2. The plot is... bad.This film has one of the most predictable and terribly written plots I have seen in recent films and I've watched the Secret Life of Pets. It's just the hero's journey with a bit of a super twist.Unlike the first film, which had nuance, humour, action and emotion all in one film, I felt NOTHING whilst watching the sequel. A GOOD FILM MAKES YOU FEEL.3. The positives.The graphics are amazing, as expected from Disney-Pixar in 2018, and there was an hilarious sub-plot with Jack-Jack developing his powers, it had me and a lot of other people in my local cinema laughing.Do the positives outweigh the negatives? I don't think so.4. Final words.Just watch the first one, the second one is sub-par, barely entertaining enough for a baby film. Skip this film, watch the other Pixar classics.","5/10"
"Incredibles 2","dwpollar","16 June 2020","1st watched 8/12/2018 :
Action-based CGI entry from Pixar doesn't have much more than this, and therefore disappoints. In this sequel, the movie starts with ""Super Heroes"" being against the law, and the family trying to hang as ""just"" a family. A high-falooting business man has an idea to bring them back in the fold and hires the mom(because she destroys less stuff) to do some work to help turn the tides on the idea of bringing them back. Therefore dad has to do some of the normal mom stuff like taking care of a baby who has newfound powers. For some reason - Pixar added very little humor to this movie. The baby did some funny things, but that was about it. There was some unique animation(including one seen with the evil character) which could invoke seizures in some, but sorry that's not enough for a good movie. I have seen a lot of action scenes, and pretty much anything can be done in computer animation so it's ho-hum if there is not a story you want to follow and characters you care about. This had neither. A lot of time and effort was put into creating this sequel, but in my eyes it wasn't worth it.","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","achmoye","26 October 2018","What happened ?The first volet was nice and complex, pleasing both adults and children and this is just an explosion of bright color to please families who bring their kids.
Basically this movie is for kids.
All characters are void, every scene is a Superhero fight and it's messy and annoying. Gimme a break from casting superpowers. The very first scene is a crazy attack by a supervilain and every else follows as a fast-paced nonsense.
There is no breaks, transitions, just an endless flow of CGI like Disney knows how to do now. I guess the magic from 2D Disney movies is just dead.Another problem : they casted the guy from Better Call Saul to play...some kind of lawyer. They basically extracted this character from Breaking Bad and put him, and his voice, in the movie. This is what you do when you have no ideas about character design and character develpment.I don't buy that the sister fights crime at the end and leaves her boyfriend alone like an old sock, and does the most moral, responsible choice. Like hell she does, at her teenager age.Characters just show off their abilities without any interesting plot or development. This movie is an incredible failure. As always, the more money in involved, the more likely you are to fall into a huge pile of CGI epileptic mess.Goodbye, Disney. I'm gonna watch Mulan now.","3/10"

"Incredibles 2","shadow_blade-89459","14 March 2019","""Incredibles 2"" (2018) is a professionally animated action adventure comedy that carries the loveable fun from ""The Incredibles"" (2004). In this sequel, the family is charged with changing the concept of ""supers"" through recorded hero actions with Helen, Elastigirl,"" voiced by Holly Hunter, taking the lead. I loved the role reversal with Helen being the desired hero to take the lead, but I think the added screen time for Jack Jack, voiced by Eli Fucile, was the biggest family favorite. Everything Jack Jack did in this film produced hysterical laughter in my family. I am usually very skeptical of sequels, but this film is just as good as the first one with exception to some heavy foreshadowing.Brad Bird continues his reputation with character connections to the audience. Every character is identifiable in my own family and I just love that. The story is great, but anticipated, which makes the foreshadowing so difficult to avoid. To keep from spoiling the film, I would say the best way to have adjusted the undesired, would have been to make the bad guy a little less sketchy. This way it is a little less obvious that the bad guy is essentially broadcasted from the beginning. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and recommend a view if you enjoyed the first one, but once you have deciphered the ""evil one,"" keep it to yourself until the end and just enjoy the film.","3/10"

The film also felt disjointed and they turned the kids into brats that contributed nothing. The ending didn't make any sense either. Why were the people cheering for the supers when the last broadcast they saw was the supers saying they were going to destroy them. The citizens didn't know that the supers were being controlled so their cheering made no sense... Sadly this is the first Pixar movie that I really disliked.","5/10"

"Incredibles 2","spete-42141","7 July 2018","My personal opinion is that the drinking and cursing was totally unnecessary. One of the reasons I enjoy going to the theater with my family for a Pixar movie is because I feel that they are clean and I don't have to worry about what they contain. This one really surprised me with all the drinking and curse words. Having to explain afterwards to my 4 year old that we don't say those things is pretty embarrassing. Next time I will be looking up Parent Reviews before paying to watch it in the theater. The kids did enjoy all the parts with Jack Jack, and the teenage hormones were quite humorous. Unfortunately it left a bad taste in my mouth with the add garbage and I won't own this one.","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","alexissebastian","17 June 2018","Funny and fast paced: granted. Should that be enough? My two main concerns;1) Everything feel forced: by example, the character of Edna is brought back with no real justification (the choice to babysit Jack-Jack, really?). You may cut her scenes and the plot remains the same. She is not here because the story needs her; this is the usual ""making by the numbers"" that defines Disney these days.2) The motivation of the villain is extremely weak. (Spoiler ahead) She is upset because her father believed in superheroes and he lost his life during a home invasion. Sorry, but it sounds that she must consume her energies for revenge against petty criminals, instead of superheroes (Imagine somebody close is killed during an assault but police arrive late... Will you decide to convert into a vigilante against police officers or against criminals?). Once again, this feel extremely forced.I know that the majority of moviegoers just want the thrills and easy laughs (thanks, Jack-Jack) and put character motivations and plot in second plane. If that is your case, you will have a great time indeed.","8/10"

There was a wonderful segment at the very beginning of the movie where some of the voice actors and the director came out and essentially said- we know it's been a long time guys but we promise it will be worth it. And boy was it. Picking up where the first movie left off, superheros are still not in favor with society.

"Incredibles 2","dp-17275","28 February 2019","An excellent Pixar film, and a great sequel to the Incredibles. While it doesn't surpass the original, it is right beside it. Somehow after so many years this movie continues the same story-line and even small subplots from the original and manages to have the same tone and feeling. The animation improvement and higher budget is well utilized and noticeable. This film has heart thanks to Brad Bird's excellent writing and directing. The villain is standard but the best aspect of the film is when the family just behaves like a family. The voice actors are great as it does feel like a direct continuation of the original, Dash is the only character with a voice actor change, and you wouldn't even notice. The score is excellent by Michael Giacchino. This movie is great and I could not recommend it more.","4/10"

"Incredibles 2","MovieManChuck","26 August 2018","3.5/4After 14 years, the highly anticipated ""Incredibles 2"" waltzes into theatres. Based on the trailer, and the fact that Pixar has (in recent years) started to become more hit-or-miss with their efforts, I had very low expectations set for this movie. Of course, I watch it opening night, and while it doesn't quite match the first one, it's still a great movie.Incredibles 2 picks up right where it's predecessor left off, at the track meet with The Underminer making his debut. It's general theme is concerning the Parr family's attempt to bring supers back into legality and legitimacy. This movie takes a shift in its primary focus and puts the spotlight on Elastagirl, as she takes her turn in saving the day.The Parrs were perfected upon, and the action was one tough act to follow. Some of the powers really make for some great sequences. The kinky romance between Violet and Tony was fun to view, and Jack Jack was incontrovertibly awesome. On the flip side of things, some of the ""new heroes"" introduced were simply downright annoying to me, and the villain was predictable (and maybe a bit ineffective if you ask me). However, a few unlikable characters aren't going to kill the fun.While this movie didn't quite resonate with me in the way the original did, the original set some pretty mean standards. The Incredibles one of the greatest family movies ever made. Incredibles 2 is great as well, just don't go in expecting a repeat of the first one.","8/10"

It's a feat that Brad Bird is able to make scenes of mundane domestic life as entertaining as the crowd-pleasing action scenes.

"Incredibles 2","jre-5","3 January 2020","The Incredibles 1 is my favorite animated movie since the 1990s (when I was a kid), and the only one that I ever purchased. For a long time I was really looking forward to the sequel. But I was disappointed with it.The biggest problem is that too much time is spent with Helen doing all the hero work while Bob stays home doing nothing besides trying to take care of the kids. This isn't a bad story line, but it goes on for much too long. Bob eventually gets involved, but there's not a lot of times when he gets to use his super strength. There's not a lot of times when Dash gets to use his super speed either. I also thought it was annoying how rude Violet acts. I also didn't like it that Jack Jack has a whole bunch of powers and constantly causes problems. I can see why lots of people would like this, but I liked it much better when he wasn't around. Furthermore, his numerous powers make the lead characters seem a lot less special. The presence of numerous new super heroes further adds to this.It's not a bad movie, I did enjoy some of it, but it's just too unbalanced, I thought it felt sort of like a really long version of one of those minor sequels (like ""Jack Jack Attack"", ""Frozen Fever"" etc.). ""Incredibles 1"" had a lot more of a plot to it and was overall a much better movie.","10/10"

Incredibles 2 is the most corporate and boring film of the year so far. This film commits the worst offender of a sequel possible, not needing to exist. Nothing was gained, nothing important happened. All the characters are in the exact same spot from the beginning of the film to the end. There is no arc for anyone. The villain is one of the worst villains in cinema history. The plot is the most predictable and boring plot of recent years. There are some enjoyable things though. The action is fantastic, the humor mostly works, and some characters like Frozone and Violet are more interesting than others. Overall this is the safest thing Disney could have done with this film and it really shows. It's a shame because this could have been a fantastic film.","6/10"
"Incredibles 2","ThomasDrufke","21 June 2018","It took 14 years for an Incredibles sequel, and for some, that was far too long. I spend a good chunk of my time online reading articles and watching videos related to movies and television. I can't think of a single movie that people clamored more for than another Incredibles adventure. I like the first movie, but it would fall very far down the list of Pixar movies for me. So when they finally announced a sequel a few years ago, my reaction was pretty much nothing. Really, I just needed reassurance that if you're going to make a sequel 14 years after the original, there better be a darn good reason to do it. Well, after seeing the end result, I can't really think of a good reason why Pixar pulled the trigger on this one (other than the obvious - money). Is there anything overtly refreshing about Incredibles 2? Nope. It's predictable, unorginal, and uninspired. What I will say is that there are some very impressive action sequences and it was nice to see Elastigirl take center stage. Watching Jack Jack do his superhero-y things is also a joy to watch. However, the first film had a sharp script with just as much laughs as it did heart, and an obscure villain that somehow worked. I can't necessarily say the same about Incredibles 2, which falls into the trap of a rehashed script and a horrendously botched villain. Is the film entertaining and worth a glance? Perhaps, but if you're looking for something that improves on its predecessor, you should look elsewhere.6.8/10","3/10"

1. Animation and action scenes were amazing
2. The few times the family worked together to fight the bad guys.
3. Jack-JackCons(some, not all):
1. Before the movie started, why did they show the voice actors introducing the movie and ""telling"" us we'll love it? they are all old. That kinda messed me up since the movie continued in the parking lot after Dash's track meet where they were still young(2004). So my image of the parents and kids would still be those of where the first film left off. I love Holly Hunter, but their faces messed me up for like the first 30 min. but then i forgot about the intro.2. The villain(unknown to Helen) and Helen drinking alcohol when they got together. Just seemed strange for a kids movie and was like they were trying to tell us that women need to relax and drink too.3. Sequences with the kids: Bob being completely defeated caring for the kids. the kids disrespecting him all the time. I understand that is normal adolescent behavior, but why do they portray him as a total weakling.4. Forced diversity: the fricken green haired hero, i also saw a pink haired one, what was that big Brick ""they"" hero? The possessed bad guy heroes looked skinny and wimpy. And the old guy with vomit acid reflex powers? It wasn't funny.5. Probably shouldn't be a con by a guys standard, but Helen's curvy figure was distracting. it was like she was drawn to be super hot(with bigger boobs in some scenes) but still be a powerful mother..or something. Although hot, it didn't help the story.6. Weak villain. It wouldn't be a waste to see it at the movie theatre. just don't expect that you'll leave the theatre fulfilled like you did with the first movie.","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","Jisk","15 November 2019","Incredibles 2 is not a bad movie, per se, but it does not exactly take off the way the first one did. There was so much originality and genuine surprise in the first one and this one has little of that. The same great characters are there but the circumstances they have to face in this one are nowhere near as cool or interesting as in the first movie. There are a lot of nice moments here but they just don't add up to as compelling a narrative as we had in the first one. Which is too bad. They spend a lot of time and energy on the whole ""should supers be illegal or legal"" or not idea, and frankly I don't think the audience really cares too much about that. We've had X-Men movies and Watchmen traverse this exact same territory and the villain in this one is no Syndrome. So on the whole the film, especially if you are a fan of the first, is a bit of a letdown. There are some new supers here but they don't get much screen time. The most interesting ""new"" development is the discovery of jack jacks powers, which lead to the films most spontaneous moments. Which is too bad because Incredibles deserved better IMO.","10/10"

I do not know if brilliance can come out of a world where current political and societal trends are the norm, but the world of Incredibles wasn't that world, precisely why it was brilliant, and trying to make its world seem like, or rather be, something it isn't, and in my opinion shouldn't be, caused the sequel to be unnatural and banal. Hence, even though it was created with means that are light years away and ahead than that of its predecessor, it eats the dust of it in quality and memorability. Still, it deserves some appreciation, but merely because of the fact that it is the inheritor of a brilliant story and a brilliant world, perhaps long gone.","4/10"

"Incredibles 2","The-Last-Sith-Lord","5 August 2018","Since the first Toy Story, Pixar's movies always had amazed me, the originality, the story telling, the deep emotion that they were able to give to their characters, I remember myself crying on the end of Toy Story 3, Inside Out.. the good feelings that I had after watching Cars. But seems Pixar also joined the recently trend in Hollywood in making movies with political agendas and remove the budge of the creative and story telling department. 
The first Incredibles was great, very original, each character had it's place on the plot, you could see a family working together and the story felt super original. On this new one, it's more about ""strong female"" (they should make a movie of ""Strong Woman"" from South Park) and very predictable story (kind of story you can already know how it's going to end on the first 10min of the movie)It's a good movie to watch at home and just spend some time, when you don't have anything better to watch. It doesn't worth the ticket to watch on the theater. Hope Pixar can return to it good times and return to make good stories again without politics on it, as it seems they are really loosing their creativity upon political agenda since Cars 3. I love Pixar and I'm still looking forward for their future movies #MakePixarGreatAgain","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","Sam_Youno","2 July 2019","Thoroughly enjoyable, with (no surprise) astonishing animation, including a few sequences that manage to surpass the original. The increased focus on the Parr family's dynamics is handled with humour and restraint, and works far better than I'd feared. Jack-Jack is a complete delight, as of course is Edna Mode; and Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson manage to bring even more nuance to their characters---which were pretty damn good the first time round.But. . . . The plot, compared with Incredibles #1, seemed sprawling. Not ridiculously complex, but it lacked the original's laser intensity and clarity. Still, my main disappointment came early on, when we are told who the villain is, before any hint that there even IS a mastermind villain. We're introduced to Evelyn Deavor, and it takes about a quarter of a second to translate that into ""Evil Endeavor."" That reveals most of the subsequent plot, and the end of any suspense.I'll be watching the first ""Incredibles"" movie again, certainly, but not this one. And I hope there won't be a third.","8/10"

"Incredibles 2","valen060","26 June 2018","Things have changed greatly since the lighthearted 2004 Pixar hit The Incredibles. In this 2018 sequel, it feels more darker in content - like on the boundary line of PG to PG-13 - compared to its predecessor. See, unlike the original which played on the superhero genre of the early 2000s with sitcom-like humor, this feels like a blend of the current decade's juggernaut of ever-growing superhero movies with some maturity in these characters we've come to know those years ago.A few months have passed after Syndrome's defeat and the Parr Family have moved on with their lives as though nothing's happened. When a wealthy tycoon offers to bring Supers back into the spotlight, he asks Bob Parr's (aka Mr. Incredible) wife Helen (aka Elastigirl) to be the front in making it happen again, resulting in a new villain called the Screenslaver to wreak havoc.Compared to past Pixar films that spawned sequels (or a prequel) of their own, director Brad Bird did an impressive job by having these characters retain their sitcom-like quirks, but also including some character development that wasn't explored before. This is a sequel that was long overdue to be released years back and it was worth quite the wait (especially for the kids of 2004 who are now young adults in or out of college). The returning voice cast and the new cast members did splendidly well with their roles and the real scene-stealer has to go to both baby Jack-Jack and Edna. I wasn't bored in the least, it's a pretty good follow-up.","6/10"

That's not to say that the movies are all classics and I'd like reiterate that Incredibles 2 is no exception.This was an entertaining movie but nothing memorable. The story was interesting but nothing cutting edge. The humor was mild, nothing knee slapping. The only real distinguishing characteristic was the addition of several new ""supers"". Adding the new ""supers"" added some flavor and diversity with the action.Incredibles 2 was a nice follow up considering that many sequels are completely worthless.","9/10"

Meaning, not empty. I am amazed by new superpowers. Some locations, backgrounds, details look like real life and not cartoon. Reminds me of real life. Could be good as video game.

"Incredibles 2","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","28 May 2022","Made 14 years after and set 13 seconds later, this sees Supers still illegal. The rich Winston Deavor(Bob Odenkirk, great as the lifelong fanboy) and his sister Evelyn(Catherine Keener, spot on as always) offer the aid of their private company to reform the image and change the laws. Meanwhile, the sinister screenslaver has other plans.Some people are frustrated with how woke this is. And in their defense some of them do acknowledge that the first one did take steps in that direction already. I don't agree that it's a bad thing, but I will grant that it does make some choices that feel like they're worried people will think they don't go far enough. In general there are issues with this, due to the expectations of fans who have wanted something like this since childhood and now have kids of their own to take to it. Some things are recreated even though it doesn't make sense because of completed(here undone) character arcs, and while I wouldn't personally say that I felt there was too much ""funny baby"" stuff, it's true that it has nothing to do with the plot.There are at least a few too many themes going on, and I hate to say that because I agree with them. They should have killed their darlings. Some of them just get brought up briefly and aren't explored at all. They didn't expect to get to make another sequel so they had to put everything into this one. The action and visual storytelling are indeed incredible. It's significantly grander and from right away, which some say leads to it not being as impactful. I think they felt that they had to match the other superhero movies of 2018 - you know, like the long-awaited Infinity War. However, I do agree that it's overall more impactful in the original one. The use of powers is always logical and tactical. Great choreography.I recommend this to any fan of comic book inspired films. 8/10.","8/10"

"Incredibles 2","EmbraceTheGeek","19 June 2018","If you loved the first Incredibles then most of you were probably waiting patiently just like me. Now by no means is this sequel as good as the first but it is still well-done and very good for a sequel. I really enjoyed watching Bob take on the role of caring for the kids. The action sequences were very fast and entertaining beside the rapid flashing in the movie that might affect epileptic viewers. Anyway, this film is a lot of fun and it is also pretty humorous. There were a lot of times where a majority of the theater started chuckling and laughing so there was no absence of comedy. The villain arc was somewhat predictable but it still felt pretty satisfying and the story definitely had many interesting moments. The story flows well and should keep the whole family entertained.
Was this movie worth 14 years?
Yes, because if they did not take that much time it wouldn't have been as solid as this film is for a sequel. Just come into this film wanting to have fun watching it.
I loved the first and the second film is still very good. I definitely recommend you give the film a watch so you can form your own opinion and to enjoy a well made animated film.","9/10"

On the other hand, I am not a major fan of Pixar's films released prior to this one ( particularly Cars 2 and Finding Dory). So what do I think about this sequel? It is a flawed but interesting movie. Yes the movie takes plot points from the first film (to a noticeable degree), and the films villain character is entirely unmemorable. But the animation is impressive, the score is catchy, and it does build upon the first film is some good ways. Most certainly.","4/10"
"Incredibles 2","gijoe-48397","10 March 2023","The plot picks up for the most part where the original ends. The Parr family of superheroes is going after the Underminer, and Violet's secret identity is exposed to her crush. The sequence continues as the baby is handed off between characters who want to contribute to the fight and it's meant to be played for laughs, but I honestly could not see everyone in this family being that dense and such glory seekers as to pass this baby off during a battle and it ruined the immersion and believability given how intelligent the decisions made in the original generally were. During the battle, a mysterious man witnesses it and gets excited about supers returning. When it ends, the Parr family is arrested before ultimately being released and Rick Dicker wipes the mind of Violet's crush. Displaced from their house with no money despite Bob clearly acquiring hefty amounts of it from Syndrome jobs in the first movie, they plan to live out of a hotel until Frozone shows up about an opportunity. They decide to meet this mysterious man from the opening who explains he wants to get supers legalized again using Helen as the poster child, totally passing over Frozone for some unfathomable reason. Seriously, in every clip, Frozone seems less destructive than either Bob or Helen and he is just completely ignored. The plot then switches between every day life as a super for Bob and Helen's vigilantism in the city and it is tedious. The original Incredibles was slicker with this balance and moved on from it after the first act. And yes, it was humorous in a way, but also emotionally melancholy as well as relatable. This just seems to play simply to degrade Mr Incredible as an incompetent stay-at-home dad and head of the household. Then we come to Jack-Jack... I don't understand how nobody in the family could deduce in the original movie that he had powers between the odd babysitter phone call and their vision angle of Syndrome's jet when he turned into fire. It's simply bad writing so the rest of the plot can happen. And Jack-Jack is clearly pushed to the front simply as a merchandising product than an actual character. His powers are whatever the plot needs or whatever will elicits cheap laughs for shenanigans. Helen meanwhile is on the trail of a villain who hypnotizes others by using video screens and while parts of that feel like a more traditional superhero film, they are few and far between, with her time mostly spent talking to Evelyn about how awesome they are. After the Screenslaver villain is 'allegedly' caught, Helen deduces that he really wasn't who he seemed and that it was Evelyn all along. Seriously, one would have to be a character in this film to not have seen that coming the moment she was introduced, intended or not. This is where the plot begins to drag with Bob, Helen, and a conglomerate of other supers being hypnotized into Evelyn's minions so she can ruin the future of super's forever. It shifts over to Dash and Violet infiltrating the yacht where the super legalization is taking place on a global scale using a super cheap setup and payoff sequence. During this Yacht part, Violet and Dash have to fight other supers and in one particularly sinful instance, there is absolutely no excuse for them not to remove the hypno-googles from supers, freeing them of the thrall. It all culminates in a final confrontation where Helen beats Evelyn by a conveniently placed flare gun.The characters more or less follow a circle than an arc, rehashing their original stories. Bob for some reason, is more selfish in this pursuit of being a legal superhero again, which wasn't a trait of his in the original. He loved his family more and just wanted a taste of the glory days, but always put them first. Violet becomes an insufferable and disrespectful know-it-all who gets mad about her crush losing his memory of her when she should really be grateful that her secret identity is so easily kept in tact, which was her own fault in the first place as well. Dash and Frozone aren't utilized much, but the biggest sin has to go to Jack-Jack. He is a walking plot device with no rules to his powers, as they simply do whatever the plot needs. Moreover, his presence in the film has all the earmarks of being a merchandise grab, as his value in the actual story could have been mitigated to a much higher degree with little loss. Still, the voice acting is on point at the end of the day, which helps to save face.The pacing and run time on this film is all over the place. The original slickly showed you the daily life of a super integrated into society for a short time before getting into the exciting meat. This film focuses on it so much to the point of painful. And at 2 hours, it starts to wear on you quickly.There was a fourteen year gap in the development between the Incredibles movies and it's surprising to see not much has changed on the VFX side of things. I see improvements, but nothing that screamed 'revolutionary'. What you see is serviceable and not bad on the eyes. Everyone and everything is recognizable, to which I am grateful. But it is not anything your eyes will pop out at.The soundtrack is a slightly less memorable take of the original. You will still hear beats from that first movie that were so iconic, but then there are tracks that are just white noise by comparison. Sound design itself is still solid... when it's used. Rarely do you get the audio cocktail the original had.The rewatchability is much lower on this film and I can almost guarantee most, if presented with the option of watching this or the original, will 99 out of 100 times pick the original.Overall, The Incredibles 2 feels more of a chore to get through than the original. The plot isn't as airtight and humor often falls flat or even resorts to immaturity. The characters regress in likability across the board. The graphics and sound are mostly serviceable. And the desire to rewatch is much lower than the previous. While it definitely never ventures into the territory of unwatchable or even bad, I really cannot call it 'good' either. It's an ok-at-best flick that's probably worthy of the 2 hour investment, if only for a solo watch.","10/10"
"Incredibles 2","escobedojason","18 July 2018","A lot of people say that the drinking and cussing was not needed, but you have to remember that even though it is pixar, that doesn't mean it always has to follow to rules of being nice at all times. The first incredibles was awesome because it was a little adult. The first one had that action that left people dead. Dash made 2 people crash and possibly die. The villian gets taken into a jet engine. Thats adult. This second film exapands upon that level of seriousness. It is action filled and still has the same stylish tone as the first. Just because people don't like the drinking, it doesn't mean its a bad movie. Just over protective parents who don't want their kids to know about ""adult"" things in a pixar movie.","9/10"
"Power Rangers","Minus_The_Beer","31 March 2018","With the seemingly endless popularity of superheroes, robots, dinosaurs and gigantic monsters on the big screen, it was only a matter of time before a franchise where superheroes transform into gigantic robotic dinosaurs to battle gigantic monsters would be resurrected. That's right: everyone's favorite half-hour toy commercial from the '90s is back to kick nostalgic butt! The ""Power Rangers"" have been re-booted with a slickly made, big-budget popcorn flick that wants to remind you of your care-free childhood days spent in front of the TV. It also probably wants you to forget the atrocious 1995 film.
It almost works.
With a gang of fresh young faces in place, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers get back into action, sans the clumsy Mighty Morphin title. Also missing in action is a great deal of the trademark humor and inherent corniness that made the original series so much fun to watch, even long after most of us had grown up and out of it. In place of these elements are a stronger focus on character and backstory, as we not only get to know more about the teen titans, but also about their allies and enemies. Yep, even the Rangers' big-headed mentor Zordon and his haywire sidekick Alpha (played by Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader respectively) get some time to shine, as we learn more about how they came into contact with the power of the Rangers. Likewise, villainess Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) is given ample time to roam and wreak havoc, as she murders her way across town in search of gold, all the while jamming some Social Distortion. We're a long way from after-school Fox TV, friends.
The kids all play variations of the characters we came to recognize in the original run. Here we have Jason/The Red Ranger, the natural leader and jock with a heart of gold, as played by Dacre Montgomery. Stealing nearly every scene is RJ Cyler as Billy/The Blue Ranger, a brainiac who proudly confesses to being on the spectrum. Naomi Scott steps into the role of Kimberly/The Pink Ranger. This version of Kimberly is a rebel and a frequent target of bullies (haters gon' hate). Rounding out the crew are Becky G as Trini/The Yellow Ranger and Ludi Lin as Zack/The Black Ranger. These characters feel slightly under-cooked in comparison to the three ""leads."" Trini and Zack both appear troubled and withdrawn, proud conformists who are tough as nails. A glimpse into their respective home lives gives each character a little more dimension. Together, the five teens must learn to work together if they are to stop Rita's plan to end all human life. In spite of the film's short-comings, all five actors are on point and keep things are lively as possible, even when the script fails them.
Most folks are going to come into a film like this expecting a super smash of monster on robot action, and although the back half of the film makes good on that promise, the hour and a half (!) that leads up to it might leave some viewers (especially the younger ones) a bit cold. While the increased focus on character is more than welcome (given how shallow the original series was), it gets a bit redundant a third of the way in. The new characters are established firmly from the start, but the story doesn't quite know how to advance from there, leaving the middle piece of the film a little laggy and repetitive. A lot of the story beats we've seen from other (and better) superhero films are repeated and to be quite honest, it gets hard not to tune out. When the slam-bang finale comes crashing down, it (mostly) quenches the thirst for big, goofy fun but not quite. The end result is a film that feels a little muddled, as if the committee that pieced it together didn't quite know what target audience they were trying to reach. Not as dumb as ""Transformers"" but not as fun as, say, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ""Power Rangers"" straddles the middle a little too comfortably. Or maybe these characters and their accompanying concepts work better in smaller doses. There's still some fun to be had here, make no mistake, but more often than not, it feels like these Rangers are operating with slightly diminished power.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","NewGirlNickMiller","30 November 2018","Everyone that is writing a negative review of this film is saying that it didn't live up to expectations, ruined their nostalgia, was boring, was stupid, etc. So let's address some of that.Didn't live up to expectations:
If you're going into this movie expecting something amazing and ground-breaking, you're going to have a bad time. If you're expecting something more like Transformers, you'll have fun.Ruined nostalgia:
Nostalgia is a self-ruiner. Nothing ever lives up to what you remember when you were a wide-eyed child filled with wonder. Let's face it. Power Rangers was a really dumb kid's show even back then. We all just think it was baller, because we were kids when it was airing.Boring:
Some say it was boring, and I'll admit it was slow to start. It took a while to get it's stride, but if you can stick it out, it's a pretty fun movie.Stupid:
This movie has all the teenage high schooler tropes. I mean, you would almost think it were a modern day John Hughes film in the first half hour or so, because god is it tropey. That's okay though. I feel like the production team did this on purpose. This film doesn't take itself that seriously, really.My take on it is that it was fun. There were parts where I cringed. There were parts where I wanted to just shut it off. I'm glad I stuck it out, because it's not a terrible film as long as you're not expecting something on the level of Hitchcock. If you are expecting that...why?Remember, think for yourself when it comes to film. Don't take reviews too seriously, because not everyone has the same tastes.","7/10"

"Power Rangers","nogodnomasters","15 July 2017","The film opens in the Cenozoic Era with aliens coming to Earth. In New Age fashion, a crystal in the earth creates a life force.

Perhaps the worst thing you can do is to share your innermost secret with a group of teen peers, but that is what they did in order to become a team and save the world vs. a Gold Golem.The younger you are, the more likely you will enjoy the film. It is aimed at the teen. It had great graphics, although the Alpha-5 was as convincing as the alien in ""Explorers."" Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) was a little on the cartoonish side and I am not convinced of her alien name.I was too old to have watched the MMPR so I can not make comparisons.

"Power Rangers","amichnea","27 June 2017","Anyone that was a child when the Power Rangers was on TV will be early 30's to late early 40's. Writing a review based on your memories stating that this movie destroyed the Power Rangers of old time is just sad.I actually liked it and yes I am one of those kids. The movie is very simple. They are building up the characters, each being a misfit, they are teenagers so YES you will get a lot of the teenager drama that comes along with being a teenager. It is pretty much an Origin Superhero movie, slow at start but ending with a Bang when the heroes discover their full potential.Why would anyone compare this to the Transformers? It is filmed the same way, the special effects are pretty much the same but this is because at the end of the day they have similarities (robots, transforming) and they can only show them one way. Bear in mind that Power Rangers type of series have been around since the 70s and 80s especially in Japan and China. So NO they did not copy Transformers and the first Power Ranger movie was actually done before any of the Transformers movies. Unfortunately any movie that shows big robots and morphings will be compared to the Transformers.The movie does keep true to the original series and I have enjoyed it. I also liked seeing some of the original rangers in the crowd.Does it deserve a 10? Probably not but neither does a 1 nor do other waste of time movies/series deserve a 10.

"Power Rangers","lesleyharris30","15 April 2017","Power Rangers is an atrocious movie with a poorly developed plot and an disinterested cast. I did not have high expectations for this film, but I was a fan of the television series as a child and thought it would be a fun tribute. Instead of that, it takes what made the Power Rangers a hit in the late nineties and forcefully updates it for today's standards, taking itself far too seriously for such a ridiculous property. The majority of the cast are uninspired, clearly only there for a pay check. The Rangers, with the exception of RJ Cyler and Ludi Lin, seem to have no desire or ambition to act. The more A list cast do not shine either, Elizabeth Banks is far too sweet and attractive to thrill us as the lead antagonist, while Bryan Cranston just seemed out of place, which was a shame, as he could do so much better. For an action film, it is not very exciting. It takes up far too much time setting up the Rangers, followed by about twenty minutes of poor action sequences that are jam packed with CGI and poor one liners. I found myself regretting my decision to watch this movie more and more throughout. Dull and poorly paced, Power Rangers is too serious to be fun, but not serious enough to be intriguing, I would avoid this one. A group of teenagers use new powers that they have been bestowed with to protect the galaxy. Best Performance: RJ Cyler / Worst Performance: Elizabeth Banks","2/10"
"Power Rangers","Mr-Fusion","7 July 2017","Two hours long and it takes them 90 minutes to finally don the costumes. That's the essence of ""Power Rangers"", a movie that offers plenty of buildup with a clumsy payoff. A lot of money and time went into the mo-cap, but there's something to be said about the fluidity of spandex fight scenes. And strangely enough, I think I liked it better while it was a generic superhero origin story, ""Breakfast Club"" archetypes and all. Even still, these are decent actors and they breathe life into a pretty weak script.It's funny, I was never a Power Rangers fan growing up (though I certainly put in the effort) but I didn't end up liking this movie because of the writing; too much effort turning this into a serious teen drama and not focusing on the goofy appeal of the show. It was silly then and it should be now.5/10","5/10"
"Power Rangers","tr91","22 June 2017","Most people had already decided that this film was going to be bad, so you knew it would get panned either way.I liked the original show as a kid in the 90s but with the numerous spin off shows and movies that followed, I never really stuck with the series. I got older and simply moved on to different things. Apart from the basics, my memory of Power Rangers had pretty much faded. This isn't exactly a film that we needed but I thought it's 2017, it probably has a big budget so it may well be fun. While I found it to be watchable, there was plenty of faults that even a casual viewer will notice. The story is simple but takes way too long to get going. There is simply not enough material here to warrant a 2 hour run time. There isn't really anything exciting about any of the characters and the first half just shows them meeting each other. I liked Billy (pretty funny) the most. OK so an hour later and a lot of talk about nothing, we learn that there is a villain who wants to destroy the world and the Power Rangers are the only ones who can stop her from doing so. Obviously. Then we have some failed Morphin and finally they suit up (with like 20 minutes left of the film). The action scenes were good but nothing special. The suits were kinda weird and the Red Ranger looked more like The Flash. I would say the thing that annoyed me most about this film was the dialogue. I can honestly say I think they spoke more about Krispy Kreme than being actual Power Rangers. Too much unnecessary build up and the action scenes at the end just weren't spectacular enough. Despite all the faults, I still found it to be watchable. I don't think it is really aimed at fans of the old shows/people wanting nostalgia. It is more about gaining a new set of fans and it wouldn't surprise me to see more films/shows following on from this one.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","Leofwine_draca","7 January 2018","POWER RANGERS is a big screen outing for the 1990s TV phenomenon and much better than I expected it would be given the usual quality of a Hollywood blockbusters. It's heavily inspired by the likes of PACIFIC RIM and TRANSFORMERS and yet it has a character all of its own, and it's chock-full of references to the TV series as well as Japanese comic book creations in general. The main good thing about it is that the cast remains likeable despite being young, fresh, and too good looking by half; RJ Cyler is a particular stand-out in this respect. The film gets progressively more and more immersed in CGI as the story progresses, but it remains light and watchable and funny at times. Elizabeth Banks threatens to spoil things with another over the top performance but thankfully doesn't have too much screen time.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","mickdansforth","12 June 2017","I was a young adult by the time Power Rangers started broadcasting on Fox. I enjoyed the Toei footage that Saban interwove with their newly shot footage for the show. By the Saved-By-The-Bell type footage of the American kids in Power Rangers made the show unwatchable to me. In the 00's, after buying Godzilla vs Megaguirus from Hong Kong on Ebay, I started buying Hong Kong DVDs of Ultraman, Masked Rider and eventually, semi-reluctantly some of the Super Sentai shows. And I found the Super Sentai shows, minus any US shot footage, to be really great. Absolutely nothing I heard or saw about this movie before seeing it appealed to me in any way. I don't trust Saban as a creative force, and none of the gritty reboot talk, or reveals appealed to me in any way. And Bryan Cranston in blockbusters is usually him cashing a big check for as little screen time as possible, and I have no idea if he was actually on set with his costars or not, but if he was not, you can't tell from the performances because the ""teens"" sell it. But once we start meeting the kids, I found them and their stories very compelling. It quickly became obvious that instead of retreading Save By The Bell of the teen drama, they were using The Breakfast Club as source material. And it works. This movie makes you care about these kids and their struggles. The exploration of their power is fun, and the all out action is great, if short, but the heart of this movie is the team learning to love themselves and each other and how to work together as a team. David Denman from Traffic Light (who was also Skip on Angel) was great as the Red Ranger's father. They used him a lot and he played his part well. Erica Cerra from Eureka has one short scene as the Yellow Ranger's mom, where the camera never rests on her long enough to recognize her, but she did her part great. Elizabeth Banks is awesome per usual and Bill Hader doesn't ruin anything. I hope this movie pulls in enough money to warrant a sequel because I definitely want to see more.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","jaidanh","3 March 2021","The majority of this Power Rangers movie is just some teen angst drama. Now I have nothing against teen angst being portrayed in film and TV. But we're talking about a Power Rangers movie. This movie tries too hard to be serious and mature. There's humor every once in a while, but it doesn't fit with the serious tone. And while we're on the subject of seriousness, the color palette used in this film is very dull. It's the same washed-out color palette used in Man of Steel and Fantastic Four, which has been used in so many movies, and it's completely outdated.The script is quite bland with several pop-culture references. Some of the dialogue can be inappropriate for the kids that watch this film.The acting is okay, but the characters have feeble character development and can be very unlikeable. The most likable characters I can think of are Jason and Billy. Other than that, there's not a lot of characterization for the heroes of this movie. I wouldn't consider them fit to be role models. The Rangers don't have strong chemistry with each other. In the original TV show, they were already friends before becoming the Power Rangers. In this film, since they're only meeting each other for the first time, they fail to build a connection and understand each other. Even Zordon can be seen as unlikeable. In this film, he can sound irritable, whereas Zordon in the original show was more optimistic.Some aspects in this film are just stolen from The Breakfast Club. I'm not saying that because the film opens with a detention scene. There's way more than that. For starters, the Power Rangers all follow the same character traits as the main characters in The Breakfast Club: The Nerd (Billy), the Jock (Jason), the Outcast (Trini), the Princess (Kimberly), and the Rebel (Zack). The campfire scene where the Power Rangers reveal bits about themselves is similar to The Breakfast Club's circle confession.One of the BIGGEST issues I have with this film is the mass product placement from Krispy Kreme. My god, it's everywhere between the middle and end of the film. The final battle literally takes place at a local Krispy Kreme.Speaking of the final battle, it's the ONLY fight scene in this 2-hour movie. If you were expecting this movie to be packed with fighting sequences, get ready to be disappointed.So yeah, I wasn't entirely pleased with this film. It doesn't have much replay value, and I wouldn't recommend this film to kids. I liked the visual effects and the soundtrack, but yeah, that's about it. This film was just very uninteresting. Hopefully, the next reboot does something much better.","3/10"
"Power Rangers","I_Ailurophile","11 February 2023","This does NOT make a good impression right out of the gate. The brief prologue accentuates that this new vision of the franchise aims to be dark and gritty in the same way as too many modern superhero movies are; early exposition greets us with boorish ""humor,"" and overemphasis of shadows and dark hues in the color palette to further cement the grit. 'Power Rangers' concretely informs in early scenes - through direction, cinematography, action, stunts, effects, music, and more - that it's slick, modern, cool, and flashy. All it actually needed to be was fun, with cartoonish violence commensurate to what we saw in the TV show of the 90s. Instead we're greeted with grim violence that tries to be as realistic as possible, and cartoonish introduction of the characters' powers that's frankly a little cringe-worthy. (Remember Edward's demonstrations of his powers in the first 'Twilight' movie?) It tries so hard to update the concept with modern sensibilities of the MCU or DCEU, and with a mind for what teen and young adult viewers are accustomed to in recent years, that it becomes common and unexceptional, loses sight of what made 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' such a hit in the first place, and to be blunt, just becomes tired and obnoxious.It all looks great. A lot of hard work went into the production that I deeply appreciate. The diversity of the primary cast and characters is most welcome (though of course the chief protagonist has to be a white dude), and I think the cast performs well (even those in small supporting parts; hi, Erica Cerra!). Elizabeth Banks has minimal time on-screen as villain Rita Repulsa, but she's clearly loving it. The effects look good, both the practical creations and the regrettable overabundance of CGI (that is at least on par with anything in modern action flicks); the sets, costume design, and hair and makeup work are terrific. The crew put in good work all around. I don't agree with all the choices made behind the scenes, mind you, including instances of direction or cinematography. The new design of Zordon's lair, and how he presents, are plainly over the top, as is the new appearance of the power suits. The design of the Zords here frankly reminds too much of how the Transformers look in Michael Bay's ""live-action"" films - nondescript chunks of metal with no substantial identity, little more than junkyard kluges with slightly different color schemes and configurations.And that might be the real takeaway here, that 'Power Rangers' has no meaningful identity of its own. It's clearly a reimagination of an established franchise, yes, but it specifically takes all its cues from Marvel, and DC, and other blockbuster action flicks of the last 15 years or so (not least 'Pacific Rim') that after a point all tend to start blending together. This also applies, emphatically, to the writing. Characters and their development, dialogue, scene writing, narrative, plot development, humor, the forging of the team, and anything else one might name all work overtime to emulate comparable titles, becoming kind of indistinguishable in the process. The writing informs the execution in turn, so it and the direction, action sequences (that effectively wait until the last quarter to show up), music, and to some degree as well the acting, all share the same traits in some capacity: heavy-handed, overwrought, ham-handed, lacking tact or nuance, if not simply imitative and unremarkable - and at the same time, often coming across as weirdly oversimplified. The location of the MacGuffin leads to cheeky jokes that I suppose someone thought was unique and clever; the last moment in which we see the Megazord is both copied and pasted from other such fare, and altogether aggravating in its kitsch. Scenes of team building come off as the perfunctory, obligatory connecting of dots rather than earnest plot. And so on.I admire the effort. I distinctly disagree with too many decisions that were made in how to proceed with this feature, but everyone involved put their best foot forward and gave it their all, the cast and crew especially. I would, genuinely, like to see stars Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Becky G, and Ludi Lin in other pictures, and see more of what they're capable of. Yet whether the blame lies with director Dean Israelite, the team of writers, the producers, or someone else or some combination thereof, 2017's 'Power Rangers' is bereft of what made its predecessors so enjoyable in the first place (even at their worst), and just disappears into a very crowded sea of modern action films. There were, I think, some very good ideas here, but they rather get lost in the mix, and at best the title is basically just average. Factor in particular faults that grate on one's patience, and my favor takes another step down. Why, though in different ways, I think this is sadly on par with ill-considered franchise antecedent 'Turbo: A Power Rangers movie,' wherein the crew did good work, and the cast tried, but the writers and directors were just phoning it in. Well, no one is phoning in their contributions here, but the result is unfortunately just as uninspiring when all is said and done. I wish all participants nothing but the best, but whether you're an action buff or a devotee of all things Power Rangers, I just don't think this rendition makes the grade.","4/10"
"Power Rangers","subxerogravity","23 March 2017","Another installment in nostalgia.When I first heard about the Power Rangers being brought back as a film franchise I was pretty jazzed about it. It does not hurt that the closest thing to bad press I heard about the movie was that they needed to push back the filming, which only allowed them to add the star power of Bryan Cranston and Elisabeth banks.Only indifference I had towards the movie was that as corny as the TV show was the concept of a group of overachieving teenagers being selected to become the best of the best makes sense (Especially because they are teenagers, they should be the best of the best at lease). Because dark is cool these days, the Rangers needed to have more edge to them, which is why this new team is made of ""diamonds in the rough"" who society has scrub off as screw-ups. So the idea is that Bryan Cranston who plays the big giant head Zordon, has the power coins pick those who have the potential to be the best of the best.Out of all the superhero movies that are coming out, Power Rangers is not the best of the best, it's definitely a diamond in the rough that has potential, but still needs more training. I did like the cast of teenagers who had some very distinctive personalities, as they try to even out the characters. I did love the fact that the Blue Ranger was played by a black dude, and The Black Ranger was played by an Asian dude (it's less distracting than what happen in the TV show).Bryan Cranston's star power did nothing to make his Zordon a better giant head, but Elisabeth Banks was great as Rita Repulsa. In a time with Superhero movies having weak antagonist, I got to say, I enjoyed what Banks did with the character and loved to see her on the screen.So I went into this really wanting to see this and I was not disappointed. It's not really what I expected as it's not the kung fu spectacular the TV show was, but it is a good movie. Not great just good.http://cinemagardens.com","7/10"
"Power Rangers","WhenAmyMetSalad","21 April 2017","TL;DR - Slow, boring, not entertaining, Fant4stic was better. I followed this movie around the time it was first announced and even partook in the boards and seeing all the news and leaks about the movie. I was not too fond of certain things about this movie especially certain casting as I felt it wouldn't fit. I honestly really wanted to enjoy this movie but when the trailer hit I had a bad feeling and should have stuck to it. My friend dragged me to go watch it with him and I hated almost every minute. After reading mixed reviews the ones that resonated with me are the ones that shared my same opinions. The movie lacked good comedy, needed to improve on action. It dragged and dragged with these poorly acted characters and mundane character development for our protagonists. The only fun character was Rita. Elizabeth Banks did a great job making that character hers and making her feel more menacing than she was in the show. I've only ever liked her in one other franchise and that was The Hunger Games so to be honest I am surprised I liked Rita as much.--- ***SPOILERS BELOW***---The movie started off good with the ending of a battle scene which introduced our antagonist and the seriousness of a threat our heroes will encounter down the road. Rita literally kills the previous Ranger team and is the ever so loved Green Ranger which was teased and theorized throughout set photo leaks. This scene and the final Battle where Rita gets B-chSlapped to the moon was the only entertaining thing in this whole movie. Everything in between was utterly boring. You will seriously have a more fun time watching the Ghostbusters Remake or the Fant4stic reboot.","2/10"
"Power Rangers","rgkarim","24 March 2017","In the 90's Saban unleashed onto our homes five teenage heroes dress in multicolored, state of the art underwear. What followed was legacy of aspiring actors fighting men in ashen grey costumes, before turning their attention to unique costumed antagonists that tried to stop their quest. And to this day Power Rangers continues to be a hit amidst the adolescent world as Nickelodeon continues to inspire them to fight as the rainbow warriors. So of course, we needed a movie to really seal the deal, based on the original series that started it all. Robbie K here to cover another movie. Let's get started. Summary: If you were a fan of the series like I was, then you will certainly be looking for that nostalgic adventure you had as a kid. Well the movie is able to bring some of that back as traditional characters (in new, hot, youthful skins) return to fight the forces of evil. But past the new cast, you'll be go go going crazy for all the throwbacks including: Zords, monsters, Rita's dramatic speeches, cameos, and of course the suits. It's fun to relive those childhood moments, making one laugh at all the memories that come rushing back in this new adventure. But if nostalgia won't make you smile, then certainly the comedy of the movie will be an entertaining factor. Power Rangers surprisingly is funny (and not in the cheesy way the classic series was). Each of the teens has their moments where they put their foot in their mouth or get a taste of humility as they eat pavement. But it is Billy who steals the show, as the autistic youth delivers well-timed comedy that grounds all the drama brought by this new generation of rangers. Yes, you heard me drama, this origin movie has far more drama than the series had back then and with it some surprising character depth. Where the 90's was cutesy love and bullying, this movie goes deeper down the teenage angst path. It works at times and helps expand on what once was limited roles. As for the action, Power Rangers is also decent in this category as well. This film has some fast-paced karate chopping action, that quickly melds into robot on monster smashing. The special effects are semi impressive, not so much in terms of realism, but capturing the spunk of Power Rangers. The Zords in particular are much smoother, and the modern twist on their design matches the edgier theme of the movie. And of course, there are lots of thrilling explosions and sound effects to bring it all to the front. While not as cheesy as Saban's classic fights, the battles in this film still have that energy we all fell in love with. Summary: Despite the deeper lore of the series, the teenage issues were also a little eye rolling as well. I know not to expect a masterpiece, but this Power Ranger plot felt like an after school special meeting a special effects show. I'm sure this will speak to many of the modern generation, but these issues just felt out of place compared to those in the 90s. Plus, the rebellious, delinquent protagonists aren't necessarily the ideal role models for the younger generations. Perhaps it was also the darker atmosphere that also detracted it from me. Despite added suspense and danger, the darker moments made the movie less fun for me at times. And to be honest, some of the darker moments were a bit disturbing at times, so please exercise caution if your kids are easily scared. Speaking of scary, the new direction they took with Rita Repulsa was not the most comforting thing to see. This portrayal was much more nightmarish, replacing Rita's grandiosity with pure insanity and lust as she feasted on ""gold"" from every source. While the edginess wins points for danger, the creepy (somewhat adulterated) portrayal of Rita did not impress me, nor did the overacting (again dramatic) walks/speeches she made through the movie. In addition, I wasn't a fan of the new Goldar, wondering why they replaced the cheesy (yet creative) chimera design for a CGigoldenVelveeta monster? Yes, the monsters certainly lacked that design we all loved, for again darker, edgier forms. In regards to the action, well as always, I wanted more. Power Rangers runs just a little over two hours, but only about twenty minutes of that is actually action. It would have been nice to have a little more investment in the combat scenes to really deliver the promised punch the first 90 minutes promised. For one thing, it would have been nice for all the weapons, not just a random appearing sword, to make an appearance as they fought for the sake of the world. That minor detail aside, the kung Fu scenes could have been longer, and the Zords could have had a little more coordination than just one or two taking a punch. In addition, the edgier Rita needed some more time to show off her skills (other than speeches and walking through CGI streets). The Verdict:Power Rangers is certainly a fun stroll down memory lane, filled with plenty of nostalgic references to make you feel sort of like a kid again. With a new edge comes character development and special effects that for the most part work. Yet, there are still some balance issues that need work, including stepping back from the darkness and increase the emphasis on action (and story). Still not a bad origins story. Worth a trip to the theater? For the special effects and adventure, definitely, but there are other movies better worth the price of admission. My scores:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0","7/10"
"Power Rangers","pulkit110","4 July 2017","Five high school students accidentally acquire powers that make them super strong and fast and have to save the world. There's not much new going on in this movie as compared to the other super hero movies and it's more an origins story rather than a full fledged Power Rangers film. The worst thing about the movie is the villain. Rita is pretty bland and there's nothing interesting about her. The only thing going for the movie, in my opinion, is the humour and CGI.

"Power Rangers","afijamesy2k","23 March 2017","You know when I was 12 years old, I saw power rangers, I thought the first 2 seasons (1993-95) represent splendid action, suspense and real characters, but once season 3 came it all went downhill and this movie is another example at how jumped the shark the power rangers franchise has become, the performances are awful, the story is completely and absolutely confusing, the screenplay is a mess and the editing is a trainwreck, now I love bryan Cranston he's always been a wonderful actor, but he is truly wasted in this one as zordon, a man who help 5 teens with their magical powers and their customs to save angel grove from monsters and the evil rita repulsa (played terribly by Elizabeth banks) and other nonsense, this is just a pathetic and useless attempt to revive the power rangers franchise, it is just awful, this is one of the year's worst films, no offense to my friend who is a power rangers fan, but this movie stinks.","2/10"
"Power Rangers","moviemattb","27 March 2017","It has been three years, since this was first announced as Lionsgate and Saban teamed up to do reboot of ""Power Rangers,"" and now it is finally here for the time in 2017. This movie came out on my Birthday, and got to see it the day after it came out, and all I got to say that ""Power Rangers"" was a morphinominal experience. I had such a fun time with this movie, and really had the pleasure to see a ""Power Rangers"" movie on the big screen like I never had before. I will not spoil this movie for you, because I want you to be surprised by it. Pressing on, the movie tells our five teenagers with attitude as they all come from different backgrounds, when they stumbled across as they found these power coins that gives them their own strengths and found a spaceship as they meet their mentor Zordon and his robotic assistant Alpha 5 as they are chosen to become Power Rangers. While that's going on, we have Rita Repulsa as she has come to Angel Grove to wipe out humanity as our five main heroes must come together as a team in order to save the world. It may be your typical origin story like you have seen a million times before, but it works on its own level. With that said, this is a darn good looking movie, and this does not look like a Michael Bay movie. This is definitely Dean Israelite's movie, the director that brought us ""Project Almanac"" which I really enjoyed that movie, and he really does care on making this movie as he knows how the fan-base really loves ""Power Rangers"" and never acting as a director that really wants a paycheck. I give him huge props for putting a lot care into making this movie, and his direction is absolutely wonderful. The way the movie opens, which I can't spoiled has made my jaw dropped and it was an incredible way to open. The movie's tone is dark, but it still retains the essence of ""Power Rangers,"" where it never forgets the cheese factors. This movie is like a cross between ""Chronicle"" meets ""The Breakfast Club."" I really do love the look of the movie as it is beautifully well filmed, and really has that the kind of atmosphere as it does look gritty, but still has the colors. Brian Tyler's music is epic, and I loved that kind of vibe as it really sounds very sci-fi, but for a coming of age superhero movie. You do hear, the ""Power Rangers"" theme song which it does make it a treat for fans that grew up with the series. The cast in this movie are just fantastic. Bryan Cranston as Zordon is really remarkable as he embodies the character as not only he plays as a wise mentor, but very complex as he is trying to get our heroes to become Power Rangers. Bill Hader as Alpha is really funny, and enjoyable to watch. I do enjoy the redesign of this character as he looks more like an alien robot, instead of some actor in a suit. No disrespect on the original Alpha, just like to point that out. Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa is really funny, but quite menacing at the same time. This Rita does a whole lot more, than just sitting at her palace doing nothing and she really does fight the Rangers. As for our heroes, Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, Ludi Lin, Becky Gomez, and R.J. Cyler have all done such a superb job to have great chemistry together as their acting is very natural and they all do have a charisma. They played flawed teenagers, as they go through real life issues instead of just being goodie goods from the show. They really are the Power Rangers for this generation. I am very pleased for this movie to go deeper into the mythology of Power Rangers as opposed to what the show couldn't do. The action in this movie is pretty good, and so does the special effects. The pacing is never slow, and really does keep me invested with the story, and as well with its characters. The humor, thankfully, doesn't have any of the burp or fart jokes like what happened to the recent ""TMNT"" movies. This has the right kind of humor like what Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have, and it knows when to have fun. I did cry during that one moment in the movie, but once again, cannot spoil it for you. Can't forget about the Zords and the suits as they look really cool in motion. Love them very much. Any flaws? Yes, but they are minored. As much as there was character development for the Rangers, but we kept getting more from Jason, Kimberly and Billy. Sure Zack and Trini do have moments to shine, but you wish there was more to them. Nevertheless, there was enough to care about them. As for Goldar, I thought the design of him looks interesting, and can see why they went with it as it fits within the context of the movie, but you wish he had more of a personality instead of being a run of the mill monster. Sure he is intimidating, but really wanted more from him. So I find this Goldar both good and bad at the same time. I really love this movie, and really do enjoy the aspects of teamwork as it does add to the heart of the movie. ""Power Rangers"" is a loving tribute to the series, and you are going to have a wonderful time at the movies as it appeals to the old and new generation of fans. Kids can enjoy it, and so can adults. This was the best Birthday that I've ever had, and I am giving ""Power Rangers"" a 10 out of 10.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","MichaelNontonMulu","22 March 2017","My wife and I were pretty entertained with this movie. It was quite  full of humor and fun all around. Watching the new Power Rangers suits  were also pretty cool, especially if we compared against the suits from  the original TV series back in the 1990s. Of course the special effects  in this movie was pretty amazing. The CGI was done pretty nicely and  neat. Loved the action sequence in the last part of the movie during  the fight between the Rangers and Goldar. Sound effects were good, and  maybe would be more amazing if you see in Dolby Atmos theaters.  After watching it for full 2 hours, the movie duration seemed to be  just nice. It was not too rushed in the process of characters  introduction and the time spent for the training to become the Power  Rangers felt sufficient. It did not take too long or too short, and  still have enough time for the big finale. Overall, the pace of the  movie felt just perfect. The movie had brief moments of jokes that felt  more appropriate for teenagers and not suitable for children. So I feel  that the movie seemed to be aimed more for teenagers rather than for  children, although the original series were actually shown in kids TV.  This is also the reason why a lot of adults also watched this movie to  reminiscent the good fun time when they watched the series (my wife was  a great example of this audience).  In addition, the movie also had some cheesy moments and felt very  light. There was no over-complication of plots, just a simple good old  fashion pop corn movie to be enjoyed without over thinking. For this  kind of movie, people should not expect a deep conversation and various  twists. This is a movie that I feel would provide the fans of the  original series satisfaction. Almost all the characters were there in  the movie, with of course other characters that might join the sequels.  This movie also had some brief interesting scene during the mid end-  credit part. But there was nothing at the very end. So there is no need  to wait till the very last scene if you are in a rush to the wash room.   So if you are looking for a fun light team of superheroes movie based  on the popular 1990s TV series, then you would not be disappointed and  you would be entertained by this. But if you are looking for a heavier  super hero movies from popular comic books like Marvel comics or DC  comics kind, then this might not be your thing. Especially if you are  expecting a heavy drama full of logics kind of movie. The choice is  yours.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","vasco_cid","24 March 2017","High on the heels of frantic superhero revivals of past, Lionsgate acquired another niche property of the 90's in hopes of launching another multi-million dollar franchise. Luckily enough for me, being a long time hardcore fan, Power Rangers was the chosen product. I realise the cynicism of my over excitement for this film and my overwhelming praise for it, being a detractor of the Marvel cinematic universe, but subjectivism and personal nostalgia end up playing a big part in relating to these films, so... tough luck.Power Rangers is not and was never a franchise for everyone. Its sole selling point was a very childish one, that you either related to or not. The story lines and plots were recycled, thin and repetitive and it's very cheesy and campy nature was never shed under a rug; it was always thrown directly into our faces. Nevertheless, the ""narrative"" potential of the series was hinted on some occasions and was only sporadically developed either because budget constraints held it back or because it never HAD to.What Dean Israelite did here was nevertheless smart, sensible and necessary: adapting the property into the 21st century, focusing and developing characters (that were never), taking creating liberties that were harmless and present us a full-fledged nostalgia punch, armed with heart, humour and excitement. The same as the original series, the film knows it's cheesy. It knows the premise is far-fetched. But the source material asks that of you; and the reason why we escape to movies (these genre specifically) is not to find some way to fit the story into our world. It is to find escapism, fun and entertainment - and this Power Rangers (film) delivers just that and then some. Power Rangers is not a perfect film. It will not please everyone, it will (sadly) not gross obscene amounts of money to launch the very optimistic plans for multiple sequels; but today I woke up with a wide grin knowing that this property was adapted and honoured so well despite its shortcomings, so sensibly to its publicised characters backgrounds and, most importantly, so respectfully to its legacy and fanbase.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","MikeC19","11 May 2017","I was never a huge fan of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", but I went in, open to trying this film. I was sorely, sorely disappointed. I left this movie thinking, ""This was a *bad* movie!"" Now, there are movies out there, that are absolute garbage, the acting is bad, almost everything is bad. I admit, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, however, there's a lot wrong with it! The Bad: There's crude humor, lame and dated jokes we've heard in hundreds of other movies, some bad language and dozens of tired movie clichés. We've seen it all before is what I'm saying. There's is very little to be enjoyed in this movie. It's an origin story, that kind of lags a bit, and then the action is cranked up near the end, but it's not really that exciting. We've all seen the ""misfits who learn to work together"" story line, and that's all this is. I'm surprised that the creator of the original ""Power Rangers"" OK'd this version. It's pretty terrible for the most part.The Good: Bill Hader's character was amusing, Bryan Cranston brings some levity to this, and Elizabeth Banks does a great job of making you hate her character, which proves her acting is good. The main cast is a bit annoying, but they're OK at playing their stereotypes. Also, the score by Bryan Tyler was very good.So: This is a not a movie I would recommend. It may appeal to some teenagers, and it's not the worst thing they could be watching. Overall, it's just a bad film. Case closed.","3/10"
"Power Rangers","destinymckenna","17 June 2017","**CAUTION: CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS** The movie definitely surpassed my expectations. When the trailer was first released, I thought about going to see it but was not truly interested. When it was released to the public, I bought it and was surprised to like it as much as I did. Though it won't be up for any awards, it was enjoyable and fun to watch.If you want to see it because you were a fan of the old television show, be prepared for disappointment. This movie was not made to appeal to the previous generations. It has elements of nostalgia, but if you go into it expecting what you watched as a kid, you will not like this movie.KEEP IN MIND PEOPLE that this movie is PG-13, so if you have KIDS, you might want to look out for cussing, sexual innuendos, rebellious behavior, and scenes that IMPLY things of a sexual nature. It's a film about teenagers, so what more could be expected? Tapping into the teenage world, it was refreshing to see teenage drama play out in a way that is true to the real world.And the characters are truly everything people have been asking for and a major step in the right direction for the film industry. You have black, white, Asian, Indian, and Latino characters all sharing lead roles with one being apart of the LGBTQ+ community and another with Autism. And both aren't shoved into the background at any point. There is even dialogue in the movie referencing their different colored Power Ranger suits and their different ethnicities: ""Five kids, five colors, five different colored kids!""Problems I had with the film include CGI not being the best at times and the characters taking quite a while to mesh together and become a team. You also don't get to see them in their armor until the ending of the movie, which I can understand they tried to build up for suspense but didn't work the way the crew wanted it to. The movie wasn't as action packed as you expect a superhero movie to be. While I liked the fact they incorporated the ranger colors into the costume design, it seemed to me like they tried to overcompensate for the bland armor of the TV show by creating something shiny and new, but that just fell flat in my opinion. They just looked awkward to me in the scenes where they finally had morphed. WOULD RECOMMEND.Despite some points, this movie is overall a great watch. The ending does hold a cliffhanger with the role of the green ranger in the next film, but with how this film did in theaters, I would say do not watch after the credits unless you want to be taunted with the idea of a movie that may not be created. Holding out for a sequel.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","onionbagel","27 March 2017","Obviously everyone who was born after 1993 has seen some Power Rangers TV series, and some may have even seen the 1995 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie, so I don't think I need to explain WHAT Power Rangers are. With that being said, I'll get straight to the review.Whether you are ""young"" (people ranging from toddlers to 20+ year-olds), or an adult who watched Power Rangers with their kid, you will probably like this movie! Is it anything ""new"" or special; no, but it's an entertaining movie all the same. It's a lot like the first installment of most Marvel movies: Iron Man (1), Captain America: The First Avenger, Ant-Man, etc (roughly the first half of the movie is all about the superhero(s) learning to use their powers/learning to BE heroes). It's mainly story-driven, but it's got plenty of action! If you're looking for an Oscar-winning movie (like Lincoln, King's Speech, etc), you're not gonna find it here; however, if you're into action-packed superhero movies with (dumb teenage) comedy sprinkled in, AND you grew up with Power Rangers, you'll love this movie!","9/10"
"Power Rangers","emersonbrowne","13 June 2017","I went into this movie with zero expectations. I only watched Power Rangers a little bit when was younger and was never really into it, but, I got to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I loved it, I think everyone involved did a very good job. There was a good mix of comedy, action, drama and even some sentimental moments. The actors all fit into their roles very well and some of them even surprised me. The cast had some well known actors/actresses such as Elizabeth Banks, Bill Vader and Bryan Cranston who all did very well in their roles. There was also a very good mix of new faces mixed in with Dacre Montgomery (who will be starring in season 2 of Stranger Things later this year.) Ludi Lin who was a very pleasant surprise. I have never heard of him before going to see this movie and now he is someone I am going to look out for in the future. Like probably most of you I have only heard some of Becky G's music but have never really given Her a second thought. When I heard she was going to be a main character in this movie I was a bit hesitant about it. I have never been happier to be proved wrong.She played the role of Trini perfectly and made her character someone that, I think, a lot of people can relate to. Naomi Scott as Kimberly was perfect casting. I loved her in Lemonade Mouth when I was younger so I was excited when I heard that she was cast in Power Rangers. She played the role of Kimberly very well and I definitely will be looking for her more in the future. Everyone did very well in their roles but to me, and I'm sure a lot of you, RJ Cyler stole the show. His portrayal of Billy was perfect. Billy was a very important character being the first superhero to be on the autism spectrum and RJ Cyler absolutely nailed it.Something that I personally am not a fan of in movies is a lot of CGI but, I got to say this movie pulled it off. It wasn't cheesy and went with the movie very well. I also have to mention the soundtrack in the film. every song fit the moment perfectly and added that extra bit to the movie. This movie was about all the characters becoming the Power Rangers and evolving. It takes a long time before they actually become the Power Rangers. The reason for doing this is to show how all of the characters develop throughout the movie which I think was a very dog move. Every character develops really well personally as well as a group. I really hope there is a sequel as the end set it up perfectly. At the end of this movie it shows the teacher at detention introduce a new character, Tommy. Introducing this character would be a good fit for the next movie (if there is one.) If they do decide to do another movie we will be able to see the rangers more experienced and, if they do decide to make Tommy a ranger, we can see how they adjust to the new addition.","9/10"
"Power Rangers","joelhbk","24 March 2017","Don't go in expecting top notch acting, effects or writing. This movie was never meant to be an example of film making excellence. It's a great teen movie. It combines elements of the drama kids go through nowadays and of course heroism and supernatural fiction. It's like Breakfast Club, Chronicles, Pacific Rim and even a bit of Toy Story 3 all combined. I laughed, teared up, threw my hands in the air, and even though I acknowledge it has its issues I enjoyed the heck out of it. The kids have to work on their acting, tho. The comedy was cheesy here and there but it's Power Rangers so what you expect? Also they touch very relevant issues, like mental illness, peer pressure, bullying, etc. And the importance of friendship and unity. It gets pretty emotional here and there. And it doesn't really piggyback that much on the nostalgia element, but when it does it hits you square in the Yay! bone. Go watch it. It's silly entertainment and cheesy fun at its best. Like the first Transformers. I even like it more than the first Transformers actually.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","TheHonestCritic","22 November 2022","""Power Rangers"" (2017), before I start my review, for those who may not have seen the news, Jason David Frank, who played the original green and white ranger, a.k.a. Tommy Oliver, has died. He has acted across many episodes of ""Power Rangers"" media, including a cameo appearance in this ""film"". Not only was he a great actor, but he was also an incredible martial artist and fighter in real life. He did all of the fighting himself when he played his character, which added to his performances. Wow, what a great talent he was! So, let's have a moment of silence for him. All right, let's get back to the review. One thing I will say about this ""movie"", is that the best part, by far, was the Tommy Oliver cameo. Yeah, so you can probably already guess where this is going. This ""film"" sucks! ""Power Rangers"" has a confused and boring storyline, overall terrible acting, and a predictable soundtrack to try and tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, Earth is invaded by aliens and it's up to five teenagers infused with morphing abilities to battle the threat as the Power Rangers. Here's a fun-fact for you all, this ""movie"" is based off the ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" TV series (1993-1995) pilot episode, called ""Day of the Dumpster"". A unique choice for a storyline. I'm not going to clarify anything, but based on the result of this ""film"", it should be renamed ""Dumpster"" instead of ""Power Rangers""! However, that's just scratching the surface, this ""movie"" has a lot of problems. First of all, the tone is completely unbalanced. It doesn't know whether it wants to be serious, or over-the-top. The original ""Power Rangers"" TV series was mostly lighthearted and over-the-top, with some serious moments here and there. That's probably the biggest issue with this ""movie"", it's way too dark and gritty for this concept. Films, or TV shows for that matter, have a line between being dark and realistic, or light and over-the-top. Some movies or shows work better as dark, while some work better as light. Choosing the dark and realistic approach for ""Power Rangers"" was wrong, as it completely detracts from the concept. At some points, I actually forgot I was watching a ""Power Rangers"" film! Bottom line, if you're going to make a movie based on a certain premise, make sure that the tone matches. As for the acting, it's terrible from the majority of the cast! Most of them don't even look like they're trying at all. The best performances come from: Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Watt, RJ Cyler and Jason David Frank. To be honest, Jason David Frank's acting in his short cameo appearance was better than the rest of the acting in this ""film"" as a whole! As far as the soundtrack goes in this ""movie"", it's about as predictable as they come. That was surprising, because the film score was written and composed by Brian Tyler! In most cases, he writes some decent soundtracks for movies! What happened to him here? Now granted, some parts of the film score are okay. But, some parts of it are irritating to listen to. There are some sections of the soundtrack where it just sounds like a cheesy video game! Other than that, the music in this ""movie"" is just not memorable at all Any way, why don't we go ahead and move on to the only two good elements in this piece of trash? The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are cool and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. That being said, they are out-of-place for a movie like this. But, they're still nice to look at though. As far as the special effects go, they are actually very well-done and still hold up today. Which is no surprise, being released in 2017! ""Power Rangers"" is yet another dark adaptation of otherwise lighthearted and over-the-top content that simply does not work. Is it the worst in that category? No, I've seen much worse ones in that regard. I'm struggling to give this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to tell you to avoid this ""film""? No, I think that's pretty obvious. Just stick with the original ""Power Rangers"" TV series instead. All it does is taint the legacy of the ""Power Rangers"" franchise. In this case, it is definitely not morphing time!","4/10"
"Power Rangers","coltonjc","13 June 2017","This movie has high production standards, by far the best production standards for anything Power Rangers or Super Sentai ever. Secondly, everyone on screen does a great job with their characters. The kids in the movie are fantastic actors who will have many big projects in the future.There are scenes that are intended for teens rather than kids, but if you can get over that and just enjoy the movie, you will be pleased. They are looking for a 15-35 demographic here.The main issue is that there is a lack of memorable scenes and the movie needed more action spots. Maybe even dug a little deeper into the mythology behind the Power Rangers. Explain why they exist and who the dangerous people in this world is.I believe the studio and producers were thinking that this would be an origin story and there would be many movies. But it did not do that well at the box office. New ideas are needed, maybe even doing a little more over the top stuff from the TV series. Something is missing here, which is why it got a 7 out of 10 for me. There's so many places that future movies can get to, but not sure if we will get sequels.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","smetin","24 March 2017","When this movie got announced, I was immediately excited. I hadn't watched Power Rangers since I was maybe 10 years old. I still remember coming downstairs on a Sunday morning to watch it. The original movie also sticks in my mind as one of my favourites in my youth. This movie had a lot riding on it, considering so many people like myself would watch this purely for nostalgia's sake.The movie starts in typical Power Rangers style: with some action in a jokey style. As the plot progresses you begin to meet characters who you know will become Power Rangers. They are introduced well and are given a fairly decent backstory, most of which you learn as the movie progresses. I felt as though I knew a little about each of the Rangers before they morphed, although most of it was somewhat of a cliché.I thoroughly enjoyed the training segments, along with the introduction of alpha-5 and Zordon. It really took me back to my childhood, but with a modern spin that I felt was not too drastically different from the original. The villain in this movie was creepy though. Far creepier than she was in the original. I can see why this film was given a slightly more mature rating, because I can see how it would not be suitable for younger children. In this sense, I am slightly annoyed as Power Rangers is in essence a children's thing. By giving it a more mature slant to appeal to the masses, you are depriving the true target audience. But that is just my opinion. It is only in the last 45 minutes where the true action begins and we see our characters morph for the first time. The new suits look awesome and I was impressed with the fighting sequences. When the Zords came into play I actually got goosebumps. The ""Go Go Power Rangers"" song playing the background may have been what caused this, because I truly felt like a kid again. It was great. The final battle scene was excellent; you certainly get enough bang for your buck here!In summation, this is certainly a film worth seeing amidst all the superhero films currently our there. If you are of my generation then I urge you to see this in the cinema, rather than watch it on DVD/Blu-Ray/digital later on. The big screen in addition to the Dolby surround surround sound made this an experience I am so happy to have had.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","mwcrunner","24 March 2017","Excellent here. Very excellent indeed. Just totally awesome. I even like this Power Rangers movie better then the one I've seen as a kid. Looking at the old Power Rangers movie now it's kind of goofy and quirky. This Power Rangers movie however had everything Power Rangers has, except of course Goldar was a giant metamorphosis of gold without that wolf like face. lol. Also Rita Repulsa is way more evil in this then she is in the actual show, since she was just a character swiped from an old Japanese show. lol. Also the Blue Ranger is my favorite. Always has been and always will be. The Megazord in this was wickedly awesome too. We also get to see a cameo of Kimberly and Tommy from the original series. This film had a great cast too. Bryan Cranston as Zordon even. I also like Alpha 5 in this better then him in the old show, cause the old Alpha is kind of dorky. Also Elizabeth Banks was fantastic as Rita Repulsa. It's also nice to see Zordon having a backstory of when he was a Power Ranger. I also know there's gonna be a sequel to this cause we all saw Tommy's jacket at the end. Also the Putties were more intimidating in this then they were in the original show. Yep this movie has everything the Power Rangers should have. Plenty of action, adventure, laughs and pure of heart. 10 out of 10 for this.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","rockman182","13 June 2017","I still remember watching Fox Five as a kid and for the first time seeing the series premiere of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. I was amazed as a five year old seeing this show and instantly got hooked. The first Power Rangers movie was a film that definitely defined my childhood. It was instantly quotable and campy fun. When I heard about this film I had zero hopes. I haven't kept up with the show beyond the first two or three seasons as a kid and expected a reboot for the film and franchise to be a failing venture. I was actually surprised that this film was actually entertaining. There were many problems with it but I think the origin story was done quite well.The film follows five teenagers who band together one night and discover mysterious power coins at an old mining site. They soon discover these coins are responsible for giving them superhero powers. They soon discover an ancient alien spaceship where they are grouped by Zordon to become the Power Rangers and stop an ancient Green Ranger who turned rogue named Rita Repulsa. Rita is trying destroy the planet and is in search for a crystal that will do so. She's also harboring the towns gold to create a giant gold monster named Goldar.First off, the film took some liberties with the characters. Rita is now a former ranger who lost their way and Goldar is a gigantic and destructive creature (rather than the buffoon follower of Rita in the series). We also learn much about Zordon's origins. The rangers also are more socially updated. One of the rangers is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, and another ranger is a lesbian. They also shifted things around (finally changed the Black Ranger being Black!) None of this was problematic and was actually fairly entertaining.The film does suffer from too much inactivity where the characters try to bond together and find themselves to morph into their armored ranger selves. The main battle also is a bit disappointing as I felt it was a little too anti-climactic. Still, This exceeded my very low expectations. I don't see a sequel coming despite the film setting up for it, the film was a major box office disappointment. Oh yeah, look out for some special cameos.6.5/10","6/10"
"Power Rangers","LloydBayer","22 March 2017","You know Hollywood is running out of ideas when a hallmark TV series is made into a big screen production, and then recycled and redecorated with a bigger budget for a new generation. That's perfectly acceptable with franchises like the Jurassic Park films, where sequels are released every decade or so and aimed at a specific cluster of the audience. Power Rangers, on the other hand, has no idea who its target audience is and here's probably why: a suit from Lionsgate (yes, Lionsgate) green- lit the reboot even as the TV series is still being aired, hired screenwriters who wrote superhero films like X-Men: First Class and producers from the Transformers franchise, then hired unknown actors and a newbie director before ending up with a PG-13 fiasco that's neither here nor there. At just over 120 minutes, it's highly unlikely this film will grab and hold the attention of children, whereas anyone over 40 expecting a glorious heist or scandalous bachelor party is in for the wrong film. This leaves us with older teens widely known as the YA crowd (young adults). Now here's the caveat: Back in the early '90s, superheroes films were limited to one-off appearances a year. 25 years later and there are no less than five superhero films a year (this year we have six including one animation) from stalwart studios with an ever increasing budget and fan base. Yet as a superhero origins film, the new Power Rangers film simply doesn't stack up to the expectations of the general audience, let alone teenagers who expect nothing but cutting edge effects in a mega bucks franchise. So while lacking a target audience, the bigger question is why a reboot after more than 20 years? Cashing in on the current superhero culture seems like an obvious motive, but the disparity in production quality is even more obvious from the opening scene right through to the end. Except for some campy moments from Elizabeth Banks as a gold digging alien witch (How's Rita Repulsa for camp?) there is no other character worth caring about, not even the titular high school misfits who discover extraordinary abilities but are too dumb to figure out their purpose as a team of intergalactic warriors. Sadly, Power Rangers turns out to be a cinematic misfire that should have gone straight to TV. But even then, titles from Netflix and Amazon Studios far outweigh this debacle whose only purpose appears to be a disappearing act in your wallet.","4/10"
"Power Rangers","phanthinga","25 March 2017","Back in the late 90s when im just a small boy the biggest piece of entertainment for kids in my country is the Power Rangers series and later on is the Super Sentai series the original root from Japan.I still remember how thrill and exciting i was when coming home and immediately turn on the TV to catch the latest episode then re watch it the next day waiting for the new episode to come out.Because i watch the both the series back to back so my memories with them is very strong and it still follow me to my teenage years.When i first hear the news that they gonna make a live-action Power Rangers movie some part of me just turn into a child again but it also make me very nervous because i know if their want to deliver a Power Rangers movie that not only give the old fan a trip down to memories lane but also make more new fan is not to taken this movie seriously and keep all the part that make what Power Rangers is today.For my surprise after watching this movie today im very please to say that they has did a great job with this one.Apart from the main storyline we already know is Power Rangers is about a group of teenager being chosen to hold a strong power help them turn into a kind of superheroes that each has a different color and each one of them has to working together as a team to save the earth from the force of evil.The thing that make this movie so much better than the movie came out in 1995 is how much good the characters being told in this movie.They all have their own problem with school and life so when we see their come together and exposed themselves it very great and heart warming at the time,i don't know what you guys think but the krispy kreme thing is hilarious.Other important characters is also portray very well but the best for me is Zordon voice by Bryan Cranston and Rita Repulsa played by Elizabeth Banks.Both of them did a fantastic job on portray how over the top and chessy their characters is although they did change some aspect of the Rita character but it not annoy me much so i kinda pass on that.The big problem with this movie is how before the epic climax the movie already a good teenage drama but all of that get blow away when they first morph into the suit and fight Rita.I find the last big action scene rather tame and a little bit letdown when the first fight with megazord is not only very unsatisfied but also very frustrated because for some reason they decide to turn Goldar a very beloved bad guy of the original series into a big crappy CGI monster literally make from gold.Still recommend this movie to everyone but don't bring high hope to this","7/10"
"Power Rangers","hlazox","27 March 2017","From a power rangers point of view, I think this movie was a 10 on 10. People who are interested in watching this movie, must go into the cinema with the right expectations.Please don't expect this power rangers movie to be as deep, as a movie like 'the dark knight', 'batman v superman' or 'shawshank redemption'. Historically speaking, power rangers had a corny production vibe to it, especially visually and this is one of the reasons kids fell in love with it. Kids at a young age, aren't as could as they are when they get older at interpreting deep philosophical messages; which is why power rangers in general isn't the type of show/movie you watch, expecting to leave the theater with a huge epiphany about life.I'd class this movie as overall fun and entertaining to watch. What I loved about it is the was never a scene whereby I felt bored. Though let me not exaggerate things and make you feel like every scene has got action in it, which is obviously not true. The point is the movie manages to keep an audience who walks into it with the right expectations, actively engaged in it.The were moral lessons one can learn by watching the movie. Issues like how to work as a team, how to be a leader, human mortality, opening yourself up emotionally to your friends, resisting conforming to societal expectations and having an open mindset.A few downsides to this movie were the graphics kind of looked cheap -- as in the visual effects weren't as real-like, like a movie like star wars the force awakens in my opinion. The villain came off as corny and audiences who like serious movies, probably won't like this movie. Though keep in mind -- the cheap looking graphics, corny villain and sometimes lack of seriousness in this movie is what makes power rangers the franchise it is today.So don't go into the theater expecting a movie with extremely deep philosophical points, that tells us humans are ultimately self-serving individuals etc.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","donbarredorapc","13 June 2017","Before reading there may be small spoiler ...I was a fan of the series for years, and I still find the best the first generation, for this movie I was very anxious, and now that I saw it, I can say that I do not exceed my expectations, the action scenes a bit slow, very Melosa the movie at times, and frankly hoped a bit more cliché, but in short you have to talk about the good thing now, the soundtrack pretty good, in fact the listen although for a few seconds that classic electric guitar of the 90 I get excited , Effects and designs of suits and zord very good except for the megazord, and it is necessary to emphasize something, that is the suspense, they play with the fan that knows by memory that will happen but they play with it when, despite everything a promising start I hope there is A sequel since there were things pending, here is a diamond in the rough, maybe with a better creative team can get a good saga, maybe it will not be at the level of matrix, godfather, Lord of the rings, but if you can Be better than the saga of Transformers and harry potter.traslated from Spanish with google","7/10"
"Power Rangers","stemelia21","24 February 2020","Right ok its not the best film ever made but it wasn't the worst either. However it's a film about the power rangers! How good is it going to be.The nostalgic fun was awesome. I used to watch the power rangers back in the early 90s when I was about 9 years old, it was the best thing ever. If I was that age now I'd be giving it a 10/10. A pretty good casting and they hit all the right spots with the action. Still dont understand why the blue ranger drowned in 20 seconds but other than that things made sense and there was lot of comparisons to the original. They included the original ""go go power rangers"" song which was awesome. I would be lying if I said I didnt get a little bit excited about the mega Zord.Give it 6/10. I was going to be 5/10 but the mega Zord and the original theme song pushed the score up a bit. Give it a watch it ain't bad and at the very worst it'll transport you back to your childhood for a couple of hours .","6/10"

"Power Rangers","ActionMovieDude","22 March 2017","Before I review the film, lets go back to the beginning of the awful television show.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers started airing on Fox Kids. Its true genesis was as an Americanized version of a long running Japanese kids show called Super Sentai which premiered back in 1975.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (with its bad 1990s haircuts, fashion, and earrings) merged original Japanese footage from two Super Sentai shows called Zyuranger and Dairanger with absolutely horrid American footage that was a bad Saved By The Bell knock off which eventually joined Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as the latest craze on Fox Kids. The third season, which ripped off Kakuranger, had the power rangers turned into children and replaced by ""ninja"" aliens. (Are you kidding me?!)Fast forward to 2017. Power Rangers has lost most of its former popularity, so greedy plagiarist Haim Saban decides to reboot ""his"" power rangers (which was never ""his"" in the first place, it belonged to Toei who originally created Super Sentai/power rangers) the same way Ninja Turtles was ""rebooted"" for the big screen a couple of years ago.This time, the new cast is completely dysfunctional and the first 90 minutes are a real DRAG ripping off other teen angst movies so much that many kids will undoubtedly find it BORING. (Which they did in my screening!) Its far more Chronicle/Fant4stic than power rangers.Elizabeth Banks is the only one doing decent work as the new Rita Repulsa, a former Power Ranger looking to revive her giant monster Goldar. Even Bryan Cranston is miscast and looks lost here as Zordon!The ending does finally bring the audience its goofy power rangers (in the last ten minutes!) with even more ridiculous plastic costumes than the cheesy Zyuranger spandex on the old show and bargain basement, combining video game CGI visual effects for the end battle which really DOES looks like another Playstation 2 game.The word CHEESE cannot describe how eye rolling and preposterous the ending is. (A megazord slap into outer space PUL-EEZZE)!Not to mention the endless Krispy Kreme references/placements are downright embarrassing.Do the world a favor watch a far superior comic book movie like Logan instead and save your money!Power rangers was a HUGE disappointment, its poor box office worldwide proves it.

"Power Rangers","devildog-80597","13 June 2017","OK, so this movie has a pretty good rating but it's even better if you take the time to read the reviews and see that the majority of the negative reviews are from 90's kids who are fans of their PR and honestly think the poor effects, bad writing and horrible acting from the 90's was good, not just for the 90s but for now. They are only upset because it makes their PRs look bad. And all of the other bad reviews are from religious nuts who don't like the very subtle reference that might mean the Yellow Power Ranger may be questioning her sexuality. Not once did they say it but the reviews would have you believe animals are having sex, kids are doing drugs and gay porn is taking place throughout the film, which it isn't. I'd wager that most of the negative reviews never saw the movie. This movie was good with special effects, background story, acting and more. It wasn't Oscar worthy, don't get me wrong but it was fun, action, sci-fi movie. If you like the original Power Rangers and think they are the best then don't watch this. If you want a fun and exciting movie to watch then definitely load this up.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","Wizard-8","29 September 2018","I will give this cinematic adaptation of the popular 90s kids television show this: it is somewhat less annoyingly juvenile in tone as the television show. And the young actors who play the title characters show likability and talent. However, even their charm and efforts can't save the movie in the end, for the reasons I stated in the subject line of this user comment.Let me explain. As I said, I found the movie too slow. If you are expecting a lot of Power Ranger action, you'll be very disappointed. The build-up to when the rangers get into action takes forever, about 3/4 of the running time. And when the rangers DO get into action, the mayhem feels slower, clunkier, and more awkward than the action on the television show.Strangely, the movie is also way too fast at times. There are a ton of plot points that are not defined clearly, or are forgotten about and never brought up again. Also, the villain of the movie (Rita Repulsa) is given almost no development at all, making her a really weak and colorless figure. There are signs that despite the length of this movie (124 minutes), a LOT of footage that might have fleshed out the story and characters was ultimately cut out in the editing room.Adults who liked the Power Rangers as kids will probably be let down by this movie. Kids might like the movie better, but will probably outgrow it when exposed to better movie later. I say for either age group, stick to reruns of the television show.","3/10"
"Power Rangers","larry-degala","10 May 2017","If Saban is going to spend $100 million on ""Power Rangers"", why did Dean Israelite only make $135 million back in the box office? ""Transformers"" made $708 million in 2007. The producers had a strong film budget, so what could possibly go wrong? Watch the midpoint on ""Transformers"" and the midpoint on ""Power Rangers."" I won't spoil it for you. You might get a good hint. Josh Trank of ""Chronicle"" could have done a better job. He made $168 million over his $126 million tent pole ""Fantastic Four"" in 2015. At least he made $42 million over the measly $35 million. Granted that Josh Trank and Dean Israelite are not Michael Bay, Joseph Kahn (another Generation X-er) made a superior version that was mature and well-developed, with chemistry and heart, and a intertwined story line that pulled the audience in, wanting for more. It had action like ""The Matrix"" with gritty drama like SyFy's ""Battlestar Galactica"". I felt his version moved the franchise forward from the small screen to the big. However, the trend is to hire Millennial filmmakers over Generation X filmmakers for budgets over $100 million because (and I quote) ""Millennials can only relate to Millennials."" Really? I mean REALLY? Forgot about Good Story-telling? Hello??!! It is not about one generation relating to another generation. Alfred Hitchcock even kicks butt in the post Millennial era. And so another franchise died as quickly as ""The Last Airbender."" Saban, try again please. Take my Alexander Hamiltons from these dying hands!","3/10"
"Power Rangers","Nintendo600","24 March 2017","Power Rangers was an easy 2 hours of my life and $22.95 ill never get back. Origin stories tend to be good, and also sometimes not so good. This one falls into the latter, with a solid 75% of the film setting up the final 20 minutes of the film and leaving the main villain who is very two-dimensional (not to mention Elizabeth Banks' terrible, terrible fake accent, sorry). With bad narrative, an unfinished and poorly written script/dialogue, there really isn't to go off.Some characters and series' are very outdated, (Superman, Green Lantern, majority of DC and their cartoon costumes that were bad enough in the 40's) unfortunately, Power Rangers is just one that belongs and needs to stay buried in the 90's. Seeing those costumes and hearing ""its morphin' time"" in the mid to late 2010's just sounds awfully outdated. PW has had its time, hopefully Lionsgate will be more smarter not to continue this franchise and ruin the memory many of us millennials had of the suited heroes.","3/10"
"Power Rangers","jackwarner999","21 March 2017","I was one of the first people to be asked to watch power rangers in December of 2016. I went into the theater not expecting much from this movie but I was wrong, it was a good movie. Not great or OK it was simply good. It had great CGI and the acting was good for a young cast. I loved the first 2 acts of the movie they were really strong and had good story telling. But act 3 in my opinion seemed silly and sort of rushed. The first 2 acts were great because of 2 things. Great characters and a steady pace. The character development was great and I liked how the writers really stuck to making them interesting so that the audience would care about them, especially RJ Cylers character. Nothing was rushed and was going at a great pace and then all of a sudden act 3 came into play and it turned into a mediocre action film and wasn't very exciting and I believe that is due to the villain. I was not a fan. Her motives are too over used and simply a lame character. The actress was fine but the character it'self wasn't anything special and made the action scenes dull. Other than that the kids will love it and if you are a power ranger fan I think you will be pleased. It's fun for the whole family.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","kosmasp","26 July 2017","The actors themselves may not be in their teenage years anymore, but the characters they are portraying are. This is as Popcorn and light as it gets. We have Bryan Cranston as a sort of mentor figure to our lead group. And that group is of course unwilling at first. I have to admit here, that I have not seen previous installments of the Power Rangers, so I can't really compare. Even cameos from previous Power Rangers would have gone over my head, if they hadn't been pointed out to me.So there is stuff to look forward to, but it all is very easy going. It's predictable as expected, the CGI gets better every year and it's good in this one, although there's always room for improvement. Watch it, just don't expect too much","6/10"
"Power Rangers","mizavila","9 July 2017","Apparently none of you remember the original series or the reboot shows following being just as ""cheesy"" as some of you say. I'm a 80s baby that grew up watching this show and now have babies of my own who watch the ""Original"" power rangers as well as the reboot shows. All of these shows have that cheesy feel to it but it's what made us all love it and still do. You all are just hating so bad on this movie because these kids don't fit your expectations of what a power ranger should be from the beginning. The directors are trying to tell a different story, yes in the beginning these kids did some bad things & made bad choices. But they start to realize what it is become a true power ranger. Who go from selfish teenage misfits to teenage kids who care about the world and saving their home and the planet. And the sexuality you all are crying about don't remember the original movie where Kimberly practically threw herself at Jason every chance she got & then there was Dulcea who was an almost half naked woman. Yet I see no one pointy that out. Oh that's right its because this is 2017 & a little sexual jokes is like someone just walked around fully naked down the road. So those that ""followed"" the show from the beginning as well as the remakes, should be maybe re watch those movies and shows & realize that this movie is not as bad as you all make it seem.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","megadethdragoncrimson","24 March 2017","A morphenomenal reimaging of a classic franchise. A crossblend of Chronicle meets The Breakfast Club but surprisingly it works! The character development was a real surprise since in the original Power Rangers series, that didn't exactly exist. There's a good blend of cheesiness that fans that watched MMPR grew up with as well as solid storytelling to make for a great time. If you go into this expecting for a purist Xerox of what you watched growing up, you'll be disappointed. But if you go into this with an open mind looking to have a fun time, you won't be disappointed. I was very impressed with the overall performances of the entire cast especially Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa and RJ Cyler as Billy. Fans of the franchise and even those who didn't bother to care for it before should watch this. It's a very fun film that makes you feel like a kid again.

"Power Rangers","nargon","28 April 2023","I think Power Rangers fans went into this film with the wrong expectations of what it would be, and were therefore dissapointed. If all you want is the 1995 film with a bigger budget, you will not get it here. What you will get is a thoughtful, patient look at the lives and troubles of five young people who learn not only the value, but also the nessesity of finding meaningful human connection, and the beauty of true friendship. Because in this movie, these are actual teenagers with actual attitude. After we've done that, it's 20 minutes of great looking heart pounding action the likes of which the show could never achieve. It, unlike most movies today, does not use nostalgia as a crutch, rather it dares to try something new and unique, keeping the heart of its source material, if not always the look. A sequel could have given us more morphed action, introduced a fan favorite character, and continued more in the vein of that the original show. Sadly, if Ranger Nation continues to be upset because the film dared to give the infallible TV show characters some flaws and depth, we may never see Power Rangers rise to it's full potential.","9/10"
"Power Rangers","Pjtaylor-96-138044","12 March 2020","This gritty reboot of 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (1993-1999)' has a bit of a tonal problem. 'Power Rangers (2017)' can't decide if it wants to be a dulled-down, hard-edged action movie or a bright, tongue-in-cheek throwback piece. This is disconcerting, to say the least. I mean, the picture has both a 'Transformers (2007)'-esque, teamwork-focused ending and a subplot about the non-consensual sharing of a teenager's 'nude pics' (perpetrated by a hero, no less). There are jokes about space robots, super powers and accidentally 'pulling off' a bull, scenes centred around outlandish stunts, combat training and the murder of innocent civilians, and references to pop-culture, power rangers and the bullying of an autistic child. I think you get the point. It's just so all over the place, at once deadly serious and incredibly silly, and it doesn't always seem to know which 'mode' it's currently in. On the positive side, the focal team is comprised of a diverse set of decently developed characters; no-one is left out due to race, gender, sexuality, disability or personal baggage. The finale is also surprisingly effective, especially - I suppose - for a big CG-based battle. It's not great but it's entertaining enough. I'll also add that Banks' Rita Repulsa feels like she's walked straight out of the 90s show. It's just a shame that only a few oblique callbacks follow her. For most of the movie, I was honestly cringing. It's generic, banal and forced, bland in the blandest of ways. Don't get me wrong, it's basically passable. I just don't know who it's for, really. It's too grown-up for kids but too flawed for adults. Its best bit is when the teens finally come together, draped in their technicolor armour, and deliver the colourful kung-fu cheesiness that most people expect with the brand. Unfortunately, this only lasts for about two minutes. 5/10","5/10"

"Power Rangers","davijieienne","3 January 2022","Every single thing that happens in this movie is an insult to the very spirit of the original TV series.The characters DO NOT form any real bond between themselves in their ""common"" life. They never become real friends, let alone work as a squad, they just try and fail at it.And about the ""Power"" side, there's nothing to differentiate the various colors, the Rangers have no personal weapons or special abilities to define them.None of them does anything cool, througout the movie, they're not good at fighting, thinking, or even driving their Zords, and when it comes to the Megazord, it looks like some crappy Transformer, with no resemblance with the Zords that should be his parts, and, guess what, it has no special weapon or special attack AT ALL! (So they win for no apparent reason)Zordon seems like a selfish, disturbed AI like Hal 9000 (from 2001 A Space Odissey) which the Rangers can't trust, and Alpha is up to no good either
Very frustrating and disappointing, I feel the need to watch some episode from the latest TV series to
cheer me up.","1/10"
"Power Rangers","BrBaFett","24 March 2017","I grew up a die-hard Power Ranger fan. I thought at first it was cheezy with the story behind the Power Rangers, Zordon once the Red Ranger and the fictional language that was being spoken. Liked the idea of detention, but I feel they could've done better introducing the Rangers before hand. Wasn't high on the casting choices either; my favourite was RJ Cyler as Billy because I think he portrayed it so well, liked the version of Trini, but still think casting could've been better. Didn't like the version of Rita Repulsa because in the show Rita is a witch with a team of villains, but all she has from them in this movie is-- literally--GOLDar... which is probably what else made me mad. Alpha, I could live with, kinda liked that version. But still wish they had the actual Command Center as a headquarters. Like Bryan Cranston as Zordon was awesome. But later towards the end is where I started to tear up. I liked their morphing sequence--that was my favourite part of the entire show. Then after seeing the zords was just unbelievably awesome while playing the Power Rangers theme song. If you watch the show, you'll understand these 100%. I liked how they had all the Power Ranger cameos, such as Jason's dad saying, 'Mariner Bay and Reefside.' Old ficitonal cities from the TV show in other seasons: my jaw dropped. The fight scenes with the zords and Goldar were so well done, just would've rather seen a megazord transformation and although was impressed with the morphing sequence, I wish they did it better. I cried towards the end when I saw (Jason David Frank and Amy Jo Johnson) Tommy and Kimberly's cameo, then seeing after the credits hearing the name 'Tommy Oliver,' my mind officially went super positive. Overall I loved it, even though there were some things that bother me. But this is a valuable review because I am a die-hard Power Rangers fan. Take my word for it.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","Justin_Shanahan","25 March 2017","Yes, it is very different from the original but bares some similarities. I didn't like the zords that much, only because they look extremely different. I couldn't tell if the black ranger was driving a mastodon, or some unknown creature zord. The zords were hard to recognize. I like that it is all modern, but at least make the zords recognizable and the suits. Don't get me wrong, the suits were nice, and I did like them a lot, but I wish they were more recognizable. I thought Elizabeth Banks did a great job. She did play a villain role well and I'd like to see more of that. Although, I was disappointed that she was in green clothing. She is bringing Rita to a new level and that is good. At least she had Goldar with her. He was updated, nothing wrong with that but at least have him talk and have a face. The putties were good, again, you couldn't tell what they were. What I am trying to say is that changes are always good, and I am all for it, but if you're going to update a character or zords for that matter, at least make it recognizable. Like the Mighty Morphen Power Ranger Movie back in the 90's were updated but recognizable. It really does suck that her goons weren't in the movie and speaking of goons, I'm sad that they didn't have Bulk and Skull. Just like Rita and Goldar, they will always be apart of the Power Ranger universe. It just wasn't the same without them. Alpha's voice should of stood the same, seeing as he was Alpha 5. Again, there was a lot of changes to the film vs The Original.The sound effects were good. The music was good. I hope to see more of the morphin sequences and Zords transforming into the Megazord. Overall, this film is good and I am gonna watch it again.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","The_Baba","9 April 2017","Based on the exciting big robot/superhero series for kids, this reboot has nothing in common with the colorful TV show besides its name. Washed out are all of the things that made kids gravitate towards Power Rangers leaving behind a hollow product that bares its name. In place of all of the things that gave Power Rangers its distinction, costume designs, set pieces, music and intense action is now generic fluff and bland characters. No kid who sees this for the first time is gonna fall in love with it like they did the original show.They blew it. They had the opportunity to make something that could stand on its own against big robot movies like The Transformers or superhero ensembles like The Avengers but now won't even be noticed alongside these movies. And while to this day people will remember Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, they have already forgotten about this movie when leaving the theater.Do yourselves a favour, instead of watching this, Youtube ''Megazord Dragonzord team up'' and see something really cool.P.S.

"Power Rangers","cruise01","25 March 2017","A group of five troubled high school students discovering some power coins turning them into Power Rangers. I have never seen the original TV series and vaguely remember seeing the 1995 movie which was cool for its time but cheesy now and looking like a very low budget version of an nickelodeon movie. Dean Israelite film on this Power Rangers adaptation is a lot of fun seeing these students get together from their troubled past and form a team. The modern take is a blockbuster fun type of film that follows the cliché origin story and have a better looking armor suits with the rangers, some cheesy humor, and visual effects. Like most origin stories, the plot follows these five high school students who all cross paths in detention. Jason (Dacre Montgomery) a high school football player that got into a wreck after a prank gone bad. Billy (RJ Cyler) a smart awkward student in trouble for blowing up a locker. Kimberly (Naomi Scott) who got into trouble for punching the ex boyfriend. They all run into each other in the mountains, including Trini (Becky G) who is having trouble fitting in, and Zack (Ludi Lin) a teen that is arrogant but also has a soft side taking care of his sick mother in a trailer park. They all discover these alien coins that gives them superhuman strength and abilities. Making them Power Rangers. As a threat nears when Rita (Elizabeth Banks) is preparing to summon her army to unleash a weapon that can wipe everyone on Earth. Even though the film does follow the origin formula. It is a lot of fun seeing these five teens trying to coop on what has been holding them back and seeing them cooperate with the other. Even in the second act, when they are all at a campfire, sharing there troubled past. Also, seeing these five characters learning from Zordon (Bryan Cranston) who was once the leader of his team of power rangers. These characters learn what they have to become. You get to see these characters become the power rangers and morph into their armor a little late in the movie like the last half hour as they fight against Rita's army. It is great to see these characters develop in the movie, which is a lot of fun. The action sequence was fun. Seeing the power rangers operating their own Zords (robotic vehicles). And a battle with Goldar (a giant golden monster) and the Megazord that the rangers morphed into. The action picks up in the climax with destruction and fighting. The visual effects were nothing to brag about which was okay. The humor was cheesy when it came to dialogue or a plot device that centered it at a krispy kreme building. Even, seeing Rita waiting at the donut shop and eating a donut during the climax. Yet again, Power Rangers is supposed to be family fun. I love the cast talent that I would hope to see these actors grow further into their characters in sequels.Overall, Power Rangers is a lot of fun; it has character development, exciting action sequences, great cast, and cheesy humor, which you can expect, in this type of film. I would rate Power Rangers 4 out of 5 stars.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","TheJediWay9","23 March 2017","""Power Rangers: The No-One-Gives-A-S#!t Edition"" is directed by Dean Isrealite on a screenplay from John Gatins, Mark Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Kieran & Michelle Mulroney and focuses on a group of teenagers who are screw ups. They are outcasts in their school and society until they stumble upon these power coins and a spaceship and its there that they learn they are a new generation of Power Rangers.I was born in 1994 and was quite familiar with the Power Rangers when I was a kid. Whenever they were on TV, these were the superheroes my brother and I looked up to. Watching the god-awful but somehow hilariously bad ""Might Morphin Power Rangers"" movie from 1997 where every time they kick a monster into a wall it explodes into purple goo (no joke) from a very young age somehow told me that I wanted to be a Power Ranger. then I grew up, the Power Rangers weren't popular anymore, and now I am in college.Enter 2017, where studios try to make everything a ""thing"" now, and that is the case with this movie. I had a slimmer of hope that this movie would be good. And if it wasn't good, I was hoping it would at least be enjoyable in that fun, cheesy, goofy, entertaining type way that the show was back in the 90s.I'm not gonna lie: for the first two-thirds of this movie, I found what I was watching fairly enjoyable. Was it ground-breaking? No. It seemed like they were going to finally get a Power Rangers movie right for the first time. I was supporting these characters the whole way. There's a scene in the middle of the movie where they have a heart-to-heart with one another, and that scene actually provided some nice character depth and backstory for those characters whose backstory was completely glossed over at the beginning of the film. All of the actors playing the Power Rangers were also really good. Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Dacre Montgomery, Becky G, and Ludi Line. all five of them did a good job in their roles. The movie really hinged on them and if they ended up sucking, this movie would have been a complete failure.Elizabeth Banks was just a cartoon copy of herself. She was so over the top in such a serious movie that both her plan and her character became stupid after awhile. She was a definition of a cliché villain, showing up only to pose a threat and not really do much and then be at the center of the final throw down. Bryan Cranston as Zordon... pretty good actually.Aside from Elizabeth Banks, everything leading up to the climatic showdown was actually pretty enjoyable. Watching the Power Rangers train was actually pretty cool, and seeing them stumble upon their Zords for the first time was quite the site. But then the third act happened, and it completely derailed the movie. Everything leading up to the point at the beginning of the third act where a Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became a plot device was fairly good. Once this plot device is introduced, that and everything after it is a complete waste of time. It's all bad. There's nothing good about the third act of this movie. Sure you have the Power Rangers kicking ass, that's what we all wanted to see, but it looked really sloppy. This movie fell into the habit of having its action scenes filmed in what I like to call ""Slow-Fast-Mo,"" which is a style that was cool ten years ago for one movie then everyone started doing it and it began to suck. Things in this third act happen that don't make any sense. How are they flying their Zords if they haven't flown them before? The special effects are really terrible. The CGI looked like it came from a Playstation 2 game's cut scenes, and of course there's a giant monster....that they have to fight...and it's gold... and gigantic. There was nothing exciting about this fight. I didn't care about this small town and whether or not it got destroyed. It's in the middle of frigging nowhere. It's strange to think that this movie is fairly enjoyable for the first two acts and makes you believe that you are watching a good movie. Once that third act pops up though, it really just becomes what the TV show was. Bad. But unlike the TV show and the 1997 movie, this was bad in bad way.I am going to give ""Power Rangers"" a 4.2/10.Check out my video review of ""Power Rangers"" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=ckFQeFdsIv0&t=25s","4/10"

"Power Rangers","quincytheodore","22 March 2017","Join five teenagers as they embark on overly complex origin story, staggering change in directional tone, intense product placement and awkward usage of nostalgia. The hectic mess is not without its charm, the team is, at the very least, likable with more personality than transforming robot movies in recent time had, though it's not a high achievement. The best thing one could say about this reboot is it could've been so much worse.Origin story isn't the most novel idea, but it has become a necessity as of late, especially for a reboot. The Rangers undergo a series of exposition, mainly taking serious direction from other superhero themed movie Chronicle, but also translating the corny style from its original television show. It tells both the story of apocalypse and also abundance of jokes, and then it veers into the realm of heavy personal issues.The sudden shift is felt so many times that the movie feels like a robot piloted by several people. However, it's not without charm or humor. The cast might feel bizarrely put together at fight, but they do have their moments. This provides a little bit of bravado and less vanilla than the original show. If anything, they are limited only by the fantasy troupes which may seem predictable or campy, then again this is Power Rangers, not Logan.It has one edge over other superhero movies; the product placement. The trend has been done for years, but Power Rangers take it to the next level. For action, humanoid and robotic, it mostly stays true to the original source, including poses and jingles. This does feel like an afternoon show with the ad and spark of nostalgia.Many have complained that superhero movies are too gritty or too corny, Power Rangers is both, often at the same time. This is clearly not an advantage as it would have fared much better sticking to the light humor or heavy personal struggle. Still, for a movie based on 90s children show, it offers mild indulgent and barely avoids being a total disaster.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","DBLurker","29 June 2017","Instead of creating any new unique characters, they went for same old PC garbage with generic character templates. Not a single interesting Power Ranger but I guess for Hollywood, being ""lesbian"" or gay these days is interesting enough. The actors are god-awful, especially the Chinese guy.The fact is, we used to watch the show as kids because of creatures and fighting, not because of generic Power Rangers (PRs) as normal humans since they had a personality of a potato. You'd think that a movie focusing so much on normal PRs would come up with better characters than generic troubled teens with autism and lesbianism as their special power (when no in suits).The worse part is that the action is so.. boring. The creatures they fight are so awful that most of the time you don't even care that the creatures exist (funny enough, creatures have same level of personality as the PRs). Then there is the terrible Goldan special effect and hilariously awful Rita. In shows, Rita was just crazy fun, overacted and funny. Here? She's trying to be serious and all sinister and it's just so cringe-worthy seeing the actress trying to act that way.Coming back to special effects. They are just terrible. Robots look like they are made of plastic, Goldan looks like terrible pre-rendered CGI from those old PS2 CGI before the games. Everything looks so fake and considering how fake the PRs shows looked, this is just amazing. At least in shows you can suspend disbelief knowing the limitation of a budget.. here? They spent $100 million dollars on this garbage CGI with robots that look like plastic toys.Anyway, there is going to be a sequel apparently. Maybe they'll spend time more on action than ""OMG I AM LESBIAN MY PARENTS DON'T UNDERS-HI I AM AUTISTIC!"".","1/10"
"Power Rangers","TheLastPersonStanding","23 March 2017","When I was a kid, I was into ""Power Rangers"", like probably many other kids in the '90s. I eventually lost interest in it, though. I only saw this film because a friend emailed me free passes to an advanced screening. Many people in the audience seemed to be enjoying it. There was laughing, cheering, and applauding, which is fine, but I simply wasn't one of those people. I don't think I laughed once while watching the film. It's not really boring, but it's not really engaging. The two scenes I enjoyed the most are when the villain Rita is in a jewellery store being weird and the big fight scene with Rita's giant gold monster, which is, of course, near the end.What's the story? Well, I don't feel like writing about the story because I don't care... but I'll write about it, anyway. A bunch of teenagers discover a spaceship or something hidden underground. Inside is Alpha 5, a comical robot who looks kinda like an alien, and Zordon, who appears as a big pixelated face... at least I think it's pixelated. The teenagers have superpowers and have to morph into Power Rangers so they can stop Rita from taking over the world or some crap. It takes awhile until they're all able to morph and you don't see them in their Power Ranger costumes a lot. The Rangers each have their own giant robot creature that they can control while they're inside of them. These creatures are used for the big fight scene and when combined, they become an even bigger robot that's reminiscent of a Michael Bay Transformer. Do the Rangers defeat Rita and her giant gold monster? Duh.The effects are pretty good and the acting is OK, but like I wrote earlier, I didn't care about the story. I also didn't care about the characters. None of them are interesting. Krispy Kreme is involved with the plot, by the way. To me, it's superfluous product placement. I don't know if you'll enjoy this film if you're a Power Rangers fan. It only made me want to rewatch the short film ""Power/Rangers"".","7/10"
"Power Rangers","zkonedog","25 March 2017","""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" was the first television show I remember being totally mesmerized by. I was ""of the perfect age"" (8-10) when the show aired, and it was seemingly all- consuming in my life. So, when some 25 years later I heard that a new Power Rangers movie was hitting theaters, I knew I'd be front and center opening weekend (nostalgia is a powerful force). What I didn't know is if it would be any good, or if this remake would be butchered in any number of ways. Fortunately, ""Power Rangers"" was better than it really should have any right to have been.For a basic plot summary, ""Power Rangers"" tell the story of how a group of five ""teenagers with attitude""--Jason (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly (Naomi Scott), Billy (RJ Cyler), Zack (Ludi Lin), & Trini (Becky G.)--find five mysterious colored coins hidden in a rock quarry. The coins give each of them superhuman abilities, and they soon discover that they are humanities only hope in fighting up with the forces of evil, more specifically Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) and her plot to destroy Angel Grove and the world with it. On the side of the five Rangers are Zordon (Bryan Cranston) the disembodied sage, and his robot sidekick Alpha 5 (Bill Hader).Here's the thing that I think everyone should keep in mind when analyzing this movie: In order for it to truly be ""Power Rangers"", it has to appeal to kids just as much as myself (the nostalgia- fueled audience). This film does an excellent job of doing both of those things. While I'm usually rather annoyed at kids chattering in the theater, I can make an exception for this film, as it was fun to hear the little ones' reactions to the entire experience. I have a strong feeling that if you watch this film as a 7-10 year old today, you'll leave thinking it is ""the best movie you've ever seen"". This was ESSENTIAL in the success of the film.There are also quite a few ""easter eggs"" (lines, visuals, cameos, etc.) for the ""old nostalgics"" like myself. While I may never be able to quite experience that sheer joy of being 8-10 again and watching in complete wonder, I was at least able to recapture some of that glory this time around. The film hews pretty true to the original ""Mighty Morphin"" storyline, just adding a few little wrinkles here and there. It's fun seeing the five teens both in and out of the suits, Cranston is a great Zordon, and Banks is quite entertaining as well. It is quite clear that Haim Saban and his production crew took great care to make sure this one stayed true to the spirit of the original.Only helping matters is director Dean Israelite, who really impressed me by helming ""Project Almanac"", another teen-driven vehicle that turned into a very entertaining flick. Building a movie around teens can be tricky (many pitfalls and tropes to avoid), but Israelite really seems to have a handle on that craft.Now, is ""Power Rangers"" a bit cheesy and predictable/straightforward. Sure. ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" was the most cheesy and predictable show ever made! One has to just expect that going in. Even at the very top of its game, this material will never be given any major awards or anything like that. I think the thing that matters, though, is that this won't matter to kids at all, as they will be able to take the material completely at face value (much like I did at that age).Overall, then, I enjoyed the experience of re-living my youth and seeing ""Power Rangers"" up on the big screen once again! I saw the film with a younger sibling who knew little of the franchise, and she liked it just as much as me, so it really has to be doing something right in that regard. There is also almost unlimited potential for sequels spinning off from this effort, with something to that effect even teased in a post-credits scene. So, whether you are a 30-something looking to recapture a fleeting glimpse of youth or a kid being wowed by the Rangers for the first time, there will be something in this movie for you.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","niggor92","26 March 2017","I saw lots of reviews for this movie, I guess most of those people are real Power Rangers fans. And i still can't realize: WHAT THE **** DID YOU EXPECT?!This is a REBOOT. A completely new story, just like director said. This is the first movie in a new superhero franchise, and it needs to have a focus on the story and its characters, not on battles and morphing sequences. It's made for everybody except kids, because it's dark and much more serious than the TV show which was made mostly for kids. We have five teenagers and each of them has his own issues he needs to solve himself in order to become a hero (Power Ranger) and save the world. Every next situation in the movie makes our heroes closer to each other and stronger as a team.I personally enjoyed watching this movie because it is dark, amazing, emotional, funny(of course not that much like the TV show), and has AWESOME introduction to the whole story and its main characters. I can only imagine what's planned for the sequel. CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT!!! #GO #GO #POWER #RANGERS","7/10"
"Power Rangers","gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","14 April 2020","In Angel Grove, five teenagers stumble upon an alien ship and meet Zordon and Alpha, a holographic projector who was the former Red Ranger and a robot, who recruits them on a mission to save their world from an evil threat known as Rita Repulsa, the former Green Ranger. They must train and learn to overcome their real life issues in order to do so.After the underperformance of Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, plans for a reboot lasted for over a decade while Power Rangers would continue to receive multiple seasons. Later in 2017, the reboot got released in theaters on March 24 2017 to mixed reviews and became a box office flop due to it's competition against the Beauty and the Beast remake from Disney and Kong: Skull Island from Warner Bros, thus canceling a planned movie franchise.As a person who loves Power Rangers upon growing up watching the series, I felt really bad for this reboot. Yes, it does have problems and it's not a perfect film, but I thought it was fun and entertaining. Not only that, it does honor the history of Power Rangers to those who grew up with it.(Warning, this review does contain some bits of spoilers)The story does a really nice job in expanding on Power Rangers. There's a backstory to Zordon and Alpha and their connection to Rita Repulsa during their battle at the Cenozoic Era which is done very well in the beginning of the film. Also, the Power Rangers group including Jason, Kimberly, Billy, Trini, and Zack have been fleshed out as actual teenagers with attitudes when compared to the non-realistic goody good personalities of the original Mighty Morphin group (which isn't a bad thing mind you as it worked back at 1993, but it's understandable while many people who watched Power Rangers didn't like the Mighty Morphin group as time went by). And most importantly, Rita Repulsa's motivation in this reboot as to why being rejected her Green Ranger powers gives her a reason as to why she's evil and how she plans to conquer the world. Not to mention it references the Zeo Crystal became very relevant to the film's plot as it was supposed to set up future films which became very unlikely due to the film's failure at the box office.That being said, there some other things I liked about the film. The cinematography is very nice as is the look of the Command Center and Angel Grove, the darker tone is very welcomed while not without some bits of humor which for the most part is really hilarious. Also, the look of the Ranger designs is actually pretty good as it retains the same mouth pieces and animal-like helmets while fitting the tone nicely. Brian Tyler's score is riveting. It retains the same ""Go Go Power Rangers"" theme while giving itself it's own identity and gives the intense moments of the film some atmosphere. And last but not least the acting. Bryan Cranston (who voiced the two monsters of the week in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) does a great job as Zordon, Bill Hader is very funny and yet very poignant as Alpha 5, and Elizabeth Banks is great as she gives Rita Repulsa a sense of menace and complexity. The actors who played the Power Rangers also did a good job too. Dacre Montgomery (who would later play Billy Hargrove in Season 2 of Stranger Things), Naomi Scott (who would later play Jasmine in Disney's live action remake of Aladdin), RJ Cyler (who starred in the Scream tv series), Becky G (a singer and guest star from Austin & Ally), and Ludi Linn (from Marco Polo, Aquaman, Black Mirror and the upcoming Mortal Kombat reboot in 2021), shines in their chemistry and like Rita, they also give some complexity as they explain their real life issues with each other thus making them very believable.However, there are some problems that needs to be addressed. First, there's the CGI. Now, I've seen films that have handled the CGI way better, but in this reboot, they look pretty much off especially the look of Zordon and Alpha 5 despite the 100 million dollar budget of the film. Second, the rangers themselves don't morph until the third act of the film which is very disappointing considering the posters. And also, in the third act of the film, the location of the Zeo crystal that was revealed felt pretty dumb to me (go watch the rest of the film and you'll understand why).So, overall, the Power Rangers 2017 reboot isn't perfect and it could've been much stronger, but it's still a fun and entertaining film that respects and honors the history of Power Rangers. It's a shame we didn't get a planned movie franchise since there's another reboot in the works, though. So, to those who haven't seen the film, this might worth watching. :)","8/10"
"Power Rangers","blazedounal","26 June 2017","I was a fan of the series for years, and I still find the best the first generation, for this movie I was very anxious, and now that I saw it, I can say that I do not exceed my expectations. I only watched Power Rangers a little bit when was younger and was never really into it, but, I got to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I loved it, I think everyone involved did a very good job. There was a good mix of comedy, action, drama and even some sentimental moments.In the Cenozoic-era, six interplanetary warriors, the Power Rangers, are tasked with protecting life on Earth and the Zeo Crystal. The Green Ranger, Rita Repulsa, betrays them and plans to dominate the universe. Red Ranger orders Alpha 5 to perform a meteor strike that kills him and sends Rita to the bottom of the sea, foiling her scheme.In 21st century Angel Grove, high school football star Jason Scott is dismissed from the team and placed under house arrest after a failed prank. In school detention, he defends Billy from a bully, Billy offers to deactivate Jason's ankle monitor for help at an old gold mine that evening. Billy detonates explosives to break some rock, attracting the attention of Jason, Kimberly, and nearby students, Trini and Zack. The five discover the Power Coins and each take one. While escaping mine security, their car is hit by a train. The five find themselves at home the next morning and discover they have been granted superhuman abilities. Elsewhere, Rita's body is found. Waking, she goes on a rampage, hunting pieces of gold to raise her minion Goldar to find the Zeo Crystal. The five teenagers return to the mine and discover an ancient spaceship where they meet Alpha 5 and Zordon's consciousness. They inform the teenagers about the Rangers history and Rita, warning that they have eleven days until Rita has her full power, finds the Zeo Crystal, and uses it to destroy life on Earth. The five leave the ship with no intention of returning until Zordon pleads with Jason to convince the team.The five returned to train the next day, but they cannot morph. They spend the next week training against simulated Putties and trying unsuccessfully to morph. To inspire the Rangers, Alpha reveals the Zords. Zack takes his Zord out for a joyride and almost kills the other Rangers when he crashes it. This angers Jason, and they fight. While trying to separate the two, Billy spontaneously morphs. However, when he becomes conscious of it, the armor disappears. Angered at their lack of progress, Zordon dismisses the group. Jason returns to the ship to confront Zordon and discovers that once the Rangers morph, it will open the Morphing Grid and allow Zordon to restore himself in a physical body. Feeling betrayed, Jason accuses Zordon of using the team for his own benefit. The team camp at the mine and bond with each other.Later that night, Rita attacks Trini and orders her to bring the Rangers to the docks. Trini informs them about Rita and they arrive to fight, but are quickly defeated. Rita forces Billy to reveal the location of the Zeo Crystal, kills him, and releases the others. The Rangers take Billy's body to the ship and ask Zordon to resurrect him. The Rangers agree they would give their lives for each other and resolve to defeat Rita. In doing so, they unlock the Morphing Grid. Zordon revives Billy, sacrificing being able to restore his physical self. With the team restored and confident, the Rangers morph into their armor.Rita creates Goldar, raises an army of Putties, and attacks Angel Grove to find the Zeo Crystal. The Rangers battle the Putties and head to Angel Grove in their Zords. After the Rangers destroy the Putties, Goldar pushes the Rangers and their Zords into a fiery pit. In the pit, the Zords combine, forming the Megazord. Rita merges with Goldar. The Rangers battle and destroy Goldar. After refusing Jason's offer to surrender, a defiant Rita tells the Rangers that more will come for the crystal. In the end, Megazord slapped Rita into space. The Rangers are praised as local heroes, and with Rita's threats foiled, they return to their normal lives.","2/10"

"Power Rangers","jaysanchu07","3 December 2023","Dang, Dean Israelite had us fooled with Power Rangers' potential offerings. From its marketing stints, the film seemed poised to tap onto our childhood nostalgia with some old fashioned morphin time, with a promise of 21st century filmmaking elements that elevates. It is then a massive disappointment that this adaptation was a fiasco of teenage melodrama, that dragged on for most of its runtime. It is then easy to forget, that this was a superhero movie. Worse, its messages were confusing & never compelling, a waste of time & energy. When Israelite finally foregoes the cheese-fest & steps on the pedal, the action spectacle was frustratingly unworthy of the time consuming debacle. It was lame & claims NO PLACE within the genre's recent toe-to-toe bad assery. As for its superhero lineup, the Power Rangers were a mishmash of uninteresting characters that consists of the usual teenage tropes, weakened further by overused backstories, annoying mannerisms & serious lack of chemistry. Sadly, Rita Repulsa doesn't escape the atrocious dramatis personae writing, with her laughable spiels, generic motivations & lame-ass prowess.In case not clear, Power Rangers is a drama-thon bust that parades itself as an action-packed fanfare. Hollywood ruins yet another childhood memory.","9/10"
"Power Rangers","Sabre-El","25 September 2019","This is one of those cases which shows that movie ratings do not represent reality. To me, this movie offers so much given the type of movie it is meant to be. It's not meant to be serious, it's not meant to be dramatic. It's just meant to be a renewed version of the old TV series. And it delivers on that.The movie follows the protagonists' to becoming Power Rangers and almost two-thirds of the movie is dedicated to that. The pace during this time is quite good. Everything, from the graphics to the directing and acting (not so much, but it gets a pass as these aren't well-known actors) is top notch.The last third of the story is a bit rushed, but is still fulfilling. The villain's motivations are not so clear, and the same can be said about their powers. But this is Power Rangers; what do we even expect?All in all, a very decent modern take on the Power Rangers. One can see that the film-makers have tried their best to add as many throw-backs as they could. I'm not that big a fan of them, but I got to say that this actually ranks as one of the movies that I had fun watching this year. Will definitely recommend watching, esp. if you want to watch a family movie.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","bkrauser-81-311064","24 March 2017","Guess its time to whip out your old Tamagotchi and listen to whatever Marcy Playground song you've recorded on your Tiger Talkboy when you were six; because the nineties are back! Don't believe me, just check out the newest blockbuster film that's about to hit your multiplex with the force of a speeding Bronco. Yes the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers are back and this time instead of importing stock footage from some cheap Japanese superhero show, this brooding, edgier version is importing clichés from every American superhero film from the last fifteen years.Just how much edgier is this new movie? Well the story begins with three of the five soon-to-be Rangers spending their Saturdays in detention so already they're more irascible than Bulk and Skull. They're also about half as much fun as evidenced after our five teenagers with attitude meet up, discover their multi-colored power coins and proceed to stare at each other in confusion. This lasts an entire act and throughout we're only given the archetypal outlines of our heroes to play with. There's the bland Red leader (Montgomery), the Yellow outsider (G.), the Black bad boy (Lin) and the Pink Ranger (Scott) who seems to think cutting her hair on a whim doesn't make her the personification of mayonnaise.Then of course there's Billy (Cyler), the Blue Ranger. He's on the spectrum; you can tell because he outright says he's ""on the spectrum."" While this could have been a good moment to truly act upon the TV show's (1993-1995) phoned-in anti-bully, inclusion-based ""the more you know,"" pablum, the movie basically just uses him as a narrative building block. That's of course when they're not also using the Blue Ranger as a tonally embarrassing point of mirth for the sake of undermining the gritty tone. Considering that his autism is boiled down to a running joke, its a miracle RJ Cyler comes across as sincere as he does. Every time the ensemble tries to elevate him as the movie's heartfelt center, you really want to believe it's sincerity, even if it feels counterfeit.Its that faux sincerity and the nostalgia that will no doubt sell long-time fans on this new film. As much as the reboot wobbles between seriousness and silliness, the fact that there is an appearance of a center of mass, means that there's just enough here for audiences to trick themselves into thinking they saw the best version they possibly could have made. It makes a kind of sense; how can you really make a realistic movie about children gaining superpowers through alien technology to fight evil? While I don't agree with the premise of the question (I mean, does it really need to be realistic?), I also don't think the answer is to wait until the very end to introduce the franchises sillier minutia. Especially when the directing and editing would make anyone with eyeballs want to spin them back into their head. It's not Fantastic Four (2014)-level bad, but the fact that I'm bringing up that film in the same breath as this one, is evidence their both are in the same ball park and both need to answer for the millions of dollars wasted. I mean come on, the best part about this mess is the slovenly fight choreography which could have been done with a couple of costumes and a million yen.It's hard to say Power Rangers (sponsored by Krispy Kreme) is the latest victim in franchise co-oping by greedy executives, short-sighted PR experts and story-arcs by committee. While Spider-Man fans and Batman fans could argue their IP's came from some nebulous notion of artistry over commerce, Power Rangers has been a cheaply cobbled cash grab pretty much from inception. In that regard the fact that this film has any semblance of sincerity is a minor miracle. If you got to see it, focus on that and that alone. Go, go mediocrity.","4/10"
"Power Rangers","CountJonnie","23 September 2019","This is what happens when you take away the charm of a series that was funny in a cheesy way. The '93 series may have been deliberately bad, with horrible effects, acting, stories and was a glorified casting call for stunt performers. But it was funny, charming and witty. But when you take away the charm, all you're left with is a bad movie, that even managed to mess up the putty patrollers. What a shame!","4/10"
"Power Rangers","AlexFalzon","23 March 2017","The new Power Rangers film features very little morphin' and is not exactly mighty.I should mention that the ""original"" (virtually all of the action sequences were actually stock footage from the Japanese Super Sentai) Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers was my favourite show between the ages of two and five. Believe it or not, though, I actually haven't watched this children's show in many years, so I can't really speak as to the film's loyalty to the source material.What I can say is that liberties have been taken with the characters' backstories, but the main personal attributes seem to be intact, and I had no problem with the changes. Trini (the yellow ranger) is gay, now, and Billy is ""on the spectrum"", but these changes merely gave depth to characters who really only existed as obvious stereotypes in the original series, and I liked that.I have to say that I did find it quite amusing that they make a big deal out of announcing every single character's full name in the final scene, but omit Trini's surname. Billy's mother calls out all of the other rangers' full names, and ends with ""and Trini!"" I can only assume that it's because in the show, her last name was Kwan, and the new actress, Becky G, is of Mexican descent. Just call her Kwan or give her a different name, good lord. Even funnier, in the end- credits every single actor playing a ranger's parent is credited with their character's name, except Trini's parents, who are credited as ""Trini's Dad"" and ""Trini's Mom"".The film stars the aforementioned Becky G, as well as her four team-mates played by Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, and Ludi Lin. I assumed all five were American (only two are), so flawless were their accents. They all deliver solid performances, with Montgomery and Cyler the only ones required by the screenplay to do any real acting. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks join the cast as the team's mentor and antagonist, respectively. Both are great, obviously, though seem to think themselves in an entirely different film than the main five. The tone of these two characters, both in dialogue and delivery, clashes crazily against the other five. It was probably intentional, but it was weird. There are certain extreme moments of melodrama sandwiched between scenes of cheesiness that just feel out-of-place, too.So in the movie the five teenagers with attitude (sadly, or perhaps thankfully, they are not referred to as such in the film) come across a mysterious rock and a strange cave, waking up the next morning with superpowers. They reunite and try to work out what's going on while familiarising themselves with their new abilities. If this sounds familiar, that's because it's basically the plot of Chronicle. Funnily enough, the writer of that film, Max Landis, was actually at one point attached to this movie, but is no longer credited. Weird.Five writers (count them), however, are credited. As often happens with films with a large number of writers, the script feels somewhat off. We begin with a coincidence that feels more lazy than anything; at the exact moment the five obtain their new powers, the antagonist's ""dead"" body is accidentally caught in a fishing net. For an even worse coincidence within a coincidence, the captain of that boat happens to be the father of one of the rangers. Of course.It's director Dean Israelite's second film, and I don't think his direction left much to be desired. His first film was Project Almanac, and I preferred Power Rangers over that one, The score is solid, the soundtrack pretty hit-and-miss. The editing is a little disappointing at times; we only see the rangers morph once, and it's not a very comprehensive look that we get. Also, Jason appears to pull a sword from nowhere and then we get a scene of him returning it to the space-ship later. Not sure what happened there. The action's decent, but we only get to it in the final twenty minutes of the film, and I mean that literally. There's no end-of-act-1 skirmish; the bad guys simply attack at the end of the movie.One other thing I find mildly irritating was the rangers' helmets retracting around their faces whenever they spoke. I guess the intentional might've been to make them feel more like relatable people and less like faceless drones, but it just came across as a lazy way to give the actors more face-time – which is silly, because, as I said, they only morph the one time. We've seen their faces plenty.The red ranger drives a red Ford Ranger, that was kind of cute. Certainly more subtle than when that same ranger hurls a Camaro at a bad guy and yells ""sorry, Bumblebee!"". Man, that moment was a funny little jab at the Transformers franchise; why'd you have to go and ruin it by playing Captain Obvious? The first song over the credits is the same as in the original film from 1995, so that was a nice reference, but I think I would've preferred the opening theme to the television show. That theme only plays once in the whole film, and is horribly misused. It only plays for a few seconds, and only the main chorus. Where's the build up!? You need to work up to it, you don't just blare it out for a second and then end it before we even realise it's playinghttp://alexfalzon.com/power-rangers/ - for more reviews.","4/10"
"Power Rangers","afjmf","4 April 2017","This is not a Power Ranger movies. You can see the title and think ""Go, Go, Power Rangers!"" in your head, but there the similarities end. I will break down what this movie is by percentages: 5% Pacific Rim, 15% Power Rangers, 40% Chronicle, and 40% The Breakfast Club. All the race changes do not make a cool movie. It makes the First five look bad, Alpha-5 look stupid, and Zordon look self-serving. Goldar is totally wrong and Rita was designed after a Power Rangers in Space villain. Zordon does want to stop Rita, who had Been a Ranger (?), 65 million years ago with Zordon (?)and was trapped in a cave or something, while Zordon was trapped in the Morphin Grid. I say Zordon is self-serving because the only reason, initially, is so the Morphin Grid will open and he can reenter the world a living being. The part that gets me is when Billy (now a black nerd with weak hip-hop moves ""dies"", Zordon has the chance to become ""alive"" again, and brings him back to life. This irks me as Zordon as the Blue Ranger would be most interesting, and would Billy have been stuck in the wall? Poor Zack is the most pathetic though. Now an poor Asian with a sick mother, he is so bland as Billy got the dance moves. This movie is Voltron meets Chronicle, and it is mostly boring trash.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","RforFilm","24 March 2017","Anyone (not just kids) will tell you that part of the 1990s couldn't be understood without looking at one of the biggest phenomenons that debuted at the time, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. I'm aware that the show is still on TV, though it's been a long time since I watched it. As a kid of the 90s, I can say that I liked watching it and even held a Power Rangers birthday party when I was in the second grade. Unlike Disney or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers were something of a fad that I kept in my heart for about three years before I moved on.For those that don't know, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came from Japanese show called Super Sentai. While all the scenes featuring the rangers fighting monsters, puttys and Rita Repulsa came from Japan ala stock footage, the American footage was new and featured new teenagers becoming the rangers to stop evil. I gave the show another watch recently and discovered that it was way cheesier then I remembered. However, there is a fascination with just how cheesy it was and I had fun exploring it. Like a lot of recent super hero movies, our teenage heroes get their turn for a gritty reboot in Power Rangers. In the Northern California town of Angel Grove, young Jason Scott (played by Dacre Montgomery) ruins his football career after a prank gets him arrested. While in detention, he ends up befriending autistic Billy Cranston (played by RJ Miller) and popular girl Kimberly Hart (played by Naomi Scott). The three end up at a rock quarry where Billy is working on uncovering a mysterious object while the too-cool-for-school punk Zack (played by Ludi Lin) and quiet loner Trini (played by Becky G) happen to be at the same time. The objects are rock-like coins that change their lives forever. All five teenagers wake up the next morning to see that their stronger and more resistant to pain. They agree to go back to the site to look for answers. There they find a space ship that has been hidden for millions of years. Awaiting them is Zodon (played by Brian Cranston), a former ranger who seems to be a part of the ships power grid, and Alpha 5 (played by Bill Hader). The kids are told that the coins chose them to become the new rangers. They have to adapt to their new powers soon to stop the recently awoken witch Ritia Repulsa (played by Elizabeth Banks).I have to give Power Rangers a lot of credit for attempting to take a lot of the ridiculous concepts for the show and trying to make them more grounded. The results are mixed, even though overall I had fun. The best thing about this movie was something that the show lacked; the chemistry and emotion from the five teenagers. Not only are all five good actors, but the movie takes a lot of time getting to know them and just how they came to form their team.Even Brian Cranston and Bill Hader do well in adapting their characters to the big screen. One of the weaker performances is Elizabeth Banks. While everyone seems to be playing their parts seriously, she made her character very campy. While she can be fun to watch, it can come off as inconsistent.Speaking of which, the overall tone seems to mix fine until the end. You'll be surprised to learn that out heroes don't morph until way later. Once they do, the movie seems to have trouble sticking to it's gritty origin, especially when the zords start to fight the larger monsters. It's not as impressive as Pacific Rim, but it's better shot then the remake of Godzilla. I'd say the movie is stronger when the characters don't morph.I'll give this seven red ranger helmets out of ten. I'm surprised how much care went into the scriptbefore the characters become the Power Rangers. It seems that the movies really wants to emulate The Breakfast Club more then it does the TV show is based off of. If you didn't like the show, your probably not going to like the movie. It'll probably satisfy former fans like myself and those that want some sci-fi action. I'd say of your even a little curious, then go go see this movie.","3/10"
"Power Rangers","Leptirko","14 April 2017","You can easily skip first 1:30h of the movie because of typical teenage movie drama. Morphing comes really late in the movie, almost till the end of it. Bryan Cranston did a great job as always. Morphing was fresh looking - animation wise and that's all good I could find. For a 100 million budget movie, it should have looked way better. Actors are still green at best. I must say that old school Power rangers are still better than these ones.","2/10"

"Power Rangers","lalegre-05136","24 March 2017","This reboot is by far one of the worst I have seen. I grew up in the 90s and my love for power Rangers was dear. If you are an original fan please DO NOT watch. The film was sexualized and at times a little disturbing. This remake is for a whole new generation. If this is what we are producing for the next generation then this is unsettling. The audience In the movie seemed to enjoy this movie but as an original fan I had to walk out half way. The actors performed more on a chessy, no acting skills level. The villain was a tormented individual with no talent. Zordon was completely different, more of an aggressive angry frustrated personality. That alone made me walk out, original Zordon was patient, wise, and kind. I believe we got 15 minutes of fighting if that in this 2 hour movie. Everything that was once positive about the series, was completely missing in the movie. Sad to say, the new Power Rangers movie was a disaster.","5/10"

"Power Rangers","ironhorse_iv","6 April 2017","Like the highly popular 1990s show distributed by Saban Entertainment (later Saban Brands), the movie directed by Dean Israelite & written by John Gatins with story by Burk Sharpless, Matt Sazama, Kieran and Michele Mulroney, tells the story of five teenagers with attitude: Jason Lee Scott AKA Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly Hart AKA Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott), Billy Cranston AKA Blue Ranger (RJ Cyler), Zack Taylor AKA Black Ranger (Ludi Lin) & Trini Kwan AKA Yellow Ranger (Becky G) being recruited by the all-powerful inter-dimensional being named Zordon (Bryan Cranston) to save the Planet Earth from the wicked threats of the evil witch/former Green Ranger, Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) and her horde of monsters. Without spoiling the movie, too much, when, first seeing the trailer, I was somewhat skeptical on how, this movie was being presented. After all, I was very tired of seeing fake-looking CGI, horrible dialogue and heavy broody teenager storyline clichés story writing, whenever Hollywood attempts to reboot a beloved, pre-existing kid's show property onto the big screen. It had all the red flags. However, after watching this movie; I can say, the film was not that bad, but not great, either. A decent film with a really cool 1980s vibe electric synthesizer mixed current popular tunes soundtrack by Brian Tyler. Plus, I like how they fit the retro 'Go Go Power Rangers' theme song. And that's coming from not a huge fan of anything Tokusatsu! Yes, over the years, 'The Power Rangers' TV series has had many incarnations, and with that, came along many big screen movies ranging from 1995's 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie' to 1997's 'Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'. However, it's safe to say, this 2017's reboot of the hugely popular '90s Fox Kids TV show is probably the best of the film series. It could even be, better than the original show. I know a many of you, are thinking, how could, I say that, since I call this movie 'only decent', but let me explain. The movie will never, outdo the popularity of the original show, the kid show was a 1990s pop culture phenomenon. An enigma that help usher, more Japanese kid's shows to US audiences. Although, this movie did outdo the original, in fleshing out the character, through character development and arches. The original show is full of somewhat racist stereotypes & awful pun-driven jokes, & unrealistic goodie two shoes teenagers who look nothing like their age. At least, in this movie, the characters were all unique and ground-breaking. After all, who ever heard of an artistic & lesbian ranger, before? While, some of their actions is indeed, not family friendly & somewhat clichés; at least, they seem like teenager dealing with angst, unlike the original. I love the redemption storyline, they were forced to go through. It made, some scenes like the camp fire and dock scene kinda heart-breaking. All the actors playing the rangers were great in the roles, even if they can be a bit annoying at times. Also, the acting in this film is a lot better than the original. While, the original cast is all iconic. They're by far, worst actors, then this new crew. However, I do miss, Bulk & Skull. Don't like the generic bullies in this movie. Still, the villains in this new movie was somewhat better. Don't get me wrong, Machiko Soga as Rita was fun to watch, but Elizabeth Banks as Rita was downright scary. She really did seem like a threat to be taken seriously. She was amazing. However, I can't say the same with Bill Hader & Bryan Cranston's performance. Hader's voice work for Alpha 5 seem kinda of jarring and out of place. At least, he wasn't as annoying as the original; while, Cranston seem limited to a few facial expression due to what the animator could animate in a few short months. It explains, why you rarely see his face, but hear his voice in the dark background. That's another problem with this film, it has way too many night sequences. Even with some light & amps up violence, the fake-looking fast-motion CGI action & wired work stunt long jumping looks terrible & sloppy. While, the 1990s 'The Power Rangers' is just as infamous with its very simplistic visual effects, with people in fake-looking rubber suits, cheap fireworks and recycle Japanese 'Super Sentai 'franchise stock footage. At least, it was bright and easy to see. Other problems, this movie has is the choppy editing and lack of exposition. Some scenes just don't go anywhere, or seem abandoned. A good example is how and why everybody got near the cave site in the middle of nowhere at the time. Also, it never really explained how they got from the second car crash of the movie to back to their own beds, since the Command Center does not seem to have teleportation capabilities. Also, the movie doesn't explain, why a ranger can only morph, when only they all can work as a team, but how Rita can still powerful even after betraying her team and built Goldar!? Nor does it explain how crashing multiply cars, and blowing up your locker, led to detention, and not seriously jail time as terrorism. However, the biggest complain, I got about this movie is the blatant produce placement of Kristy Kreme. It feature so much, it borderline into absurdity. There's a certain level of cheesiness, I'm willing to take, and a goal plot of getting to Kristy Kreme is not one of them. Overall: At the end of the day, the movie is just fun. It's a popcorn flick & that's all that matters. Maybe, not good enough to watch in theaters, but good enough to rent. Still, it made me, excited for a sequel!!! I enjoyed the hell out of it.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","tormentalol","22 March 2017","Loved it! Great fun for family and kids. Contains quite a few references to the TV shows and comics. Really well executed for what it wants to be. RJ Cyler (Billy, the Blue Ranger) gives a great performance that steals the show for me. However its a movie that most of critics wont enjoy, because its not made for their demographic, unlike many others in the same category. Its a movie made for fans of the show and also to a younger audience, with details that maybe wont reach the older audience or non-fans. Overall, it is really worth checking it out for what it is!","1/10"

"Power Rangers","m_kelava","17 April 2017","The whole experience started kind of good. The first 20 minutes were mostly alright, but in my mind what the movie failed to capture as a whole was that the fact it is not the 90s anymore and even tho CGI was decent I failed to find that nostalgia feel that I was in search of when I heard the new Power Rangers movies was coming out. You do not feel anything for the characters and by the end I had felt that it was only starting to get good. It mostly feels like an elderly man tried to make something teenagers would find interesting, but the problem is, that elderly man is stuck in the last century and most of us had moved on. They forgot that kids of today couldn't care less about Power Rangers and that only people like me who used to watch the shows as a kid would be interested tho laziness added to it not being interesting and in my opinion pretty dumb. Characters are stereotypical high school kids you cannot relate too because I guess the writers couldn't bother or were afraid of any backlash had they done anything mildly interesting with them, as we see in all sorts of media today. There are certain points where you can feel what it could have been but those moments drop off pretty quickly and you find yourself either mocking scenes or plainly not caring for the characters or anything really as I did. Overall I cannot give it one star because I had paid to see it, which in my opinion is already too much for something like this, but I think had the characters been interesting as individuals and if the story hadn't felt rushed by the end it might have even been a good movie worthy of my time and nostalgia.","2/10"

"Power Rangers","stevendbeard","24 March 2017","I saw ""Power Rangers"", starring Dacre Montgomery-Stranger Things_tv, Safe Neighborhood; Naomi Scott-Inspector Lewis_tv, The 33; Elizabeth Banks-The Hunger Games movies, Slither; Bryan Cranston-The Infiltrator, Rock of Ages and the voice of Bill Hader-Popstar:Never Stop Never Stopping, Men in Black 3.This is the 3rd Power Rangers theatrical movie-the first was 1995's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers & the second was 1997's Turbo:A Power Rangers Movie-but this is actually a reboot and not really connected to the previous movies or TV shows. It has better effects-Duh!-and a couple of cameos of previous Rangers-Jason David Frank & Amy Jo Johnson-so keep an eye out during a crowd scene in Angel Grove. They are easy to spot, the camera stays on them for a bit. This movie starts with an alien team of Power Rangers, led by Bryan/Zordon, that are fighting Elizabeth/Rita Repulsa during the dinosaur age of the Earth. After the results of that battle, flash to the present, where teenagers Dacre, Naomi and three others find 5 power coins which lead them to a buried space ship. Bill voices a robot called Alpha 5, who is on board and introduces them to Bryan, who is now part of the ship and communicates as a disembodied head. The teens are informed that they have been chosen to become the new Power Rangers, super heroes that protect the Earth, and the training begins. Otherwise, the usual aspects of the Power Ranger universe are here; lots of martial arts fighting, rock-like creatures as henchmen, giant titans in battle, Zords and they do use the Power Rangers theme song-Go Go Power Rangers! As the end credits start, there is a quick scene having something to do with Tommy Oliver but there is nothing at the very end of the movie. FYI: In case you are one of those ignorant people that wanted to boycott Beauty & the Beast-for some kind of gay issues-then you might want to steer clear from this movie, too. Otherwise, you might just meet the first homosexual Power Ranger. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi violence, action and destruction, language and some crude humor and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. The Power Rangers are not for everyone-I know some people that do not care for them-but I really liked this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.","5/10"
"Power Rangers","MattyRich92","20 May 2019","Instead of making a two hour drama, it should have been an hour and a half action movie. The creative team invents their own Power Ranger lore, and it's like Twilight sexed Transformers. The tone shifts abruptly in the third act. It goes from serious Y. A. movie to Saturday morning cartoon. Power Rangers is supposed to be a pilot movie, but, as far as I can tell, no sequels are in production.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","Pumpkin_Man","27 March 2017","Just warning you, this review will contain spoilers, mostly about the things I didn't like and how it compares to the show. You have been warned! As a child of the 90's, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows. That was my jam. I had a lot of the toys, and my mom took me to see the original Power Rangers movie with Ivan Ooze when it was released at the theater way back in 1995. 20 years later, along comes a newer rebooted darker PG-13 Power Rangers movie. I was kinda excited, but wasn't liking the look of Rita Repulsa or Goldar from the trailers. Now, after seeing the movie, I still have very mixed feelings about it. I didn't like that they didn't start out as friends. In the show, they were already best friends. Here, they are social outcasts who try to get along with each other. There was no Bulk and Skull, no Ernie, no Youth Center/Juice Bar, I still don't like the look of Goldar. They only played the ""Go go Power Rangers"" theme song for a couple of seconds when they got into their Zords. I could probably go on a little longer, but I'll mention just two more things; they couldn't even morph til the last 20 minutes of the movie, and Zordon was very critical of them. In the series, he already had confidence in them. I understand this is a reboot and it's starting over, but as a nostalgic kid of the 90's, I couldn't help but compare it to the show.Jason is a football all-star, but throws it away when he pulls a prank and gets involved in a police chase. He's put in detention where he meets Billy and Kimberly. Billy takes Jason out to a quarry where they find 5 colorful crystals. (Kimberly, Zack and Trini just so happened to be out there too) The crystals give them superhuman strength and powers (This contradicts the series because they only had their powers when they morphed into their armor, but oh well) They go back to the quarry, and stumble upon a giant spaceship where Zordon and Alpha 5 have lived for the last 65 million years. Meanwhile, a fishing boat stumbles upon Rita Repulsa's body in the sea. They bring her onboard and she begins to resurrect herself. Rita needs lots of gold to bring Goldar to life to help her find the Zeo crystal. Throughout the film, the gang trains and tries to morph. When they finally do morph, it's pretty cool, but the fighting and action scenes were quite underwhelming. I even remember thinking to myself ""That's it?"" Elizabeth Banks did a fairly good job as Rita. She even says ""Make my monster grow!"" I didn't hate the movie, I just think it could've been done better. I'll definitely buy it when it comes out to Blu-Ray. I'll say that this film will really make you appreciate the TV series and the '95 film with Ivan Ooze better. If you're an old school Power Rangers fan, you might like SABAN'S POWER RANGERS!!!","4/10"
"Power Rangers","Quebec_Dragon","22 March 2017","I'm a guy in his early forties who usually loves (good) superhero movies. I've only caught a few episodes of Power Rangers here and there over the years, found it campy, predictable fun, but wasn't really a fan. I write this so you know where this opinion comes from. So after a promising start in the distant past and some high-school hi-jinks with a bunch of misfits/rejects, something strange started happening. As more and more fantastical elements were introduced, the more I felt underwhelmed and doubtful. Not quite sure when it started, but it was particularly obvious with the introduction of the Zorgs (robot-dinosaur vehicles) that was very lacklustre. The Zorg designs might have been too ""detailed"", but I even had trouble making out what dinosaur they were supposed to be. To be fair, I love the new Ranger outfits although, once again, their first appearance was kind of muffed.The plot that seemed not so bad at first with actual character building got stupid and corny pretty fast with dumb decisions from both the heroes (yes, let's all jump) and the lame main villain (let's end all life on Earth with me on it, because, uh...). The actors certainly tried hard, were probably better than standard TV actors, but they didn't sell the touching or dramatic scenes to me. Then again, I also blame the script. However, the highlight acting-wise was the young black man called RJ Cyler in an autistic role (despite too much makeup). But beyond the plot and acting, kind of secondary in that type of film, there should have been a building sense of wonder and excitement that wasn't really there for me. The visual effects were hit (Zordon on the wall) and miss (the Zorgs). The fights that should have been thrilling seemed mostly unexciting and uninspired to me, especially the last one. So without the nostalgia factor in its favour, this big-budget remake didn't make a Power Rangers fan out of me.Rating: 3.5 out of 10 (mediocre)P.S. A really obnoxious product placement actually got some of the few good laughs.","3/10"
"Power Rangers","Martinito_08183","24 July 2019","Lionsgate's latest attempt of making another franchise and yet they failed to understand how to make a good first film. They always forget that the audience has to be invested and to care on everything that is happening, so that it can be successful and everyone be excited for future installments, but every studio doesn't care at all. The only thing that they care is making money and art doesn't bring them that and that's why we get bland, boring, messy and broken products that are disguised as films.Saban's Power Rangers is just a bad film with many aspects that just don't work or having things that we've seen a thousand time before. I watched Power Rangers many times as a kid (DinoThunder, Mystic Force and Operation Overdrive) and while the TV franchise that the 2017 reboot is based on is very corny and cheesy, the film still had potential and opportunities to evolve into something special and different, but i didn't expect to become a very uninteresting and generic superhero film.","10/10"

"Power Rangers","asillett-57045","29 March 2017","This movie is boring, poorly written, and stupid. It's not stupid in a fun way, either. I went into this movie with expectations that I would have for a Transformers movie; I hoped for explosions, fun action scenes, and cool CGI. Guess what this movie had? NONE OF THAT. Because it was so boring, I was forced to sit through boring scenes of people talking about boring back stories.This movie suffered from the same problems that Superman v Batman and Suicide Squad suffered from: they tried so hard to fit so much stuff in, that the pacing is terrible and nothing feels like it goes together. The whole movie is very forgettable except one scene... (Spoilers, kinda)The opening scene, when the Red Ranger (who's character name I can't remember and can't be bothered to go back and look) gets into a car chase with the police after pulling a prank at the high school. The cinematography and camera-work is fantastic and really got my hopes very high for the rest of the movie. It's reminiscent of the tank scene from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. It's a little difficult to pay attention to everything that's going on, but at least it looks cool and keeps you engaged, UNLIKE THE REST OF THE MOVIE. Overall, I would say that no matter what reviews people read, they're going to see it no matter what. Also, (spoilers again) when they finally morph into the animal robots (I never watched the show much, so maybe I just don't get it) they play the original theme song from the show for no reason other than to force nostalgia. At least the original show, from what I did see, was campy and fun. This movie can't decide if it wants to be serious or funny (just like Suicide Squad). Come to think of it, this movie has a lot of similarities to Suicide Squad, except with Suicide Squad, it had more than THREE ACTION SCENES IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. This is a bad movie. Go see it.","6/10"

"Power Rangers","pianotm-58404","26 March 2017","Many of the bad reviews that came out for this movie make some good points, but a few are obviously pretentious, and are badmouthing the movie based on film snobbery and have little to do with the substance film. The film itself does not match the verdict of these pretentious reviews, all of which fail miserably to address any points of the film. It's as if these people expect even the lowest children's to have the same artistry as a Ridley Scott or an Orson Welles piece, and it begs the question, if these people demand such a high quality from their films, then why are they watching kid targeted superhero movies? Power Rangers starts out weak, with relatively poor cinematography in a chase sequence and an overall uncomfortable introduction to three of our heroes. It takes them awhile to start to have chemistry, but 15 to 20 minutes after the opening logos, they're starting to play well together, and the film starts to be enjoyable. Once they discover the coins and begin to develop their powers, it quickly becomes obvious that this movie was made by fans of the show, and while this is certainly a cash grab, it's anything but soulless. It's genuinely funny for all of the right reasons (and some of the wrong reasons). It has a few moral messages that don't quite hit the mark, but it's obvious what they're trying to say. Elizabeth Banks has the camp turned up to overdrive. This movie isn't Shakespeare and she knows it. She is totally not taking this seriously, and honest to goodness, I love her to death for it. She completely owns Rita Repulsa. She does over-the-top beautifully.The movie adds a bit of unnecessary angst. The Rangers aren't friends to start since they don't know each other, but for the most part, they play well together and most of their interaction is totally Breakfast Club, and they do it so well. Zordon has got the Rangers together for totally selfish reasons, and throughout the movie, he isn't the most likable character.Alpha 5 is perfect in every aspect. He's totally the Alpha 5 you remember but he's nicely refined and his place in the movie makes him irreplaceable.The film takes more time with the Zords. In the show, the Zords would immediately form Megazord upon being summoned. Here, it spends time showing us the individual Zords in action before showing us Megazord.It's true: this movie doesn't superhero quite like it's flashier competitors. It's action set pieces, except for the last one, aren't as big. Surprisingly, it's actually a little less flash and takes more time with the characters on an interpersonal level. Somehow, at the same time, it absolutely succeeds in delivering everything you expect from a Power Rangers movie. From morphing, to battles with enemies made from clay (fans will know the Putty Patrolers only too well), to robot battles, and finally to the giant Kaiju battle at the end. Even the theme is well represented. The movie has a multitude of obvious weaknesses, but it hits all of the right notes and it's exactly what you want from Power Rangers.","3/10"
"Power Rangers","drewmvshs-81721","13 June 2017","Especially in today's times:-With every resource being available to big studios and movie directors.-Where there are tons of excellent movies already made that can bestow inspiration and/or take example from.-The internet.. c'mon, it has anything a person could need (put in the effort, do research and this is how a regular person with a go pro and a laptop can produce some killer ""home"" productions).-In the case of a movie like this, that has decades of source material to pull from and analyze what made the TV show a hit to begin with.... I mean, it's like being handed a winning recipe, the ingredients, step-by- step directions, and a multi-person team to cook it.... and still fail miserably at it.Bottom line... There is really no excuse for a studio and/or director to produce trash like this. It's almost having to go out of your way to make it so awful.I don't want to give any spoilers, so I can instead say this honestly- It's just all bad. Dull actors to which we feel no connection, more annoyed by them if anything. Horrific CGI, yet almost all of the 2 whole fight scenes that amount to about 15 minutes of the film are that crap CGI. Yes, you read correctly, this movie is almost over before they even become power rangers and have their ""final (only) battle""... the ending of which is SO stupid, it makes you wonder if this movie is really a satire or parody than an actual, serious movie. It's more like a horribly cheesy teen drama that is trying WAY to hard to be cool. It reminds me nothing of the series at all other than retaining the names and using terms like power rangers and zords... Alpha, Zordon, Rita, the putties, and the Zords are almost unidentifiable... It's hilariously pathetic, really. Rita and Zordons ridiculous new origin stories are an example of the studio trying too hard, but just digging the hole deeper. The 5 minutes of screen time for the Mega Zord is a total let down because it doesn't even show it come together like the TV show and it doesn't look like a mega zord, but way more like one of the Transformers. There is no climax, tension, or suspense... most of it is hearing lame one liners from the cast, or watching them try to be extra cool. That mixed in with every one of them wanting to show us they are ""badasses"" by being rebellious teens who are too much for normal school, so they have to stay in detention all year, also by breaking the law repeatedly, underage drinking, using every cuss word they can think of, trying hard to play that sex appeal angle, and actually describing a bestiality scene that just happened off camera... WHAT?! However, the power ""discs"" (that are definitely not morphers) chose them because they are ""pure of heart"" lolololol... and that's the 1 thing the studio got right (at least in their minds they think it's getting it right) which is using all kinds of tired movie clichés and absurd, out of nowhere plot devices that both progress the story AND miraculously saves them a couple of different times from what appears to be certain death. Of course, these devices and plot holes are barely even mentioned, most times there was no bother to explain these select impossible moments to the audience..... It's like there were deleted scenes in a couple of parts almost, missing info.This MOVIE is a JOKE!It's an insult since it's an obvious cash grab, sponsored by Krispy Kreme. I cant remember how many times the words ""Krispy Kreme"" were said in this movie, and the krispy kreme building had more screen time than the action sequences. It was also central to the plot of the entire movie. Its clear the studio didn't even try to make it half way decent, they just wanted an ""Insta-Blockbuster/Franchise""","1/10"
"Power Rangers","Badmoviessuck","14 February 2019","This movie is a complete mess.DIALOGUE
The dialogue has a bunch of cringy one liners and it's not good at all.
They have a tendency to explain everything to us instead of showing us which is stupid.CHARACTERS
It feels like they tried to give the characters depth but during the production they just ignored it.
Jason has daddy issues and that gets ignored through the rest of the movie, Zack has a dying mother and that gets ignored as well, Trini has strict parents and that gets ignored, and the pink ranger has some school drama and that gets ignored (probably for the better).
None of them have true desires and motives and they dont change and grow and how they got together was stupid.
Jason protected black boy and pink ranger conveniently swam in that place were black boy explode stuff and Zack is just conveniently sitting somewhere and star power shows up from nowhere.
There was this scene were trini ran away from the others for no reason and i was confused.VILLAIN
The villain wants gold and she is stupid
first she has no real motive than to get kristalls cause of power which is really bland.
And also she is stupid.
She attacks Star power for no reason and explains were she is headed and then leaves her and dosen't even kill her which is very stupid.
And once they found the villain cause she explained were she was to Star power then they all go there get captured and then the villain explains her freaking plan which is really cliche and stupid.ACTION
The action is bland and there is nothing special to it and the final act was worse than black panthers final act.
How could they now that the megazord had wings that could be used as daggers when they have never even seen how the megazord looks? I'ts stupid.VERDICT

This movie was entertaining, but it also felt pretty cliché. The action felt like nothing we haven't seen from other movies like Transformers or Avengers with the CGI we have nowadays.To start off with the Rangers cast, I'm sure all of us can agree they weren't as good as the original 6 Power Rangers including Tommy, when the show first started. I'm amazed years later that they could have such a good cast of the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Even if they weren't the best at acting they were perfect for their parts of the characters they played. Naomi Scott doesn't even come close to how awesome Amy Jo Johnson was as Kimberly. Amy Jo Johnson is immediately still recognizable as Kimberly over 20-years later.Another thing about the characters, is even in the trailer, I've seen people compare this movie to The Breakfast Club with characters in High School getting in trouble and having Saturday detention. In the original series, the characters were good friends hanging out throughout the series. They were good kids and present themselves as role models for a kids show. In this movie, they were more like rebellious kids, especially Jason. The movie could have at least included Bulk and Skull in detention as Bulk and Skull were a main part of the original series, and always in detention.I also ought to mention that in Mighty Morphin, the characters were martial artists and gymnasts. It was cool to see martial arts in the show, and martial arts fights. Most of the episodes had unmorphed fights with the putties where we didn't see their super strength, but natural abilities. I ought to say the putty fight in episode 3, ""Teamwork"" where Trini and Kimberly were fighting putties at the dumpsite was amazing and the hitting was on sync with the music on that scene. You hear the beating sounds at the proper time when there is hitting. That small scene from the one of the first ever episodes of Power Rangers, has in my opinion more entertaining action than the action in this movie.The zords in this movie felt like what we'd see in a Transformers movie. In Mighty Morphin the dinozords were easily distinguishable. We saw them get called in most of the episodes and saw them come out from their hiding places, the Mastodon coming out of the Arctic, shooting cold blasts. The Pterodactyl coming out of a volcano. Sabertooth Tiger running really fast and jumping over a bush. In the movie the zords just felt like something they could each command with no individuality, and I thought seemed less realistic as CGI than how they filmed them in the original series.Rita on the other hand seemed better on this movie than the T.V. show. In the show she mostly resides on Moon Palace trying to come up with a diabolical plan to take over. In this movie, she was truly presented as an evil character. I feel like this Rita could kill the Power Rangers way more easily than Rita from the original series. So yeah, I'd say Rita was the one thing the movie did better than the show.The putties weren't as good. Not like stuntmen from the show where we again see actual martial arts without the super powers in action. I prefer the original effects as I think they seem more realistic especially movement. These CGI effects are cool, but mostly feel like something you'd see on a computer with fast movement that doesn't look as realistic as when the zords and Power Rangers morphed, are men in costumes. I've mostly complained and compared this to the series. It was still entertaining. I liked the scene where the characters get to know each others, which felt reminiscent to a scene in Breakfast Club. I also like the scene where they jump in the water and we see what's below it!! That scene was cool!! But, overall while an entertaining movie, it feels a little cliché to what we're used to seeing in cinema nowadays. I think the biggest flaw in the movie was not having martial arts like the show. But, it is still an entertaining movie I'm sure you'll find interesting. I'll give it a 6/10.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","dave-mcclain","24 March 2017","The Power Rangers are otherwise ordinary teenagers who are recruited, trained and equipped by the wizard-like Zordon to defend the earth against various extraterrestrial threats. The Power Rangers each dress in a distinctive color and have some individualized powers and weapons and some in common. These young superheroes operate under a strict set of guidelines which includes anonymity. The Power Rangers franchise started when media mogul Haim Saban adapted the Japanese franchise ""Super Sentai"" for American audiences (but using footage from the Japanese original). Since starting out as the Fox Kids TV series ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" in 1993, Power Rangers series have been produced by various entertainment companies and aired on various networks in the U.S. and around the world (including, ironically, back in Japan, where the concept was born). The characters have also appeared in toy form, in comics and video games and, in 1995 and 1997, in low budget feature films. The action adventure sci-fi movie ""Power Rangers"" (PG-13, 2:04) (also called ""Saban's Power Rangers"") represents a reboot and an expansion of the cinematic part of the franchise.Let's meet the new Power Rangers! Jason Scott (Dacre Montgomery), the teenager who becomes the Red Ranger (the group's leader), is a high school football star who has pulled one too many stupid pranks and lost his chance to play football in college. He's now wearing an ankle monitor and attending detention every Saturday to make up for his most recent misdeeds. Soon-to-be Pink Ranger Kimberly Hart (Naomi Scott) is a cheerleader who has committed a cruel faux pas which has led to her falling out of favor with her clique and also landed her in detention. Blue Ranger Billy Cranston (RJ Cyler) is an autistic kid who gets picked on at school and is also serving some time in detention. Black Ranger Zack (Ludi Lin) is a loner who spends much of his time caring for his terminally ill mother. Last, but not least, is Yellow Ranger Trini (musician and model Becky G), also a loner, who happens to represent the Q in LGBTQ and is an outsider among this group of outsiders, who initially refer to her as ""crazy girl"".Jason, Kimberly and Billy meet ""Breakfast Club"" style in Saturday detention and they all end up together at a local quarry, where they attract the attention of Zack and Trini (who happen to be hanging out there, individually) when Billy blows off the side of a hill searching for something that his (deceased) miner father had told him about. What Billy's explosion reveals is a sheer, glass-like sheet of rock which contains five differently colored medallions (red, pink, blue, yellow and black) or ""coins"". Each of the teens takes a coin and each wakes up the next morning to the realization that some things are different about them, not the least of which is suddenly being in possession of extreme strength. After they get together at school and compare notes, they decide to get together that night at the quarry to figure out what is happening to them and why. That's where things morph into something mighty weird.When they reassemble at the quarry, and after they discover that they can also climb really fast and jump really far, they find that at the bottom of a deep chasm is a lake which leads to an underground cavern where they find an ancient alien space ship. They are greeted by a robot named Alpha 5 (voiced by Bill Hader and looking like a cross between other-than-human 1980s movie characters Johnny 5 from ""Short Circuit"" and ""E.T."" from well, you know). Alpha 5 wakes up a former Red Ranger named Zordon (voiced and acted via motion capture by Bryan Cranston, who did a couple voices in the original TV series). Zordon lost his team and his own life 65 million years earlier fighting against a rogue Green Ranger called Rita Repulsa. (Zordon's consciousness was preserved in a computer.) Zordon explains that Rita (Elizabeth Banks) is power hungry and ""pure evil"" so he banished her to the bottom of the sea, but she is coming back and is intent on stealing the Zeo Crystal, which is what makes life on earth possible. Despite his fully articulated doubts, Zordon says that, if these five teenagers have the coins, it's not an accident and they are meant to be the next group of Power Rangers. The new Rangers also have their doubts, but they think that this is all pretty cool and they go along with Zordon's physically demanding training program as they also work to come together as a team so they can morph into fully capable Power Rangers, able to defeat Rita and her huge golden monster, Goldar, thus saving their small town.""Power Rangers"" is a worthy successor and enjoyable update to the 1990s pop culture juggernaut. Writer John Gatins (""Need for Speed"") and director Dean Israelite (""Project Almanac"") give us authentic characters, appealing visuals, good action and they strike just the right balance between honoring their source material and updating it for a new generation. Playing the Power Rangers are relative unknowns, but they are well-cast and pleasingly diverse – both as actors and in character. However, that's one of the reasons (along with an unnecessarily crude scene very early in the movie and a smattering of adult language) that makes this the first Power Rangers movie to be rated ""PG-13"" and questionable for small children. This is also the first Power Rangers movie to be (slightly) over two hours long but it feels rushed. It's an effective launch for a 21st century film franchise, but there's a lot going on (which is both good news and bad news). Plus, there are a few too many big coincidences in assembling the new Power Rangers and fueling their adventure, but this is still a mostly well-executed and entertaining movie. ""B+""","7/10"
"Power Rangers","phillipait99","16 June 2017","I loved this movie, it may not had best CGI but I node off to the writing to this movie and how they made the characters designs. I can relate to the characters and there backstory that it just hit home. And for being a fan since the first day, I'm very happy at the end result if you don't like this movie and your a fan since the beginning as well then you'll be no stranger to the comedy and weirdness/awesomeness that comes from power rangers, for blank sake they meant the teenage mutant ninja turtles But as I sat there in the theater I was just stuck watching the movie and I loved and everything about it I really hope for A lightspeed rescue","4/10"
"Power Rangers","CANpatbuck3664","25 March 2017","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a brief vision of some Rangers past in the Cenozoic Era (describing that scene would give too much away) we meet some of our current Power Rangers. Jason Scott (Dacre Montgomery) is pulling a prank by leading a cow into a locker room but he's interrupted by the police showing up to the school. He tries to drive away but he ends up causing an accident. He wrecks his knee in the process (prematurely ending his football career) and earns house-arrest and detention in the process. Also in that classroom serving detention are Kimberly (Naomi Scott) and Billy (RJ Cyler). Billy is autistic and is getting bullied by some other kids when Jason steps into protect him. To thank him, Billy offers to throw off the signal of his anklet and let him borrow his van. They venture out at night to a mine that Billy used to frequent with his dad (who is unfortunately deceased). After bumping into Kimberly unexpectedly, Jason is about to leave when Billy sets off an explosion in the mine. Two other teenagers Zack (Ludi Lin) and Trini (Becky G.) hear the explosion and come running. Under the rock is a thick glass-like substance with 5 different coloured stones buried beneath it. They hack them out and then flee the scene to avoid being caught by security.I watched the Power Rangers show when I was a kid but I was so young that I don't have finite memories or details from it. For a show that was known for how cheesy it could be, I was impressed with how they modernized the show for audiences today. Sure, this version was heavy on the CGI but the designs were a good mix of the familiar and the new. They put a lot of detail into story elements like the Ranger's backgrounds and while the tone of the movie fluctuates a lot (more on that later) I think they tried really hard to be innovative and bring fresh ideas to this potential franchise. I really liked how characters like Zordon, Alpha-5 and Rita Repulsa looked and the designs of the suits and even the Megazord were impressive.I mentioned character development and although the Rangers were all mildly annoying at different points in the story, (that's not the movie's fault, they're moody teenagers) Power Rangers gives each of the central cast strong motivations and a reason to yearn to inclusiveness. Their interactions with each other are relatively strong and their treatment of subjects that can be considered taboo were actually admirable (Billy being ""on the scale"" and Trini being LGBT). They don't skate over this stuff but they don't make a big deal of it either. They hit you over the head with how much these kids our outsiders but other than lacking some subtlety, Power Rangers treats these teenagers with respect and gives their actors/actresses the material to succeed.The Power Rangers themselves were all played by actors/actresses I hadn't heard of. I think they all do good work, I'd give the nod to RJ Cyler for being the standout. He would have been the comedic relief in any other movie but he's a nice balance of being funny and genuinely emotional. There wasn't a weak link among them. The movie also benefits from appearances by Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader. I was surprised Cranston would join this project but with his history in the show, he showed up to work and held up his end. Bill is always funny and Alpha-5 is a decent side-kick character. The actress I liked best in the movie was Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa. She seemed like she was the one who really understood what the movie was going for. I'm a fan of hers, she has both comedic and dramatic chops in spades and she walked a delicate line between being a menacing villain and a scenery-chewing bad girl.I've had a lot of praise for Power Rangers so far but the movie does have a couple of problems. The first and probably the most important is that it can't escape how cheesy the show's subject matter was. They try to create realistic characters but the more fantastical elements of the show come off as corny. There were some times that I couldn't help but roll my eyes or laugh even sitting around serious fans. It stopped me from completely getting into the movie. The other thing is that Power Rangers might have the most obvious and ridiculous bit of product placement in a wide release movie that I've ever seen. It was actually jarring and impossible not to snicker at (I won't say what the company was but they must have paid a serious portion of the budget).The subject matter of Power Rangers seemed suited for younger kids but with how dark the subject matter is at specific points (there are scenes with Rita Repulsa that almost seem like they were lifted out of a horror movie), I wouldn't recommend it for really young children. This movie will play really well for fans, I saw it with a friend who was a big fan of the show and he left the theatre ecstatic. This movie was better than it had any right to be and I could easily see it jump-starting a franchise. I can't say I loved it but I would give it a solid 6.5/10 rounding up to a 7.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","ivanmessimilos","31 May 2022","What a bad and boring movie. Almost the entire film takes on the origin of the story, and when the action finally starts and the main thing (the film is called Power Rangers) is made very bad visually and without meaning. The villain was pointless and over the top. They didn't even play the nostalgia card, and maybe they should. This is how the Power Rangers movie for new generations turns out, and it was by no means good.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","ThunderKing6","24 July 2021","It's not Corny like the classic MMPR. However, It's not a game changer. I still liked it.Despite the Power Rangers looking like jaw breaker candies it was an entertaining flick. Children should like this one.It's the typical over done power ranger story but dark. Rita returns, wants revenge and Zordon and Alpha need teenagers with attitude. The kids are summoned and the struggle at first then by the end...the good guys win.I honestly was hoping for a sequel. Even though this movie wasn't a game changer I still enjoyed it.Last Words: Go GO Power Rangers.","4/10"
"Power Rangers","ivana-simeonovic89","24 June 2017","My review is going to be short. To those who always expect to see the masterpiece in every movie - please, don't. Or at least don't come here and bash with bad reviews. I understand the personal opinion, but common. This is for kids and teenagers. It promotes good virtues and friendship. It has a old-timer story with Rita and good fighting the evil with some cool Zorgs. :) It really took me back to childhood, and that cannot be a bad thing. The old Kim and Tommy at the end got me even a bit emotional. :D Just kidding, I am really not a critic and it takes for a movie to be a really big piece of s*** for me not to like it. So, maybe, my review is not going to help those who haven't seen the movie. For me, it is good. If you want to lose yourself in an imaginary world for a couple of hours, go ahead. :)","5/10"
"Power Rangers","borneobrian","23 November 2020","The film seems promising, with the power rangers being on the big screen again, but when you watch it, you'll feel robbed. The film lacks the fun campy tone of its source material and Feels dull and weak on its overall presentation. The performances are alright, but the character's personality's feel mixed up and not interesting to watch. The character, zord, and monster designs look almost nothing like they do in the show and it makes me wonder if these guys ever watched it. All in all, just watch the original show if you want satisfaction.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","capone666","18 June 2017","Power RangersThe most important lesson Powers Rangers taught children was which colour represents which race.Sadly, that useful education tool has been omitted from this fantasy.When a disgraced quarterback (Dacre Montgomery), a troubled cheerleader (Naomi Scott), an autistic nerd (RJ Cyler), a lesbian loner (Becky G) and a momma's boy (Ludi Lin) unearth ancient colour coded coins they gain unimaginable powers.Aided by their new mentor (Bryan Cranston), his android (Bill Hader) and their vehicles that morph into a mega mecha, the quintet sets out to stop a former ranger (Elizabeth Banks) from finding the all-powerful Zeo Crystal. While this update of the Japanese super-hero kids' show manages to represent all races and special interests, its inconstant tone keeps it from telling an engaging story. The lack of mega-sized monsters is also concerning.Incidentally, the best way to keep colossal combatants off your building is to install massive bird spikes.

"Power Rangers","jonwycoco","14 December 2017","Acting is a little overdone, but then again so was the original. As a person who grew up with the show when it first aired, this rendition is meant to be another genesis story. Provide a little more background and bring it up to today's technological specs. While I think it tried too hard and perhaps did try to take itself a bit too seriously, if you come in with an open mind about it, you'll be somewhat surprised and may find that you enjoy it. I found that the camera angles and cinematography was okay, but it had moments where it felt very cheesy. If they could have picked up a really good director for action / sci-first (eg Whedon), we could have had a really excellent and fun movie. Alas, it falls slightly short of good. If you're looking for a bit of a campy movie with some good cheese factor, check it out. Otherwise, perhaps pass this one up.","1/10"
"Power Rangers","chris-r-morgan-713-2589","27 March 2017","For the love of all that is decent and holy, this movie is an ORIGIN story. I keep hearing people talk about how they ""loved"" the movie, but they talk about all the things that the ""didn't see"" or ""wanted to see more of"". Forget the original series and the original movies, this is a REEEEBBBOOOOTTTT which means a complete retelling of the original story. It is not going to be exactly the same as before, do not judge this move based on what you think it should be or what the critics expect it to be. This is a restart of the franchise and if you take it as such there should be better reviews. They do not fight till the end, when they have over come all the other obstacles in their way. This is by far the way all origins stories should be done.","10/10"

"Power Rangers","SnoopyStyle","15 July 2017","The Power Rangers led by Zordon battle Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) to protect all life on Earth and the Zeo Crystal. They send Rita to the bottom of the ocean but die in the process. Sixty five million years later, Jason Scott is the star high school quarterback in the fishing town Angel Grove. His prank turns into a high speed crash and life time of detentions. He saves peculiar Billy Cranston from a bully. He goes to the quarry with Billy and finds former cheerleader Kimberly Hart. Billy finds alien coins in the rocks. Along with Zack and Trini, the five teenagers turn into the new Power Rangers.The five fresh-faced kids are perfectly nice actors. Billy is marginally annoying at times but the kids sometimes have good exchanges. The characters should start with better chemistry. They should probably do a Breakfast Club before going off on their adventures. They need to be friends before breaking up and the inevitable reunion. There are attempts at humor and plenty of CGI action. This sort of works until it doesn't.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","PetarNeo","4 April 2017","There was a huge anticipation for this movie and considering there was a 20 years between first on screen Rangers this was a potentially big hit but things went really in bad direction from the beginning. Dean Israelite gets a chance for his big directorial debut in this large scale movie but drops us a C-movie with not so good directing, which is choppy and doesn't gets us sucked enough to consider it to be a really enjoyable movie. Movie feels completely stolen from the writing forward and it there is a huge resemblance to other movies which starts to feel annoying and there is a constant pursuit for characters which could possibly add something good the movie. Jason Scott/Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery) is the problematic star of them all and his effort in uniting and starting to matter again is well done. Kimberly Hart/Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott) is probably the weakest part of movie because she tries matter in movie but her scenes are easily forgotten. Billy Cranston/Blue Ranger (RJ Cyler) was better part and there are quite few mysteries that resemble with him but RJ kept us interested in him because of his charisma and likeness that he brought with his character. Trini Kwan/Yellow Ranger (Becky G) was the most random character and everything about her feels artificial and she was a really bad add to the crew. Zack Taylor/ Black Ranger (Ludi Lin) brought some story with him that was actually helpful in his representation but it was all in vain because of his irritating and badly written actions that he featured. Alpha 5 is the best part of the movie because he was funny and always on high note with his actions and he stole every scene that he was in. Zordon (Bryan Cranston) was as good as was bad but he also lacked a importance and that resulted in meaningless scenes that weren't quite good. Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) was quite good in her portrayal and it was interesting to watch her but her character looks very funny shown on screen and there looks like she hasn't much power. Story behind whole Power Rangers looks ridiculous and there are large issues with many scenes that were shot and without many explanation. It felt like a bad movie with some cool tech but bad directing and probably good story that featured not so good acting and not giving us experience that was looked for. 1.5/4","1/10"

"Power Rangers","TxMike","21 July 2017","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay. As such the picture and sound, Dolby Atmos, are top-notch. In fact my powered subwoofer was put through quite a workout from the opening scene and through the whole movie. Things in my viewing room were shaking!This amounts to an origin story for the Power Rangers. We see an opening scene of a great battle some millions of years back, the result being a giant machine and some colored tokens are buried deep in a mountain near a gold mine.We are introduced one by one to 5 different high school students, and when they are brought together by different reasons to the site on the mountain, when one of them ignites an explosive the innards are exposed and they discover the colored tokens, they each take one, and find out the next day they are super strong.There is a lot going on, hard to easily summarize, but they find out they must train and learn to morph into Power Rangers to successfully battle the evil woman and save the world.This isn't high art but it is made in an interesting manner. The last scenes feature a fierce battle, almost mandatory in this type of movie. But the young actors present themselves well and we come away feeling good about them.An interesting BluRay ""extra"" is a presentation of the history of the Power Rangers in cinema and TV. Amy Jo Johnson, now in her 40s, has a brief cameo in the movie near the end, she was one of the Power Rangers in the 1993 movie.","4/10"

The cgi looked great, the story behind each character was quite deep and relatable. Also, there were many clips that explains the story of why the power rangers are formed and why the villain is attacking the city. The movie was not nostalgic BECAUSE it's a reboot, it's meant to create nostalgia for the new generation of fans, not us 90s spandex fanboys. I'm no movie expert which is why I may be slightly on the optimistic side but give the movie a go, it won't hurt if you just try it out and not listen to the picky critics","6/10"

This movie just suffers from some pacing problems and a severe lack of energy.","2/10"
"Power Rangers","nenadperovic-1","16 June 2017","Seeing how insultingly low rating this movie has I gave it a 10 and I stand by it. Having watched this movie and having read the reviews for it I feel compelled to say something. This movie was never supposed to be serious or ""what is the meaning of life deep"". This is an excellent retelling of a classic story that some of was followed when we were kids. Granted the original was far far faaaar more ridiculous than this but it didn't matter when we were little kids. All we knew was, Rita-bad, rangers-good. So if you are going to watch this movie with the expectation that it will somehow change your view of the world or make you think, watch Life of Pi or something like that. But if you want to have a nostalgia moment and see your favorite childhood heroes kick some butt then I highly recommend this movie. It was great fun watching this on the big screen with a better script than any of the original rangers ever had. So if you want to have some fun, enjoy. If not, don't compare it to Schindler's list and tell me it sucks. Compare it to Iron man, Pacific Rim and then tell me how it good/bad it is. Different criteria for different types of movies people.","1/10"
"Power Rangers","ericstevenson","26 March 2017","I am impressed at how ""Power Rangers"" remains popular after all these years. I think I might have been a fan when I was really little, but I barely have any memories now. There really are a lot of good things about this movie but there are some parts that are just plain bad. I admit that the special effects didn't look too good from the trailers. On the big screen, they really are quite impressive! Seeing as how the show relied on stock footage from ""Super Sentai"", it really is great to see all new footage they made for this movie. I admit it's kind of weird to have a show known for being so campy be so serious here and grittier here, but it really did work well.I have to get to one thing that just weighs this film down like mad. An important part of the plot is that a crystal is located under a Krispy Kreme shop. Yeah, the continually show the Krispy Kreme logo over and over and it just makes it seem like a massive sellout. It's really some of the most blatant product placement I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, I am kind of in the mood to go there. This didn't need to be a part of the plot. If the crystal was in just some random place it would have made as much sense.It's also disappointing that the Power Rangers in full costume don't even appear until three fourths into the movie! Still, the battle scenes they did give us are fairly nice. I like the effect with Zordon and think Bryan Cranston was a good choice to play him. They even show a version of the awesome theme song. Again, not a fan, but boy is that a great song! Alpha is designed pretty well and I like his character. Unfortunately, it does seem like a lot of it is just an attempt for a long running series to stay relevant, but at least it doesn't rely on it that much. There's lots of good and bad things, but you should see it and judge for yourself. **1/2","10/10"
"Power Rangers","westsideschl","15 July 2017","Positive: CGI good enough to entertain any mature under 16 teen & any immature under 21 teen. Everyone else, it's hopeless for you. Negatives: 1. This, and most of the other points indicate formula, already done a hundred times, story hooks. So let's begin with  2. Crystals that rule the Universe? And, they come in pretty plastic colors. By the way, do any of these writers have any education beyond 7th grade to realize how big the Universe is? 3. We need an evil one - right! In this case her name is Rita and she's like over 65 million years old, but doesn't look a day past 35 (she's going to like that). Rita likes to wear plastic Hollywood fantasy clothing with customary makeup to look ferocious. 4. Lots of excessively rational mind blowing coincidences in this movie like the five future heroes all show up at the same abandoned mine (and other places later on) at the same time. 5. Further coincidence, autistic spectrum nerd future hero happens to have some dynamite and happens to blow up the one location on Earth with the secret crystals. 6. Rita, coincidentally, happens to be dredged up from the deep ocean after 65 my looking only slightly bent out of shape (figuratively). 7. Dumb CGI of crystals levitating and vibrating and a tiresome old hook for mystery. 8. All happen to fall into a water hole that isn't all water, but does happen to have our alien spaceship and Transformer style dinosaur bods. 9. Happens to be a dumb (but they were trying to be funny) Alpha 5 robot that speaks English and has American juvenile humor and is also 65 my old. Calls our crystals ""coins"" for some reason and reminds everyone that ""The fate of the Universe"" is in the hands of teens; also known for their poor values. 10. Writer is doing the ethnicity hook (probably to get more monied viewers) of one ethnic for each crystal, ah coin. 11. Another attempt at humor is that Rita and Goldar (made out of guess what) are looking for the ultimate crystal of life which happens to be at the ultimate source of life Krispy Kreme. 12. Final scenes with dinosaur bots, swords (all this futuristic Universe saving tech and we're still using swords?), a slap (OK!) and wrestling (wrestling??). Conclusion: Is this the future of an educated America?","1/10"

"Power Rangers","cloud-43168","22 June 2017","As a fan of the series since day one, I am excited that we got a power rangers movie its a reboot not a remake so two different things, overall these cast did amazing job, those who talk negative about the movie or series don't listen to them because they never give anything a chance, instead they should worrying about these marvel dc films. but overall its fun film with lots of Easter eggs from all the seasons. i will watch this over again. and will get a sequel. its always great to relive the moment you watch the series and always give new members a warm welcome. plus I who loves wearing these suits, so don't listen to critics and or fake fans or so cool people who complain a lot. see if you self if you like then you like it. watch as a open minded person who love the series from both Japaneses and American version,","8/10"
"Power Rangers","bestrochen","9 April 2017","I can see where they tried to make it similar, but different. However, I have not seen a movie this bad since the 3rd Spiderman Movie and Avatar The Last Air Bender live action that no one speaks of. Now I can't say its the worst cause I have seen worse, but its not worth the time to even watch it let alone pay to see in any theater. If you want something that is power rangers and okay, watch the original. The only things honestly good about the movie were their progressive inclusion of a LGBT and a young man on the Autistic spectrum. Thing is having these things does not make a movie good and though they are trying to keep their characters and ideas up today with changing culture. The movie concept was outdated to say the least and has been way overdone not just by every single series of the power rangers, but also every hero/action movie made since the 1990s. Stay at home, don't waist your money. Go watch Beauty and the Beast if anything.","9/10"

"Power Rangers","girlluver1","9 October 2018","To me this reboot of one of the worlds' most recognizable franchises is great not only to its original and new fan base but to movies as a whole. One thing I have loved about Mist if not all films is those films who make one patient for the action. One that takes time in character development, story, etc. when the rangers finally morphed it felt like I was 6 years old again watching the various power rangers series and movies. The films made one care for everyone who was tasked with being a ranger. That way when they finally have to fight Rita you feel as though you are there fighting right along side them.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","saini-aarun9","26 March 2017","I've been a huge Power Rangers fan since I was a kid, and I got to say that this movie was absolutely fantastic! It incorporates all the nostalgia that fans (such as myself) have been waiting to see! The action sequences, the cast and the CGI was all amazing and fit very well with the film's narrative and theme.Great movie! Recommend!","10/10"
"Power Rangers","thibault-li","29 July 2019","First, the characters are at least bland (Dacre Montgomery and Naomi Scott) and at worst annoying (RJ Cyler and Ludi Lin).
Elizabeth Banks who plays the villain does ham acting and looks ridiculous. She also has her share of cheesy lines and makes some very questionable choices.
Bryan Cranston is reduced as an pixel heap on a screen and came only for the paycheck I guess.
Don't expect some good characters developments, after all it's the director of Project X. Concerning direction, a lot of scenes are filmed too close to the actors.
We have to wait until lhe last fourth of the movie to finally see the heroes wearing their armours. Until then, it's quite boring. I laughed at one scene at the end of the final battle (which reminds me of Pokemon the series), then it's followed by a cringeworthy sequence which is meant to be cool, but fails I guess.Verdict : 4/10

"Power Rangers","swilliky","26 March 2017","Updated and rebooted, the Power Rangers return to the big screen with some solid actors and a new set of teens to play the colorful superheroes. Following the general premise of the original show yet slightly askew, Jason (Dacre Montgomery) was a star football player who is injured in a car accident after pulling a prank and running from the police. Sent to detention, he meets Billy (RJ Cyler), an intelligent savant who pursues the mining hobby of his deceased father and Kimberly (Naomi Scott), a trouble popular girl. Convincing Jason to help him, Billy heads to a nearby mine to blow up an area he believes hides something special. Jason tries to ditch him but runs into Kimberly and they run back after hearing Billy's explosion. Also watching from a distance is Zack (Ludi Lin) who takes care of his young mother in a nearby trailer park and Trini (Becky G.), a loner who practices yoga amidst the rocks. The five teenagers discover colorful rocks and flee the mine security only to all crash in Billy's minivan with a train. They wake up not knowing what happened with incredible strength. Meanwhile, a fishing vessel picks up a corpse that comes alive to reveal the nefarious Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks). She is on a quest to gather as much gold to build her super soldier Goldar.

"Power Rangers","franciscofernandes36","25 March 2017","First, movies do not all have to be ""dark"" or ""gore."" There is already too much darkness in the world and plenty of blood needlessly spilled. So I liked the comic tone and the energetic rhythm of the movie.In addition, a group of Power Rangers never had their personalities so exploited. The new Jason is a disgruntled hero quarterback who loves to get into trouble, the new Billy is a little genius who misses his father, the new Kimberly is a spoiled girl and plagued by a childish error, the new Zack is an impulsive shelves who is afraid of losing her mother and the new Trini is an outsider with some relationship problems. And what perfectly connect them? The loneliness that the five without exception feels in their hearts. This is the bond that unites them and forms them as a great group.We also have an introit with the story of Zordon's downfall - quite funny the way he and Jason both made mistakes as leaders - and the aiii! aai! aaai! ff Alpha 5 as comic relief.The weaker part of the film is evidently the third act and everything that concerns the villain. The suits / armor are cool and the zords too, but the villain Rita Repulsa, perhaps more for lack of script and ideas than for the demerit of the actress, does not really scare or pull our empathy. It's just one more that wants a crystal to dominate the world and the universe. Still, nothing that can not be remedied in a future sequel...However, for me, the essential thing for this film was to create a true Power Rangers team with a lot to explore in future films.And that was achieved, well done.The kids are very strong ... the power protects them.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","zoliking","18 June 2017","Rating: 1/5 What earned the film the rating: Absolute lack of any originality, banal story-line, a conflict built on unbelievable coincidence and 0 effort in trying to make any sense.Comments The characters: There is 1 character in the film, Billy. He is a shallow character whose interestingness is derived from his mental condition which is never used by the writers in any meaningful way, but at least he can pass for what we would call a character. The rest of the people in the story are vanilla clichés with less depth than graphine. The other four rangers are attempts to pander to age/gender/racial demographics, Zordon is the stereotypical pretends-to-be-a-hard-ass-but-he-really-cares mentor stereotype and Rita's entire personality begins and ends with her quest for world domination through the destruction of Earth.The performances: As you can infer from the types of characters in the film, there weren't much room given to the actors to shine the mastery of their craft, but there are two notes worth mentioning: RJ Cyler's performance of Billy pretty much single handedly made it possible to bear through this thing while surprisingly enough Elizabeth Banks's attempts at being menacing came off as comical.The plot: It starts with a pile of coincidences where Rita happens to be discovered just as exactly 5 people randomly pop upon the 5 magic ranger crystals. Then it has a flat and almost conflict free build to the final battle which is a straight up face off with no tactical nuance that ends with an giant robot pulled straight from the writer's ass. Granted, bitch slapping the villain into space could have been a bad-ass end, but the amount of randomness, silliness and emotional emptiness that surrounds that moment takes away its edge.The lack of any sense: Just a few of the major plot points that are left completely unexplained: Where do the rangers and their magic stones come from? Are there more like them in distant quadrants of space? If so, when Zordon's group disappeared, why didn't anybody come looking for the magic crystals? If not, then are the 6 of them responsible to guard every life crystal in every inhabited planet in the galaxy? If Rita can come back to life then how does being sunk in the ocean prevent her from doing so? Why did she sink in the first place? If she sank how could she have been caught up in a fishing net submerged to a depth where schools of fish swim? If Rita is the green ranger turned evil, then why are her powers completely and radically different from the others'? Why would the rangers morphing allow Zordon to come back to life? Why does it allow Billy to come back to life? Why is there a limit of 1 on coming back to life if the rangers can morph more than once? What are all the mundane authorities of the USA doing while a weird looking alien is killing people and blowing stuff up in small town America? When Rita captures the rangers what makes her spare the life of 4? How does the robots combining increase their power rather than simply limiting their mobility? If pulling the crystal unleashes a devastation of multitudinous nuclear explosions, and Rita is happy to stand in the epicenter of all that does it mean she could withstand that force?","4/10"
"Power Rangers","01rogue","12 August 2017","I expected this movie to be another kiddie show with endless, senseless fight scenes, no character development and a body count higher than all of earth's wars put together. However though, I found I could relate to and care for all of the kids and while Rita was a rather typical villain she did express true belief and feeling in her bizarre and twisted behavior.I think most of the people giving such awful reviews for this should stop and consider that sometimes movies get made for adults. Not just for marvel or dc fan-boys and text addled school kids, but for people who are mature, intelligent and have some life experience behind them.As for those who think it sends a bad message to kids, I think the opposite. I think it well portrays the fact of life that even though you have made mistakes as a teenager you are still young and capable of great and amazing comebacks. It also shows how little support for their kids modern parents have, believing themselves to be all knowing even though they clearly have no idea what's up with their own kids and in the end make everything worse. Bad parenting starts and ends at home people, get over blaming the movies and everyone else. It's you who set the standards and morals your children grow up with and if they can't watch a movie without it unbalancing their values and self belief, that's your fault.","1/10"
"Power Rangers","breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","4 July 2017","In the early 1990s, the Power Rangers TV show was a big thing when it came out. With its big action set pieces and varying evil characters to combat, many kids found the show to be a lot of fun growing up. Since then the show has continued to be superseded by different kinds of rangers. The style and execution of the show very much remained the same but the difference was in the designs and settings. Every few years seemed like a new version of the Power Rangers were being made. Prior to that, two movies were made featuring the original rangers. Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie (1995) and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie both attempted to bring about more fans but only succeeded with the first. The show was what really kept the franchise afloat. Being that it's so popular though, producers finally thought it was time to reboot the series with a brand new film. Modernization of the characters, suits, and villains were something that was bound to happen. In the end, it was alright.Seeing that this is a reboot film, the script was handled as an origin story. Written by John Gatins, audiences are introduced to a bunch of misfits that can't seem to find a break in their lives. Jason (Dacre Montgomery) is a football player who just blew is last shot at getting a scholarship for a dumb prank he tried to pull. Kim (Naomi Scott) was once a cheerleader who made an ill-fated social media post that got her in trouble. Billy (RJ Cyler) is just a book worm techie and gets caught in the wrong situations. Zack (Ludi Lin) and Trini (Becky G.) are both outsiders who try to stay as secluded as possible from the town they live in. Before they know it, they cross paths together after discovering mystical colored coins. Upon making this discovery, they then run into Alpha 5 (Bill Hader) and Zordon (Bryan Cranston), the original owners of the glowing coins. There they learn what the power rangers were all about and that an ex ranger by the name Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) must be stopped before she destroys their world.The development of the main leads are adequate. Although they make questionable decisions at first, viewers can get attached to them. The actors portraying those characters do an acceptable job. With the cast only having big name actors as the supporting roles, this gives ample time for the lesser-known thespians to shine. Out of that group, nobody takes the spotlight more than the other. They all have their moments to grow and that's always a sign the writer is thinking properly. What doesn't make sense though is that once these individuals start to train as power rangers, everyone in school treats them exactly the opposite. That's not realistically believable. On top of that Billy is a wiz at almost everything and even discovers an important plot device that Repulsa is looking for. How he finds is not explained and makes no sense. Putting that aside though, the rest of the storytelling is decent. Gatins was also the writer to Real Steel (2011), Need for Speed (2014) and Kong: Skull Island (2017).The direction was also competently controlled by Dean Israelite. What's more surprising is that Israelite had only directed one other theatrical feature which had a much smaller budget and only made twice as much back. The film was Project Almanac (2015), which was released in late January. When movies are released then, most are because they are not very good films. But all the power to Israelite for moving up. The action sequences that begin to occur around the middle of the film are well staged. Any CGI that was used in those scenes were also rendered effectively not to look fake. One of the more unique designs was to Repulsa's Goldar. Made completely of molten liquid gold, the flow of how the liquid gold moves is not seen on many creatures. The power ranger suits was another change that was done in order to not date the costume. This worked in their favor because although it's metallic armor, it looks much more durable than to that of the older style suits. Like they actually could take a beating.Camera-work for this film was a mixed bag however. Shot by Matthew J. Lloyd, the cinematography is a hybrid of shaky cam, rotating panoramic shots and traditional shooting. The classical filmmaking parts were fine; nothing to mention there. The shaky cam and rotating shots are another problem. Shaky cam is always an issue because the motions can be nauseating even if the idea is to create realism. As for the rotating shots, it can get very dizzying. Lloyd got some professional shots but anything else is nothing to be impressed with. He also filmed for Cop Car (2015) and Project Almanac (2015). Rounding out the technical elements was music composed by Brian Tyler. In the past, Tyler's music has been used for many different action films and here it sounds very stock in its own way. For some reason he doesn't translate the Power Rangers main theme but it's not all neglected. Tyler seems to have taken an alternate approach to his music. In certain areas, cues will sound close Daft Punk's sound. Interesting.Modernizing the power rangers franchise wasn't a bad idea at all. Much of the work put into this feature manages to stand out with relatively necessary development of characters. The action is permissible and the music fits the genre to a degree. The only problem is the script misses some key points and the cinematography is uneven in presentation.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","justin-fencsak","29 July 2017","When Power Rangers first came out on TV in the early 90s, no one never knew that it was an Americanized version of the Super Sentai Japanese TV shows from the 70s and 80s. Saban took footage from the series, dubbed it, and blended it in with American scenes to make a TV shows that became an icon of afternoon children's TV and spawned two movies, video games, and merchandise, not to mention controversy from politicans who thought the show was too violent. The 2017 version of this movie, coming out a few years after a Youtuber made a darker take on the show in a short film, is a perfect reboot in an age of bad reboots this decade. The casting is great, and the main villain is more sexier than the last time she was on TV. The visual effects are amazing, the soundtrack great, and the pacing of the movie is pretty good. There's also a John Hughes-esque feel in this movie, kinda similar to Spider-Man Homecoming, and there's a bonus scene after the main credits that sets up a possible sequel, which based on home media sales and rentals, might happen if Lionsgate has the money to make it.","7/10"

"Power Rangers","scottingram","26 March 2017","The new action film Power Rangers the newly rebooted film based on the hit and hugely popular 90's US TV Series about a group of teenagers superheroes who have to keep the planet Earth safe from the forces of evil starring Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks.In Power Rangers Saban's Power Rangers follows five ordinary high school kids Jason Scott (Australian actor Dacre Montgomery - Safer Neighborhood, A Few Less Men), Billy Cranston (American actor RJ Cyler - Me And Earl And The Dying Girl, US TV Series Vice Principals), Kimberly Hart (English actress Naomi Scott - The 33, TV Series Terra Nova), Asian actor Ludi Lin (TV Series Marco Polo, Monster Hunt) as Zack, American actress Becky G (US TV Series Empire, House Of Sin) as Trini who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove – and the world – is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat led by the evil Rita Repulsa (American actress Elizabeth Banks - Pitch Perfect films, Spider-Man films). Chosen by destiny by Zordon (American actor Bryan Cranston - US TV Series Breaking Bad, Total Recall 2012) who is a big talking face on a computer screen and his trusty sidekick Alpha 5 (voiced by American actor Bill Hader - Trainwreck, Men In Black 3), our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet by becoming The Power Rangers with Jason becoming the Red Ranger, Billy becoming the Blue Ranger, Kimberly becoming the Pink Ranger, Zack becoming the Black Ranger and Trini becoming the Yellow Ranger. But to do so they will have to overcome their real-life issues and band together as the Power Rangers before it is too late.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Power Rangers include American actor Matt Shively (Paranormal Activity 4, April Apocalypse) as Damo, Cody Kearsley (TV Series Riverdale) as Hawkeye, American actor David Denman (13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi, After Earth) as Sam Scott Jason's dad, Robert Moloney (Random Acts Of Romance, The Revenant) as Ted Hart Kimberly's dad, English actress of Indian descent Anjali Jay (The Age Of Adaline, Blind Dating) as Maddy Hart Kimberly's mum, Canadian actress Sarah Grey (TV Series Legends Of Tomorrow, Cinemanovels) as Amanda, Canadian actress Morgan Taylor Campbell (Sadie's Last Days On Earth, No Men Beyond This Point) as Harper, Canadian actress Caroline Cave (Saw VI, One Week) as Beverly Scott, Canadian actress Kayden Magnuson (TV Series Chesapeake Shores, Monkey Up) as Pearl Scott, Canadian actress Lisa Berry (The Colony, No Stranger Than Love) as Candace Cranston Billy's mum, John Stewart (US HorrorTV Series Fear The Walking Dead which is a spin-off of the US Horror TV Series The Walking Dead, Walking Tall) as a detention teacher, Fiona Fu (TV Series Blood And Water) as Zack's mum, English actor Garry Chalk (Godzilla 2014, Freddy vs. Jason) as Captain Bowen, Canadian actor Patrick Sabongui (TV Series The Flash and Homeland) as Trini's dad and Canadian actress Erica Cerra (TV Series The 100, Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief) as Trini's mum.Power Rangers was filmed on location in the province of British Columbia in Canada the second largest country in the world.Overall Power Rangers is a good action film filled with action, violence, shooting, fighting, battling, explosions, things getting blown up, wrecked, destroyed etc, team work, togetherness, problem troubled teenagers, sci-fi, science, incredible technology, weird bizarre things, quarries, stunning scenery, crowds of people, fall outs, disagreements, loyalty, family, friendship, on the edge of your seat stuff, waterfalls, rain, trains, cars, zords, incredible powers of strength and many other things throughout the film.So I will give Power Rangers an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Power Rangers is worth seeing if you are a fan of the Power Rangers TV Series from the 90's and the two Power Rangers films that followed suit in 1995 and 1997, Chronicle, Project Almanac, Avengers films, Transformers films, X-Men films amongst others. So if get the chance to see Power Rangers in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later and I should mention that I watched the Power Rangers TV Series from the 90's when it use to be on the TV on Sky One on the DJ Kat Show and just on its own and I was a big Power Rangers fan growing up and I was addicted to the TV Series which ran in the UK from 1994 until about 1997 which was titled Mighty Morphin Power Rangers which I watched on the TV day in day out week in week out and I had all the toy zords like the first Megazord which was made of the dino zords, the thunder zords that made up the Thunder Megazord, the ninja zords that made up the Ninja Megzord, the shogun zords that made up the Shogun Megazord, the Power Rangers figures, some of the monsters etc. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV Series ran for three seasons before it became Power Rangers Zeo which I watched in 1997 then it became Power Rangers Turbo which I watched for a bit but I couldn't get in to it and then I lost track of Power Rangers after that. But I do still have fond memories of watching Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Power Rangers Zeo but nothing the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV Series that ran for three seasons from 1994 until 1997 when Power Rangers Zeo came in to force on UK TV screens and so on.","9/10"

Each of them had a story to tell and creates an energetic flow from this reboot that creates a connection with the millennials!The only drawback was the spread of crude language in various parts, overall, it was 1/2 of the drama and 1/2 of the action! A great ticket seller for big Power Rangers fans and I thought that this was better than Beauty and The Beast!

"Power Rangers","jhaddan","20 July 2017","Warning: Spoilers! First off, I can remember when the very first episode of Power Rangers came on. I grew up with the original and following versions of Power Rangers. I loved it as did most kids I grew up with. I'll be honest; I did not want to watch the movie. Or maybe I'd watch it once it casually came out on Netflix or Hulu. However, my younger brother talked me into watching it and I wasn't disappointed. It felt like the original Power Rangers movie but they said, let's take out all the child like moments and reinsert young adult moments/reactions into, which made sense to me. After all, the power rangers where in high school. Is it a safe clean kid's movie? No, it isn't. But it made it better. Changes to the Franchise.I was on the fence about Alpha-5. He looked awkward to me. The voice didn't work for me either. I guess I was still expecting to see and hear the original Alpha-5. They could have at least left him the same. However, Zordon and Rita, being former rangers, was great. I don't remember any backstory, for them in the original show. Both were more relatable. Even though the original Rita was iconic, with her annoying voice and elaborate costume, the new Rita nailed it. Elizabeth Banks version was fantastic; completely unrecognizable. For once, it seemed Rita was in control and a total bad a**. Zordon to me, took a little time to warm up to. I did. I love how they explained why he is stuck inside the crystals and how he didn't have total faith in the new team. The rangers also had their backstory told which I thought was great. I didn't realize that until this movie; we really had not been told their story. The costumes in all the promotional material looked like crap. They honestly reminded me of the CGI effects from the original Power Rangers movie. Way too shiny! However, in the movie, they looked great. No complaints. The Zords felt like the old Zords. Still great! Overall, I think this reboot did a great job! They even snuck in the original Power Ranges theme song, lightning bolt and even set up Rita to live in outer space in the next movie; which I hope they make! Now, how anyone can give this movie one or two stars, I'm not sure. Unless they were paid to do so. I'll give this nine stars because they kept intact the original, iconic material, while making it more grown up which is essentially all any Power Ranger fan wanted. Just take the cheesy-ness out of SABANS Power Rangers and make it more real. Watch it and enjoy the movie for what it is.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","classicsoncall","18 April 2017","For me personally, this was a movie choice of last resort with my two pre-teen grand kids tagging along. We had to whittle down our selection to a film no one had seen yet. So I missed out on The Smurfs and Boss Baby once again; maybe that wasn't such a bad idea. Anyway, this is not a picture I would have gone to under any other circumstances, and there's no obligatory admission here that it was better than what I thought it would be. The entire story is aimed directly at the teenage market with a rainbow coalition of characters that's even referenced by someone in the story as being 'different colors, different kids, different colored kids'. So the whole multiculturalism aspect is addressed here, with a nod to the idea that autism doesn't have to be a hindrance for someone who wants to be productive and make a difference. In fact, it was the autistic teen Billy (RJ Cyler) who first attained the morphing ability crucial to the teens acquiring their Power Ranger status. With a threat to the planet and a villainess bent on global domination, the latter part of the picture turned into a garish display of battle action and destruction on a scale meant to outdo the last movie that just came out, take your pick. The young teens win out naturally, with their message of misfits sticking together for a worthwhile cause. If you catch your fair share of super-hero flicks, you've already seen it dozens of times. For this viewer, I couldn't even count on a nostalgia factor in watching this film; even though the first Power ranger vehicle came out in 1993, my roots go all the way back to ""The Adventures of Superman"" from the Fifties. I guess I'll stick with the DC and Marvel films looking ahead.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","destroyerwod","27 August 2018","So i decided i was gonna go full spoiler for this review cause lets face it, if you watched the show in the 90s you already know what Power Rangers is. I would like to start by the negatives and finish on the positives. So first of all i am not a fan of the race swapping they did for the main characters. I supose its to please the SJWs and commit to our ""political correctness era"" wich i am not fond of, but in the end it just make the movie a bit weird without a good reason. So right out the bat Jason and Kimberly are done right. There a bit more flawed than the show happy goodies version, but they are close enough. The problem comes with the yellow, blue and black rangers that they race swapped. So basically Billy is now african-american, Zack is asian and Trini is hispanic. Its kinda funny how they mention Jason, Kim and Billy's last name but never do it for Zack or Trini. Lets just say Trini Kwan does not sound very hispanic and Zack Taylor does not sound very asian either. When it comes to Billy his genius persona is kept but for Zack and Trini they go opposite direction. Now i think changing them a bit to make a more original movie is fine, but they didn't need to race swap them for that. Zack could had still be african-american and act differently. Anyway rant on this is over. When it comes to the other changes like for instance having Zordon as the original Red Ranger and Rita as the original Green Ranger, i think it worked very fine. The movie set up a possible sequel to introduce Tommy and they could do the geen ranger saga perfectly that way. Rita's new appearance didn't bother me either. On the other hand i wish Goldar would had been closer to the show version, as in a monster in a gold armor instead of just a faceless gold monster. Also another issue i had with the movie was that despite being called Power Rangers, they barely are in the suits only for the final act and most of it happen in the Zords. I would had love to see more hand to hand fights in there power suits and maybe show there unique weapons for all Rangers and not just Jason. But despite all i just said, actually the movie is fairly entertaining. I wish i would had seen more ""rangers"" but the character developement and the bonding between the characters was actually handle well. Instead of being all friends like at the beginning of the old show, they are all different and come together due to circonstances. They get to know each other with time and develop there friendship and eventually realize they need each others. I enjoyed that aspect. The final act was also very well done, i love seeing the Zords fight individually as we saw very few of that in the show. The new Megazord was cool too. In the end i actually had more fun than i tough i would with the movie and despite my negatives wich seem bigger than the positives in this review, i would rate the movie positively. As a fan of the show i actually enjoyed the new looks of the rangers(even if so few of them), the new zords/megazord, Ritas and even Alpha wich i was not fond of in the first promo photos, i think he came out very ok in the movie. I really hope they eventually do a sequel. Especially since they set it so well. I recommand that you watch this with a few beers tough (if you are of age obviously) and it made me got more into the movie that i think i would if i didn't drank.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","oscaralbert","29 March 2017",". . . ""Krispy Kreme's"" logo seems to be on-screen during POWER RANGERS for more than an hour. The main villain of this flick is shown chowing down on one of the featured KK (or is it ""KKK""?) donuts an hour, 37 minutes, and 25 seconds into this yawner. (When's the last time that you've enjoyed a GOOD movie in which a main character lingered over a pastry that close to the climax? About the only Dunker Scene of note in the Annals of Film was the infamous shootout in BOOGIE NIGHTS, and that comes at the beginning of the show.) If I want to spend an hour at Krispy Kreme, I'll drive to one. However, I'm not so sure I'll venture over there again in the foreseeable future, because my last three trips saw me arriving with KK's logo lit up, which means my car load expected the promised ""free"" treat each time. Tragically, ""fancy"" filled donuts were rolling off KK's assembly line in each instance, and they say that they will only give away the ""original glazed"" ones for Gratis when their sign is lit up! In the field of Consumer Fraud, this is what's known as a ""Bait and Switch"" Gimmick. Anyone suffering this apparently typical KK experience must boycott BOTH Krispy Kreme AND Power Rangers!","3/10"
"Power Rangers","adam111111","28 June 2017","I was expecting very, very little from this movie. In addition to the Michael Bay-style CGI extravaganza that I was thinking was going to be there, there was also a great deal of other stuff going on, like some stock-issue teenage drama and extensive promotional materials from Krispy-Kreme. That last note was particularly weird, and the fact that the secret to preserving the entire earth was under a Krispy-Kreme. Incidentally, there were at least three extended shots of people gleefully eating doughnuts from, where else, Krispy-Kreme.This is not a particularly original movie. It does not stretch the limits of film as art, nor is it particularly funny or exciting. It is a solid movie though, and one that is worth watching, if offered.","5/10"
"Power Rangers","joexrayguy","25 March 2017","I was not a fan of the original series and only went to take my son to it. It was great. Like I said, not a fan, the series missed my demographic when it came out but I knew the gist of it. The movie gives some back story as to how the Rangers came to Earth and also to the individual characters which gave the movie some heft. The Rangers alter egos have personality instead of the squeaky clean drones on the TV show. Also, hits all the buttons-training sequence, bonding scenes, slow mo hero walk (I think we get two). Brian Cranston has a good, almost cameo, essentially a face on a wall thru' the movie. Violent fights but no blood and the characters stop just short of vulgar language, had no problem letting my son watch. Only two gripes that suspension of belief can handle- 1)a being come from another galaxy and her name is Rita Repulsive? 2)a Ranger fights Rita in a bedroom at night, and no parents run into the room?","6/10"
"Power Rangers","jameschin","22 March 2017","Naomi Scott or Kim in the movie was just amazing!Some scenes didn't make sense like why these kids were bullied when some of them were good enough to be bullies xD. Well I am not a big fan of PR due to those old TV show action scenes but this was better than expected. Although some scenes were cringy (no spoilers) and the monsters could've been different (like the gold one) and more presentable, it was still good to see.... now i don't know if the monsters were like that originally (cause, not a fanboy) but the main villain could've fought better for someone who took down tougher rangers. And if ur complaining on how they react and adapt to their new powers, well there isn't a better way to do it!","2/10"
"Power Rangers","Mike_Devine","31 March 2018","Long ago, the Power Rangers were an insanely popular force to be reckoned with. Nowadays, they're only really good for 30-something fanboys who are feeling nostalgic, despite the fact that there have been iterations upon iterations of series developed to keep interest alive.In 2017's 'Power Rangers,' Lionsgate aimed to recharge the aging franchise by injecting young up-and-coming actors and a healthy dose of CGI in the hopes of capturing success a la 'Transformers.' Unfortunately, the quality here fell way short of expectations, with cheesy dialogue, cheap action sequences and poor acting. From an acting perspective, the young troupe of actors deliver boring performances as misfit teenagers turned quasi-superheroes. The only real bright spot is Elizabeth Banks' portrayal of the alien witch Rita Repulsa, who has been reimagined to be a fierce killer bent on destroying Earth. The vocal talents of Bryan Cranston (as Zordon) and Bill Hader (as Alpha 5) are pretty much throwaways and don't amount to much here,Another flaw in 'Power Rangers' is its pacing. The film starts out very slow, then seems to sprint through the rest of the sequence of events in the blink of an eye. The little character development that happens is focused on the imperfections of each ranger's life and why they want to escape their struggles for something better. Sure, it's fair to say there are a lot of social and societal lessons and commentaries baked into 'Power Rangers,' but these do nothing to elevate the film as a whole. Even the final moments of the climactic battle are underwhelming.While credit is probably due for making another attempt to breathe life into 'Power Rangers,' the execution here is poor. When it comes to making movies about well-established pop culture subjects, that really hurts.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","danielharden","1 April 2017","Based on Haim Saban's campy, B movie styled kids show, comes an attempt at a more realistic and darker (in colour) version of the Power Rangers. Directed by Dean Israelite and starring RJ Cyler, Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks, this Power Rangers movie tries to be different and have substance, distancing itself from the campy fun of the original Rangers. But the end result is quite bland and cliché with few new aspects working.The best part of this film by far is RJ Cyler's performance as Billy, an autistic boy who lost his dad and who becomes the Blue Ranger. Following his brilliant role as Earl in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Cyler is yet again likable and funny but in a completely different way. Billy is the only ranger you particularly care for and I credit this to Cyler's great performance.While on this topic it's worth noting that the other ranger's don't act particularly badly, they just aren't given much to work with. Red Ranger Jason and Pink Ranger Kimberly are really bland characters and unfortunately they get the most screen time. These characters are nothing more than archetypal straight couple leads in many a film before this, and won't be remembered in any way after the credits role. Also Zack and Trini feel as if they are only there for the sake of numbers, they are given a bit of development but they are clearly ranger number 4 and 5.As well as their being good acting on display by RJ Cyler, there is also some below average acting in this film mainly by Elizabeth Banks. Elizabeth Banks plays antagonist Rita Repulsa in a rather over the top performance. Although being loyal to the source material by doing this, it does however go against the more grounded and realistic approach this film aimed for, and thus the conflict between whether the film should be more realistic or unrealistic begins.For the majority of this film it focuses on the bonding of the Rangers. This could have been done a lot better if the characters written were more compelling. This is also why I rate RJ Cyler's performance so highly, because he had to carry the majority of the film for me. The best scene in the film was the campfire scene as we actually get offered some substance, but unfortunately it trails off when it gets to our two boring leads. Zack, Trini and Billy are given a moment that allows the audience to engage with them whereas Jason and Kimberly remain boring by being tight lipped and this annoyed me.Once Morphed the film takes a nose dive, descending into a cheesy final act with some less than stellar visual effects. The visual effects didn't fit in with the real surroundings at all and made the film look fake and cheap. Also I have to mention the world's most subtle product placement that Krispy Kremes was given. If you aren't laughing right now then you clearly haven't seen the film. The product placement for Krispy Kremes is almost as bad as McDonald's in Mac and Me. There may not be a dance number in a Krispy Kreme, but Rita does take a break from the action to enjoy a good old donut.Overall, Power Ranger's is contradictory in what it wants to be. Director and studio obviously had different ideas, but in the end the studio won as evidenced by Krispy Kreme's role in the film. With a strong performance by RJ Cyler and no one else, the film struggled to keep me engaged even though attempts were made to make the film interesting. Now set up for a sequel as all blockbusters are nowadays and all I can say is, ""NO NO POWER RANGERS!""","1/10"

"Power Rangers","tyleramato-28680","25 March 2017","""Power Rangers"" is yet another product of Hollywood's reboot machine which aims to take something silly and turn it into something grounded and gritty, but if you're gonna take something in a more serious direction, you damn well better stick to it, and tonally ""Power Rangers"" is a gigantic, if not somewhat enjoyable mess that tries to bite off more than it can chew. Power Rangers' biggest draw is easily its young and talented cast of colorful characters, including the once High School Football prodigy turned hooligan, Jason Scott played by Dacre Montgomery, the socially awkward Billy Cranston played by RJ Cyler, the mysterious Trini played by Becky G, the reckless Zack played by Ludi Lin, and resident bad girl, Kimberly Hart played by Naomi Scott. The five young actors have instant chemistry together and all have something different to offer to the film, Bryan Cranston also turns in a fantastic portrayal of Zordon, Bill Hader provides solid voice work for Alpha 5, and Elizabeth Banks chews up the scenery as main baddie Rita Repulsa, whose diabolical plan is to build a giant monster out of...gold? Called Goldar? To find a crystal buried under a Krispy Kreme in the town of Angel Grove? Sounds grounded and serious, doesn't it? And yes, you heard right, Krispy Kreme is an integral part to the film...totally not joking here, folks. It's a shame how well the first half of the film worked in contrast to its second half, but that's what happens when you have five different people working on the script. Cliché as it may seem but more truly is less in the case of ""Power Rangers"".","8/10"
"Power Rangers","minionking777","30 June 2017","I was a child of the nineties, and as such, I loved the power rangers and wanted to be one. (I still want to be one!) This reboot takes all the vital elements of the original power rangers and gives them creative depth and meaning. All the kooky cheesiness was replaced by realism and plausibility. This movie adds the ""why"" and ""how"" to all the ""what."" The characters (rangers) are more like real people than the original goody-goodies of old. Rita's and Goldar's reinvention is nothing short of art. I worried that this movie would deviate too far or in the wrong way, but it made all the right moves. Don't listen to the trolls and haters; this movie rocked! I desperately hope for sequels!(In short, it's like going from Adam West's Batman to Christian Bale's Batman.)","4/10"

In my opinion, this film was no different than movies like ""Captain Marvel"" or ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"".C+","7/10"
"Power Rangers","Noahflanny","23 March 2017","I didn't come in to this film expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised when the film began with a very nice start. The build-up and introduction of the first few characters was very well paced and I started to become more interested in the movie, even if it was a generic ""outcast is special"" scenario. Unfortunately, just as I was starting to gain interest, the film started to lose its speed. As I mentioned before, the first few rangers introduced were done very well, and I even felt a bit invested in these characters. The remaining rangers, however, seemed to be awkwardly shoved into the plot. With little to no background given other then that they just happened to be in the right place at the right time with the other characters. The acting was also not that great in some areas either. Especially Dacre Montgomery as the Red ranger. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't a horrible pick for the leading ranger, he just could have done better in some moments. You can definitely pick out the times when the acting was very poor. Another thing to note is that the pacing felt off at times. The first half was set up very nicely, with good introduction to the world we were being introduced too, but what the film does wrong after that is it takes the audience's new knowledge of this world and shoves the climax of the film in our face. One second the protagonists are on their knees clearly defeated with no real answer on how to win, and then, in what feels like less than a minute or two, they're an unstoppable force that no one can defeat. My friends and I were laughing the entire duration of the climax, it was just so ridiculous and off paced we couldn't help it. Overall, not the greatest movie. I could go more in depth about the action and antagonist but that just reaffirms what I already said. I will admit that the film it had its good and funny moments, especially the first half. Go see it if you've got nothing else to do and want to laugh at some corny jokes. Otherwise I'd recommend seeing or doing something else with your free time and wait till it hits redbox.","4/10"
"Power Rangers","TharsheyN","26 July 2021","So before I even start my review I will say that I've never watched anything Power Rangers before. The most I'd seen is maybe an episode or two of the show when I was like 8 years old.The movie starts off pretty interesting though it does take a bit long before any of the action. However I don't mind this at all, as they take time to setup the world and the characters and I would honestly not have minded another 30m or so off world building and character building if they had gone that route.The storyline is nothing special and is pretty basic, however what brings me back to this movie every time, and I've watched it like 5 times now, is the relationship that's built between the Rangers. It's the best part of the film and each time I watched the film seeing the Rangers becoming friends and then family is really amazing. The best performance while everyone did do a good job goes hands down to A. J. Cyler aka Billy Cranston. He does an amazing job with his role and steals the spotlight every time.I know there was a general hint at the red ranger and pink ranger aka Naomi Scott and Dacre Montgomery having a romantic relationship at some point. However it was mostly cut from the film besides the slow building of their relationship throughout the film. However I disagree and actually would prefer to see Dacre/Red Ranger do his whole solo leader stint and allow Billy and Kimberly to get together... I know probably everyone reading this will disagree and that's fine but that's how much I liked the Blue Ranger/Billy.The rest of the cast as said before do admirable jobs and the special effects while not anything mind blowing are also pretty great.All in all the movie is fun to watch and I'll be rewatching it soon as well, just because I like the family (laughs in Dominic Torreto) dynamic they have going on between the Rangers, even I I don't agree on all the relationships they try to set up.8/10 from me and if you're a fan of the old PR series I wouldn't recommend this to you if you thinking nostalgia before watching, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to see a Power Rangers reboot or Origin story as this is pretty much what it is!","4/10"
"Power Rangers","TheMovieDiorama","11 March 2018","The attempted reboot of another franchise...that no one asked for. In a decade where Marvel rules the saturated superhero genre, there is no requirement for more especially when it's filled with mediocrity. Having no prior knowledge to the 'Power Rangers' franchise, this is a review strictly critiquing the film alone. Five students come across strange coins that lead to an underground spaceship eventually granting them the abilities of Power Rangers. They must learn to work together as a unit in order to prevent evil forces from destroying Earth. Now, let's whip out the old ""Superhero Check List"". Ready? Alright, here we go. Origin story (or stories) where the main character(s) must harness their new found ability? Check. Evil villain wanting to destroy the world for no apparent reason? Oh yes. A CGI disposable army? Yup, rock monsters this time! Leaving the story open for countless sequels? Naturally. There is not a single original idea, even when using such rich source material. It borrows elements from various other films and unfortunately does nothing inventive with them. Four bland protagonists and one who actually has some personality (the blue ranger, but you knew that anyway) lead a boring story filled with clichés and a formulaic structure. There's a moment where our characters sit down and say ""let's get to know each other"" as if the script forces character development right before your eyes. No natural progression, it's all artificial nonsense. I did like the design of the morphing suits and the advanced technology made for some inventive gadgetry. Although, for such an expensive film I'm surprised that the visual effects were frequently poorly executed. Obvious green screen was obvious. The constant use of slow motion was jarring, particularly during combat scenes. And then we get to the antagonist...ohhhh Elizabeth Banks. What are you doing here? A pantomime villain who's motives are not explored, just destroying the world because why not! What can I say except the film is unnecessary.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","Oberrated","25 March 2017","I was hyped to see this movie. My childhood was going to be relived with this new take on the original series and to be honest, I was pretty satisfied with what I saw by the time the movie came to an end. Characters I loved in new form, a dope new style of armor (which has been hotly debated but how is that a turning point for a movie being bad or not? P*** off), and quite an entertaining bit of material throughout the film in regards to comedy and action. So no doubt, 'Power Rangers' was an entertaining film from my perspective. However, everything was not all rainbows and butterflies. The story progression was sporadic throughout the film. I felt as if the film had a hard time balancing the whole serious tone and the imminent Earth's destruction between the OhEmGee teen drama that was supposed to instill a deep emotional heart-string pluck (although I did feel for Zack (Ludi Lin) the Black Ranger because I'm a mommas boy). Let us also not forget the music video film constantly blaring out mainstream tunes at inopportune moments. Sorry, the last thing I want to listen to is Kanye West's ""Power"" while an intense battle scene is going on.So beyond all that and other personal gripes I had with the film, I do want to bring focus to the characters. I had no previous knowledge of any of the actors and actresses besides Becky G (Trini/Yellow Ranger) being a musician and me loving RJ Cyler (Billy/Blue Ranger) in the film 'Me, Earl, and the Dying Girl'. RJ Cyler easily stole the show. From the moment he entered the screen, I loved every moment of his screen time... Discount Zac Efron aka Dacre Montgomery (Jason/Red Ranger) was a solid player in the film. I was not entirely thrilled with his role of the leader but I hope to see better from him with the expected coming sequels... Naomi Scott and Ludi Lin (Kimberly/Pink Ranger and Zack/Yellow Ranger) were average for me. I was not a fan of Kimberly's story and Zack was a bit of annoyance but they were nothing perspective altering for me... Lastly, Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa was actually impressive for me. I enjoyed her quirky persona and was actually shocked by the way they presented her at times through almost a horror type way. Very cool for me... Again, overall, solid cast choice and performance for an intro film.-- Oberrated.com --","5/10"
"Power Rangers","arungeorge13","28 June 2017","The new 'Power Rangers' film has the look and feel of a mixed bag. It tries to cram too much into an origin story which is characterized by unlikable high-schoolers who happen to meet at detention. There is absolutely zero chemistry amongst the Rangers just as Jason the Red Ranger keeps blurting all through the first three quarters of the film. The dialogues are the textbook definition of 'cheesy', while the characters themselves believe they're wise-cracking. Not a good sign if you ask me. PG-13 rating ensures negligible usage of cuss words and gore-free CGI violence. The last act appears like a Transformers rip-off. Ugly-looking stone monsters fighting it out with bots in the town centre in a badly-choreographed setpiece with some absolutely outrageous twists thrown in. Of course, I don't mean to underestimate the current generation of teens but this flick simply caters to a really small audience. None of the characters (barring maybe Billy's) even manage to evoke the slightest bit of interest (or amusement!). A short scene where they all sit down around a fire detailing some of their personal secrets was in fact one of the few redeeming factors. There needed to be plenty more Easter eggs than just the famous Power Rangers theme being played during the climax set-piece. The CGI itself looks lacklustre for a 100 million $ venture. The narrative is so jumbled and the tone literally all over the place for this film to be treated as a solid 'Power Rangers' reboot. Elizabeth Banks (under a truckload of make-up) looks bizarre and seems miscast for the character of Rita Repulsa, whose costumes appear to be unintentionally hilarious.The writing goes haywire from the moment the group discovers the spaceship and encounters Zordon, the previous Red Ranger. More light should have been shed on individual character weaknesses before moving on to bigger things like preparing to become 'Rangers' all of a sudden (just because some entity in a spaceship tells them that they're designated world-protectors!). The training scenes are a mess. Performances aren't exactly stuff to write home about. This film positions itself as harmless popcorn fun and nothing more. Sigh!","4/10"
"Power Rangers","asifahsankhan","2 June 2017","Whenever Hollywood attempts to reboot a beloved, preexisting property on the big screen, it always feels more or less reconstructed in a way to be more accessible for all kinds of audiences, and less specific than the original incarnation may have ever been. The best thing that can be said about 2017's Power Rangers then - Saban and Lionsgate's new attempt at bringing the iconic title back to life as a large scale blockbuster - is that it doesn't ever feel like it betrays the core values of the Power Rangers franchise.First things first: Elizabeth Banks. She all but guarantees ""Power Rangers"" will not quite be yet another CGI special-effects franchise nostalgia superhero extravaganza. In her characterisation of alien vileness Rita Repulsa, she goes far, far over the tipsiest of tops, showing splendid awareness of how far-beyond-stoop-id the movie is.That's a complicated way of saying Rita has no eyebrows, and acts like people with no eyebrows in movies often do, i.e., a total meanie.Bless Banks for cutting a campy swath through a movie that very much needs it. Otherwise, ""Power Rangers"" is a mess, unsure whether it should be a kitschy throwback romp or ultramodern emo-reboot. A person could pull a groin jerking from tone to tone. I will say the film's visual palette, a convincing blend of CGI and practical effects, is distinctive, ambitious and sometimes impressively weird. It's just too bad such creativity is at the service of this dumb movie. For an early action sequence, director Dean Israelite (""Project Almanac"") employs a swivelling POV camera in the back of a speeding truck; employing this type of virtuoso technique for a ""Power Rangers"" movie is akin to carving SpongeBob SquarePants from a block of Italian marble.The film begins auspiciously, with a subtitle reading ""PLANET EARTH: CENOZOIC ERA,"" and Bryan Cranston grunting impenetrable dialogue from behind heavy alien makeup. I steeled myself for the worst. It gets worse before it gets better: Cut to the modern day (what, no subtitle reading ""65 MILLION YEARS LATER""?), when small-town high- school football star Jason (Dacre Montgomery) admits to milking a cow, although he didn't realise it was actually a bull until he examines its undercarriage, its genitalia photographed in disturbing close-up.So immediately, this ""Power Rangers"" establishes its audience as grown-up kids who played with the toys and watched the television show in the 1990s, not the eight-year-oldies currently trawling the Target aisle for branded laser swords. Notably, it's also rife with scenes of pervasive violence, a criticism frequently levied at the ""Power Rangers"" franchise in its heyday of popularity. But in that sense, it's similar to the recent ""Transformers"" and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movies, which also reconfigured youth-culture franchises into ugly displays of digital Noe-realist carnage. Power Rangers likely won't do much for those who never liked the property in the first place. But for those who grew up with it, or found it through the many different incarnations throughout the years, it provides the kind of passionate, loving reboot that we very rarely see from the studio system nowadays - one that goes deeper into its mythology without ever losing the camp element that made it so much fun in the first place. While it doesn't quite pull off everything it wants to, but it's a fun time at the theatre nonetheless.","5/10"
"Power Rangers","akilianetc-23277","28 June 2018","As Zordon said, only find those who are worthy and strong. So I think the cast did a great job at portraying that with this modern updated storyline. I remember watching the original TV series when it first debut as I was just a kid then. I felt like the chemistry between all of them could have been a little more natural but in the end it's about being a team and only 2 hours doesn't do so much justice to that.

"Power Rangers","siderite","10 August 2020","I have not grown up with the Power Rangers and so I don't have any melancholy towards the story or the characters. I can only imagine it was a children's action series or something. I expected the script to be idiotic, but I also hoped for something fun. There was nothing fun, inspiring or funny about the whole thing. In fact, it was totally depressing. I almost empathized with the psychotic villain because everything else was so boring, bland or nonsensical.Watching a Hollywood movie based on superheros that sucks was not unexpected. Using actors like Dacre Montgomery, who did a good job in Stranger Things, for a character jumping around in pointless stunts while having no shred of personality was a crime, though. Putting Elizabeth Banks in the role of the villain opened up so many different potential doors; they closed and locked them all with a character so unidimensional that it hurt. She did a good job with it, too, perhaps just to spite them. And finally, Bryan Cranston, Mr Breaking Bad himself, the ranger (ironically) who sacrificed himself to end the Shadow War... as a face in a wall acting like a sporting couch.This film deserves no praise, not even anger, just pity and oblivion.","1/10"
"Power Rangers","MinistryofDoom","29 June 2017","The Jock, the Nerd, the Outcast, the New Girl, the Edgy Loner....stuck in detention hell for the rest of the year, forced to put up with each other and learn that they each are more than their stereotype, as the become more self-confident and joint together to become (cue fanfare)...THE POWER RANGERS. This film goes into great detail explaining each of the main characters and their person struggles, mostly about being misunderstood by their parents or society. However,....they coincidentally happen to be at the same location at the very same time on the very same day to discover that they were chosen to be the Power Rangers. How convenient.This film is 3/4th teen angst drama and 1/4th super hero action. While it goes to great lengths to explain each character's backstory, when the action superhero portion of the film starts, it fails to feel the urgency of the conflict that they are made to resolve. It doesn't explain who the villains are or where they came from or who the Power Rangers' mentor is for that matter. The most that we're given is a few blurbs here and there. The actual costumed Power Rangers in all their colorful glory do not even show up until very late in the film.In this regard, it feels like the Director isn't sure if his aim was to create a standalone superhero action film or a two hour segue into an inevitable Power Rangers sequel. While most of the performances are OK, Brian Cranston as the voice of Zordon and Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa stand out. Banks in particular is every bit as crazy and demented as you'd expect Rita Repulsa to be. To be honest, I was skeptical when I heard that she was up for the role. The only performances I've seen of hers were in Judd Apatow- style comedies but rest assured than in Power Rangers, she really delivers.For those in doubt, this film definitely takes it's cues from the campy TV show of the 90s. There's a big emphasis on ""morphin' time"" and certain characters and references taken directly from the show indicate that the writers and director were definitely trying to woo the dedicated fans of this brand.In the end, it's not a bad movie. It just seems a little confused about what it wants to be and that confusion ultimately hurts this reboot.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","Bosco-HK","26 March 2017","I grew up watching Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers!

Despite as much as having some cultural diversity, with the actors and actresses representing, the attempt to portray ""physique"" was probably too tough when comparing to what I remember from the Original 1993-96 TV Series.The next favorite of all the characters, is Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks).What I mean by ""physique"" is not just trying to match ""body type"" to be just like the Original 1993 series. Over the course of training, we can see that Kimberly (Naomi Scott) showed more ""artistry"" and ""put effort in training"" from her ""cool tough shoulder-to-headshot"" which I really liked. I think it is due to Kimberly, bringing out her gymnastic background to show signs of physique or an all-around athlete. And even Trini was the next quick learner even though she was the one to show her speed in climbing from the side effects (a reference to Sabretooth), and then Kimberly caught up and even beat Zack to the top. Most likely intentional that the ladies were presented to be better than the guys (yet to see their stories for physique), which gets my thumbs up!This is not a con of the movie but the ability to do that ""huge leap"" was a little bit awkward but a reference to ""Superman/Hulk/Spiderman/etc""? I must say though, portraying the two ladies (both Trini and Kimberly) to be awesome at their landing. I laughed at the three guys who had their ""trouble"" with their ""leap"".I like how though that ""the battle phases"" were short sticking true that good vs evil, it is always ""practically easy for the good"" to win. However, as far as ""origins"" or ""starting from fresh"", I think the battle phases could be longer or put more difficulty. We cannot forget about cameos! Amy Jo Johnson (Kimberly/Pink) and Jason David Frank (Tommy/Green/White, or later Red and ""Professor"" at one point in each respective TV series).On the other side, Elizabeth Banks as Rita, indeed quite marvelous. Of course, her tag line ""Make My Monster Grow"" was included in an okay fashion but I guess the original was just an exaggeration and ""perhaps the final decision"" was just to go with ""a literal aspect?""---Cons:I feel like the cons in any review should first be reviewed based on the limitations of movie length. By that, movies have been gradually reduced in duration, now almost all of them vary between 1 hour 20 minutes and 2 hour 20 minutes, or otherwise taken to ""Part 2"" rather than ""sequel"".Before I really go ""in somewhat order of occurrence"", I guess they tried to do it like you know ""when after several episodes you don't really need to see the entire Megazord transformation"", this 2017 reboot did that for the ""Go Go Power Rangers..."" song. I was actually very happy that they brought it in but then decided to use ""a technique in TV Series"" rather than playing the entire thing out and jump ""almost straight into action"" which is another film technique. Still, I would have preferred to have heard the entirety of the song, since they obviously took out the ""cheesy Morphin'"" with the ""Morphers"" or ""some sort of hand-held equipment to morph"". Another very notable downfall was ""using techniques"" to save a life. I think I don't have to say much more about that. This is before going back to HQ.What I felt was ""the meeting of characters was too rushed at the ""Saturday detention"". Detention, I believe it is a reference to ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985), by all means not even close, I found ""The Slap"", extremely funny, clearly girly for an outstanding quarterback (QB).I understand that each character was showcased in a rather stereotypical manner from the beginning, I still think we can have more character focus. Perhaps, kept for sequels to tie in ""friendship"" or ""history of connection"" for future characters who will become Rangers or ""fit for being a Ranger because they were, for example, training partners or like a father's friend's son or like someone who long disappeared or that they left behind after ""moving"".Back to the battle phases, perhaps length-limiting though unsure, ""the discovery of combining into the Megazord"" was ""way too rushed"" just as they are about to lose. And then that ""backdrop suplex?"", not a ""special move"" at all but simply from ""training"", as ""the surprise factor"" over an opponent now wielding a long-reach weapon. Anyway, for better or worse, all the ""cheesy"" stuff made it ""rather adolescent"" resulting to a ""degrading effect"" in terms of ""what is known with a reboot"". From ""The Slap at Detention"", to ""Trini's water bottle"", to at the very end where Rita exclaimed ""How?!"" was extra comical, bringing back the exaggeration lost in ""Make My Monster Grow"", perhaps ""The Second Slap"" turned out to reference ""why Rita and Gang were to be at the Moon Palace""?I think it is good to stop here, to avoid seeming as though I am a 110%- perfect writer or director. I hope some of you may find the above long- windedness ""up to standard"".","6/10"

"Power Rangers","tommy-97761","12 July 2022","Let's be honest, the original series was cheesy and seeing an episode as an adult makes me cringe a bit, but yet it was fun and it was kind of cool from the point of view of a child. The movie tries to play it safe an is thus an utter bore with nothing to offer. Given the current overload of various CGI heavy productions, I doupt this has any merit for a newcommer, yet the movie doesn't really lean into nostalgia, fun or CHEESE to make it fun for the now adult audience. My rating might be harsh, as there is nothing really offensive about the movie but it is a waste of your time. It has nothing to offer at all and I have no idea who was it made for?","8/10"

"Power Rangers","andrewcreer","24 March 2017","Power Rangers struggles for two major reasons: The movie takes too long to find its feet, and it tries a little too hard to include embarrassing levels of teenage angst. It is understandable that after being renewed for FIVE sequels - that some background set-up is required, and trying to establish character background would be important (although this film falls far short of making the characters have any emotional pull).When the movie finally gets rolling - that is when fans of the franchise can sit back, and really enjoy the show. For those who are seeing this movie as long-time fans of the Rangers - get ready for the nostalgia trip of your life. As a fan of the series, I left this movie satisfied and smiling after the final forty five minutes of pure enjoyment. If you are willing to look passed some of the very apparent flaws of this film, it is overall a very enjoyable experience.","9/10"

"Power Rangers","burningphoenix36","29 July 2017","What I loved about this movie was how it was not an exact replica of the original pilot just as a cheap cash grab, it had a new story that was completely different from the original. It had many scenes to bring nostalgia while still doing what a reboot should do, reboot it in a completely different way. The interesting and heavy/dark take on it made it perfect for teenagers today. It's definitely not for kids, and adults who loved the original series will not like this movie because it is nothing like the original, and is oversexualized and too heavy for the fun loving original story. However it's not for that demographic either. The demographic this story is speaking to and meant for is middle schoolers and high schoolers who watched the show when they were kids, such as myself. The topics and struggles every characters goes through are true to the struggles of everyday teens in this day and age. So saying this movie ruins the original or isn't kid friendly, it's kind of a no brainer, because it's telling a new more relevant story for teens who struggle with these issues all the time. This is why I loved it and felt this movie spoke to me. I feel this movie is a must watch for those who are in their teenage years. Of course the movie had flaws as all movies do but this movie is a great reboot for the next generation.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","peterfbrand","31 July 2020","I do not know why this movie has been rated so low!!! It's The Power Rangers! It's going to be a little cheesy. I loved how it includes all the various ethnicities and the character who's ""on the spectrum"" my son loved that and it fits really well.
A great feel good movie, great acting, great specials effects, great story line, i loved the extra cheese towards the end with the ""Go-Go Power Rangers bit""
I really believe most of the bad ratings for this movie were from people who have no idea what The Power Rangers was.
Brilliant movie. I HOPE they make a sequel. The lead reminds me of a young Zack Efron.

"Power Rangers","mhorg2018","12 January 2018","Take a huge budget. Add in a cast of unremarkable, paint by numbers actors (I use that lightly, although Dacre was way better in Stranger things 2), a dialed in script (How the hell did they get Bryan Cranston to be in this? Guess he needed some extra dough). As usual in this kind of crummy movie, make the villain (Elisabeth Banks steals every scene she's in) the most memorable character and end it with a hoped for sequel that, due this one falling with a resounding thud, will likely never get made.

"Power Rangers","p-jonsson","31 May 2017","Buying this movie was of course pretty much a request from my kids although I have to confess that I, as a Science Fiction geek, was at least a tiny bit interested in seeing what they had managed to cook together on a big budget. For the record I find the television show absolutely awful. Therefore I am quite surprised that I found the movie to be not exactly good but at least watchable.Make no mistake, it is indeed a silly and simple plot, teenage wet dream, stupid and illogical kind of story that you would expect. However, it was actually mildly fun to watch. Most of my enjoyment came from the special effects and action sequences of course. The dialog and behavior of the teenage heroes were as stereotyped and generally awful as one would expect.This of course means that the first half of the movie is less interesting than the second half when the action picks up. Actually, although there are some fun moments during ""training"", I felt this entire idea of them not being able to use their powers before they had gotten into the right ""mental state"" to prove that they were actually Power Rangers was just a rubbish one.Once things started to pick up speed it became more interesting. The different means of transport of the Power Rangers was absolutely silly but still great fun to watch.Well, I really do not have that much more to say. The last parts of the movie was one big special effects feast with a few comic elements in it, most of them rather  teenage. Fun to watch for a science fiction geek like me.So, the verdict? Was it a fun movie to watch? Yeah, it was pretty okay. Was it a good movie? Well, that is probably stretching it.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","blueclementinex","26 March 2017","so, i just watched power rangers movie, and i say that all my expectations are fulfilled. to start it off, as a kid i love power rangers, and i almost watched every episodes of it. as a teenager, however i love to make fun of how campy and ridiculous it is, and when i first heard of this movie, my expectations are pretty much low. i mean, come on, just based on the source material which is a very dull (yet funny in a way) it's not like i'm walking to the movie expecting a cinematic masterpiece. first of all, i'm just going to say that, yes, the CGI is no better than what you've seen in the trailer. it's that stupid, but as in what the movie is targeted (which are for the younger audiences ) it's pretty forgivable. although i'm not that sure because sometimes the scenes are way too creepy for the younger audiences, and some of the jokes are pretty mature as well. but it's not the main issue though, because i think it's trying to show that the movie is trying to entertain everybody (which often fails, though).but one of my main issue with this movie is the performances. i'm serious, it's so bad that it becomes an entertainment. there's this particular scene that supposed to be sad and emotional yet somehow left me laughing because the actors literally show no expression to show so but only teary eyes. some of the actors's line delivery are so forced that it came out very funny. Elizabeth banks is so bad that it's embarrassing to watch her. and this bad acting doesn't stop there, it is completed with bad script. i mean, sure i guess you want to make a script that is easy to understand, but it doesn't mean that it has to be that dumb. i mean, seriously, the combination of these two disastrous elements somehow remind of SUICIDE SQUAD. at first, i'm not that sure then there's this scene where they talked about their feelings and their stories but it's so forced, unrealistic, bland, and bad-performed, that suddenly remind me of that bar scene in suicide squad- where every character tries to talk their insecurities and stories to developed the characters but failed, and it happened in this movie, but worse because the actors are way worse than suicide squad. but, rather than trashing this movie, i would like to say a few good things about it, like the score and soundtrack . i mean i'm not saying it's a good score (trust me, in the battle scene where the climax of the movie happened, the music plays the power rangers theme song for a second, cut to a new shot, a second or so after the new shot they played a tense music all of the sudden (which not just bad-placed but very hilarious) , but i really appreciate that the score and soundtrack's shows some similarities with what the show's score and soundtrack. because at some scene, it felt pretty nostalgic to the show. the fight scene is also very ridiculous, but it's ridiculous in a way that we can appreciate it, especially the fans of the shows because believe me, if you watch this movie and thought the fight scenes are dumb, you clearly haven't watch the show's fight scenes. overall, i really recommend you to watch this movie if you're just looking for a popcorn fun, blockbuster movie but don't expect anything bigger than what it's already appears to be.6/10","8/10"

Now the Power Rangers are here in 2017.It's not silly and campy like the original series, this film plays itself very seriously, I mean there is humor but not like the original series. The characters play there parts well and put there own spin on it. Plays like The Breakfast Club with superpowers,puts a little realism in there performances. Elizabeth banks is great has Rita Repulsa, puts a terrifying spin on it. Bryan Cranston is also good has Zordon, playing a old mentor helping the hero's destiny. Effects are good, and action scenes are incredible also.","6/10"

"Power Rangers","ayoreinf","27 March 2017","Being all grown up when the original hit the TV screens, it soon became one of my silliest guilty pleasures. I did like Amy Jo Johnson, who probably launched her career with the series, but she was the single redeeming element in a real stupid series. No real characters, so obviously no real character growth, stupid methodical breaks for morphing time at every stage of morphing they went through, and the lame lame jokes with Bulk and Skull. Still I had to see what they made with the original, so I went to see it on the big screen.This is so much better in comparison with the original I should have rated it off the chart. But even as stand alone movie, it's not a bad one. To begin with we get real characters here, and they do go through some real character growth. It does include some cheesy moments, but as rule the actors are all doing their job well, some even better than well. That is R.J. Cyler and Becky G and Naomi Scott. So the Bulk and Skull jokes are gone, replaced by some real live bullying. The detention room does feel a bit like a recycling of The Breakfast Club, but it's a real minor issue. Rita Repulsa is a real villain here. - Elizabeth Banks is really super in this role, I wish they gave her more screen time.So this is my bottom line. It's definitely a decent fantasy comics action movie, just please don't call it sci-fi, simply have fun watching it.","1/10"
"Power Rangers","Giacomo_De_Bello","7 April 2017","When five teenagers get lost and find themselves in the midst of a gold mine they discover something special: five colored coins in the middle of the rocks. When they start experiencing out of the ordinary events they come back together and figure out that there might be something special to what has happened to them.Dean Israelite clearly demonstrates a passion for this project and I must admit that how the whole thing came together with Lionsgate behind made me actually curious to check out this update, I was somewhat intrigued by the voice and style they were putting behind the film and I, in a way, was right to do so: the first 50 minutes of the film gave me something special, it is sad that they had to be lessened by another hour of complete tonal shift.When I say I was into this film for the fist half or so I mean it literally. This film really surprised and got to me up until then, Israelite was doing some really solid directing, the action scenes were visceral and done in one shot, almost all of the fluff was absent and it left space for some solid and effective character development. I remember having a moment in the theater where I thought that this was actually very solid writing: there were different thrusts being developed efficiently and the screenplay was carrying out smart character touches.The editing was sporadically jarring, but the use of the camera was definitely making up for it: the first five shots of this film have two long takes of action that were genuinely stunning and absorbing. The characters come together in an organic way, defying genre clichés and making for a group of quirky individuals that have an identity and a place with one another, they are all outlined with personal characteristics and become instantly recognizable.Unfortunately after the very inspiring first half there is not much to add here. It seems like they just forgot what movie they were making in the second half. The characters loose grit by being put on a journey that isn't interesting and does not develop them. Tonally the film enters a big shift and starts going for fluff out of nowhere. Israelite seems to forget how to direct interesting action and the whole last act is a disaster of fast paced cutting, not understanding what is going on and overall total loss of affection for anyone involved.It is sad that a film that started out with such a bang in action and character becomes a totally different one by the end and leaves me with so little to add. There is no silver lining, it's just a very disappointing first half that completely undoes what the first one did, it changes in every aspect from the characters and the the tone to the how the action is shot and the CGI is used making ""Power Rangers"" all in all an average effort with a very promising start.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","drawlife","24 March 2017","When I heard this movie was being made, I was optimistic and cautious. While following the hype train, I was happy to see that the film was being taken seriously. The only aspect I really disliked from all the announcements that were being made were the Power Ranger outfits themselves. Aside from that, everything else was pretty much on point. Power Rangers isn't the disaster I was hoping it wasn't going to be. For the original fans out there, this movie just was not going to work with that campy tone similar to the television series. It worked for what it was as a television show for children such as myself back in the day. That just wasn't going to translate well on the big screen, lets not kid ourselves. Plus the previous Power Ranger films that came out in the 90's weren't met with acclaim or did big numbers at the box office. The film's main problem is that it has an identity crisis, trying to be serious teen drama to an adventure filled sci-fi action film. Moments work here and there, sporadically. RJ Cyler is the bright spot as Billy the Blue Ranger. He's the only one that really gives the group of teens a lot flare, and his autistic side is portrayed with respect. Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, Ludi Lin, and Becky G are all given something to do. Montgomery's Jason is the once promising athlete turned screw-up and the team's leader. He almost finds redemption in the film given his responsibilities as the Red Ranger. Scott's Kimberly finds a new home when she's kicked out of her own click in school. Lin's Zack is an outcast who acts tough, but that's just to hide his fears and insecurities. Becky G's Trini is also an outcast loner who comes to accept herself, her coming out is handled with care and treated with respect like Billy's autism. The cast actually is not too bad either and for the most part deliver with their performances. The film tries to give them all layers and it can be engaging, even if it is a Breakfast Club ripoff.Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader are great. Even as a child, I've hated Alpha-5 since the original show premiered and here he's a little less annoying thanks to Hader's performance. Cranston's Zordon has more to do that tell the Rangers who their up against. He's got personality and also has ulterior motives. The weak link is Elizabeth Banks as Rita. She looks like she's having fun and cutting it loose to portray her, but she doesn't do much outside of conquering the world like all typical villains do. We don't really learn anything about her and why she's doing what she's doing. More screen time to develop her would have been nice. At best the film plays out like an episode of any DC/Marvel superhero show on the CW or abc. The origin story is exactly what anyone would expect in an origin story. It can be tiring to sit through as the familiar tropes are extremely apparent and can get boring from time to time. Once it goes into high gear it gets fun. This is where the identity crisis also comes in play as it becomes a CGI, over the top action feast for 15-20 minutes. Despite it being fun to watch, it really never felt completely earned, the story never really positioned itself to actually feel earned. Also bare in mind there is a lot of Krispy Kreme promotion in the film. I've never seen a movie put that much promotion and devotion at all to any product. Being a former Power Ranger die-hard, I cannot watch a single frame of any Power Ranger episodes at all, they're all so terrible, but the nostalgia always stays. For a reimagining/homage it's a step towards the right direction. But it's also a jumbled mess. Should there be a sequel, I would hope it figures out what it wants to be. Also redesign the damn outfits they're an eyesore. Less is more. All in all I'm happy that the filmmakers took the property seriously and I'm open to see what's next. 6.8/10","4/10"
"Power Rangers","walkingwithprimeval","1 July 2021","When I first heard that a new Power Rangers film adaptation was going to get made with a more lavished and sophisticated Hollywood makeover, I thought to myself; ""Seriously? You've got to be kidding me."" When I eventually saw the first teaser trailer, I wasn't the least bit excited for its release. I kept thinking to myself; ""You know? This doesn't look like Power Rangers, at all. Looks way more like Josh Trank's Chronicle than anything else."" When the movie first came out and I got around to seeing it with some pretty low-expectations, it still managed to be a major let down and I was disappointed (but it's been several years since then and I've gotten over it). Now that some time has passed after all these years, I've decided to go back and try to rewatch it over again in an attempt to better evaluate my thoughts since I'm able to properly articulate my real honest feelings on the movie as a whole and see whether or not my opinions on it have changed at all (so it's all fresh in my mind, once more). The film as a whole is filled with so many contrivances that none of its story beats flow together naturally and the humour doesn't always land for me, either (except for Bill Hager's Alpha 5, who did give me a good chuckle from time to time).At times, I felt like I was watching a coming-of-age teen movie and not Power Rangers, and I admired those aspects of the film. But it has such an incredibly jarring tonal shift halfway through, acting like a little small-scale quirky indie drama about a dysfunctional group of social outcasts one minute, and then going all-out into full-on tentpole summer blockbuster mode with the cheesy sci-if concept of intergalactic super-beings who battle against evil forces by controlling big robot dinosaurs (you see the clashing of tones, here?). It's almost like the filmmakers didn't really know how to handle, or even approach, this sort of crazy-but-cool material and so they decided to try this awkward mishmash of different genre elements that don't quite fit. Moments of the journey these loner high-school youths go on can be mildly compelling, like with the campfire scene that happens at the midway point. Each one of them is shown discussing their own personal turmoil that they have to overcome and watching the emotionally-vulnerable ""teenagers with attitude"" open up to one another about the everyday adolescent problems of growing into maturity is admittedly kind of charming, as is seeing them all unite together in the third act (and their whole team-dynamic was also fairly well-developed).Nowadays, I often find myself bored senseless by most modern large-scale movies I see as they're too reliant on CGI-heavy sequences (example; fully CGI characters fighting in a completely CGI environment, which was all the elaborate creation of a VFX team rendering their CGI work on hundreds of computer screens). After a while, it just leaves my brain feeling numb from all the big action set-pieces and lengthy scenes of mindless destruction, which SHOULD be epic and NOT dull (I'm tired of always staring at a longwinded video game cutscene). Marvel Studios are the only ones who've managed to keep the utilisation of photorealistic-CGI visual-effects feeling fresh due mainly in part to them hiring the same VFX companies over and over again, so they're pretty much pros at this point in time and know what they're doing when it comes to seamlessly compositing every digitally-created background shot together in the same scene (not to mention, they have way more money put into their mega-budgets along with the extra time and resources to properly render everything out).And by the way, whatever happened to the colour-palette's bright vibrancy that the Power Rangers franchise has always been predominantly known for? (not to mention, where've all the exciting flashy sparks gone?). After Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, suddenly everyone wanted to get in on the whole ""making superhero films all dark and serious"" craze (and that includes having muted colours). Reimagining the fun-loving upbeat tone of the original colourful source material isn't clever writing, it's just copying what everybody else is doing and reinventing the playful tongue-in-cheek brand for edgy teens and cynical adults to enjoy (much like with the travesty of Michael Bay's Transformers). There's nothing inherently wrong with this practice of business model per say, but there's a limit to how far you're able to ground something like this in total realism (I mean, seriously now). I'll say this in the film's defence, at least it's darkened aesthetic isn't as ugly for my eyes to look at as let's say the murky cinematography of Zack Snyder's movies are (I've just never enjoyed the man's ""artistic vision"").Getting into Power Rangers fan-mode for just a bit; I have very mixed feelings on the Rangers' Zords. On one hand, I like the fact that these powerful alien fighting machines actually appear to be of a somewhat techno-organic nature. But on the other hand, some of the robots are designed in such a bizarre way that it makes them look kind of silly. I mean, the T-Rex, Pterodactyl and Sabretooth all look fine to me (as far as ""Bayformer"" Dinobots go). But what's up with the Triceratops and Mastodon having additional pairs of legs, huh? (I got to say, it's a downright weird stylistic choice to do that). The idea of these colossal assault vehicles taking on the giant molten Goldar monster in their individual metallic beast forms first is neat, but I wasn't too thrilled with the way in which they executed that whole half of the end battle. And the entire Megazord transformation sequence for the final climactic one-on-one brawl could've been shown in much greater detail than it was, being mostly obscured by fiery digital-effects.Rita Repulsa's actress was practically chewing the scenery and hamming it all the way up with her villainess performance, tipping over the acting scale and pushing the dial far past 10 (Elizabeth Banks appears to be the only cast member who's actually having a blast in their role). Bryan Cranston returning to the franchise in a more prominent capacity as wise mentor Zordon was respectable fan-service and an honourable tribute, it seems. And the famous original ""Go Go"" theme song was also a nice inclusion, too (that was a real treat to hear). But with all that Power Rangers nostalgia put aside, is it a good movie on its own for non-fans to watch? Well, now... I'm going to say no, not really (it isn't). The general moviegoing public may find it to be a stale cliched superhero film, about the ancient search for a mystical artefact that's existed since before time began, and will most likely want to opt out in favour of waiting for the next Marvel or DC movie to come along. And the actual diehard purists won't like many of the changes it makes to the long-running series' lore and mythos. And so after numerous compromises by the clueless filmmakers (and possibly the meddling studios, as well), there might not be that much of an incentive left for people to actually WANT to watch this and before you know it, you end up with an unsatisfactory subpar movie that's made to please no one (a lose-lose situation for all parties involved).","10/10"

"Power Rangers","andrebonavita","21 November 2017","I saw this movie without expectation, only waiting a film better than the one made in 1995. The first half-part of the movie is really good, mainly with the rereading of the classical Saban's characters. The 360° rotation camera used in one scene was great. This first part remember me the 2012's movie ""Chronicle"" where young discover their powers. The soundtrack works nicely to introduce the characters and along the movie. Contrasting with the 1/3 part, from 2/3 to the end the director Bryan Spicer gave to us only a median movie with clichés used in TV series an 1995 movie but with extra visual effects. So the great begging was lost and a this median released movie.I like Bryan Cranston as Zordon but as I said before, the director loose his hand at 2/3 part to the end so Cranston could be substituted by anyone with no difference.I think the producers loose a chance to create a bigger cinema franchise and the Pacific Rim.Pros: some fan service and nice soundtrack Cons: median screenplay and chance to produce a better movie.","2/10"
"Power Rangers","thornethomas707","26 March 2017","I can't even explain how excited I was for this movie. When I was a kid I was obsessed with 90s kid shows like Dexters Laboratory, Boy Meets World and my all time favourite Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! So you can understand my disappointment when I finally went to the movie I've been dying to see since I saw the trailer like 3 months ago and it was absolute garbage! This movie was beyond corny and with an extremely unorganized plot. I found all of the Power Ranger actors/actresses to be horrible at acting and shouldn't quit there Day jobs. I found the whole movie just really bad and that was extremely disappointing to me. I really was hoping to be blown away and that definitely did not happen... The only reason I even gave this movie a 4 was just because the cinematography was good and the only thing I liked. All in all I couldn't help roll my eyes and wait for it to end. Definitely regret spending that money on a movie I ended up really not liking!!! :/","9/10"
"Power Rangers","crafterj","25 March 2017","For a guy born in the late 90's I caught the tail end of the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, I've seen it all by now and I have to say this movie does a great job representing the original feeling it gave me as a kid. It also had really deep character moments and so much amazing character growth. The representation of both the autistic spectrum and the LGBTQ spectrum was beautiful and suited the rangers great. The Rangers have always been diverse and now it's in more than just race. The costumes were amazing and the zords were even cooler. If I had to gripe about anything it's the way the rangers were inside the megazord but I can live with that no problem. Seeing what they did with Rita was pure gold and the two cameos in this film was fan service at its best. They felt like power rangers and the way the movie made it fit in with the times was perfect. I want to go back for more of this movie, can't wait for the sequel!","4/10"
"Power Rangers","micamecham","12 August 2017","I thought it was pretty good. Let's be real, Power Rangers was impossibly cheesy and hard to watch in its original form. So you can't expect this to be Oscar worthy. I liked the background. Loved the Billy character and inclusion of someone on the spectrum. I thought Elizabeth Banks, who I LOVE, wasn't as awesome in this as she was in say her Effie Trinket performance, but she was no more cheesy than the original character in this role from the original movies. I do think it took a little long to get to the actual morphing suit wearing part. Additionally, I think for a kid movie, it could have done without the cursing. You have to know kids are going to watch it. Other than that, it was entertaining enough to watch with family on a Saturday night. My kids liked it. Overall, it was entertaining in a ""hey let's watch a movie that is light in thought and entertaining in a predictable but still pretty good for a laid back night"" kind of way.","10/10"

"Power Rangers","Troy_Campbell","24 March 2017","After sitting through this overlong cinematic adventure for the titular band of colourful warriors, it's not completely clear if this was made for the 30-somethings who grew up with the cheesy show or the current generation of pre-teens. Similar in tone and presentation to Michael Bay's Transformers franchise, this big screen adaptation has a healthy dose of teenage angst (and awkwardness), whirling camera-work and rapid-fire editing, suggesting the new crop of kids are the target audience. On the other hand there's a tongue-in-cheek campiness that is clearly meant to tug on the nostalgia strings; the goofily choreographed fights, the insanely hammy villain and the on-the-nose metaphors are all handed over from show to movie. It's hard to see how either demographic is going to walk away wholly satisfied though. A bloated runtime and a lack of action will surely lead to boredom for the young'uns, and the ludicrously long wait to actually see the Power Rangers in full getup could annoy the fans from way back. Waiting until approximately 90 minutes in before the new batch of heroes even suit up, the climax is a CGI flurry of underwhelming baddies, nonsensical action beats and plot contrivances so outlandish they make Vin Diesel films seem as clever as Inception. There's no doubting the noble intentions of this modern update, and Elizabeth Banks is a blast as Rita Repulsa, however this incarnation of Power Rangers fails to quicken the pulse.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","casscamolas","27 March 2017","As good as you thought it would be! I think the most impressive part of this film is how in parts in it is very dark while keeping the same nostalgic feel of the original, Elisabeth Banks reimagine's Rita repulsa to be a violent and cold blooded villain while the rangers themselves throw themselves at being heroes while dealing with everyday problems that teenagers have growing up. Go and watch this film, easily one of the best of 2017 and one that is certainly more for adults who were kids 20 years ago when the ranger arrived!","2/10"

I loved this movie! I actually bought it today and am re-watching it as I type this. It is what I loved yet something new, it still makes me want to be the pink ranger and it's something me and my husband both love and can enjoy together as adults in a different yet similar way as we enjoyed in our youth!

"Power Rangers","Verdugo85","16 June 2017","Anyone that was born in 1984, 1985 and 1986 that grew up watching ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" TV series on FOX 5 after school in the 90s should definitely avoid this crap. My siblings and I grew up with Power Rangers, we were so hooked up on them to the point that our parents found it to be a serious issue but Power Rangers was a great childhood experience.This reboot movie is long, boring and not nostalgic. OK, I get that they were doing a ""re-imagine"" version of the kids show but it was poorly executed and the movie is dark and serious?? Gtfo with that sht! The characters: Jason is a reckless loser, Kimberly is a secret btch, Zack is...I don't even know, I'll give Billy a pass since he's autistic, Trini is a troubled, angry, lesbian/bisexual punk, *sigh* whatever and Zordon is a DICK! These characters are uninspiring. The actors had no chemistry, they were bland, boring and ungathered. The movie spent most of the time introducing the characters who/what they are and then in the last 30 minutes of the film for their first battle as the Power Rangers everything is rushed.""Oh but this is an origin film"" I Don't CARE!! Guardians of the Galaxy was also an origin film for the team and they were written properly.Power Rangers suit looked cool but the Zords? The only zords I noticed was Jason's and Kim's but what are Zack, Billy and Trini zords suppose to be? And the zords assembled out of nowhere with the Megazord looking like Optimus Prime and the CGI sucked.The putties looked like ""The Thing"" from that crappy reboot Fantastic Four 2015 film, Goldar looked like a walking golden liquid T-1000. Rita Repulsa was fine, she was an evil btch but she doesn't save this film..P.S. Cameos of Jason David Frank (Tommy Oliver) and Amy Jo Johnson (Kimberly Hart) brought back great childhood memories that it made me forget this movie.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","MarioSync","3 April 2017","I watched Power Ranger when I was young, and it feels like it was yesterday I saw those dino zord become the Megazord. When I bought the ticket for this movie at first I was quite skeptical since I am wandering how is the writer going to evolve the story about a bunch of teenager getting together and become something else, something bigger than themselves, but I am really happy and glad that my skepticism is not founded. I really like that the movie brings humanity part as well, friendship, trust, the fear of finding something out of this world, and the pace of the story also enough in this time frame. The actors and actress are also good, good casting guys!!! haven't seen Naomi Scott since Terra Nova, and everyone manage to gel the character together well, great job in playing each of your character as well. Hopefully there is a sequel for this, look forward to it.","8/10"

Were watching this movie for about a straight hour just to see the power rangers show up.

"Power Rangers","EthanBJones_03","21 May 2017","Power Rangers(2017) was directed by Dean Israelite and stars Dacre Montgommery, Elizabteth Banks, Krispy Kreme Donuts and RJ Cyler. Five ordinary teens must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove - and the world - is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so, they will have to overcome their real-life issues and before it's too late, band together as the Power Rangers.I won't claim to be a Krisp... Power Rangers expert but what I will say is that this movie blows. I mean the acting was competent and it was well shot but I mean it's got no substance and too little Krispy Kreme Donuts. If you are a long time fan of Power Rangers, you may very well like this movie. I have watched Power Rangers but I know enough about it to make an educated review but I just cannot say this movie is even remotely good. The story is bad. 'Nuff said.All of the actual 'Power Rangers' did good performances(much to my surprise) and thoroughly impressed. Despite this we all know that Krispy Kreme Donuts were the best actors in this movie. I mean they are chameleons. They didn't even need to be on screen for that long and they stole the show. They blended into the background like a dog blends into the road(If this offends you then I'm sorry but I actually don't care). Elizabeth Banks was awfully cheesy as Rita Repulsa and really didn't fit with the tone of the movie. Rita Repulsa was an extremely weak villain and was just plain boring.Technically, this movie is fine. It's a well shot movie and the way they blend Krispy Kreme Donuts into the background was pure artistic genius. The effects were really unbelievably but ultimately looked pretty cool and the costume design was also pretty decent.This movie's main two areas of focus are the action and comedy. It provides good action which is childish fun for the eyes but lacks any good comedy or real jokes. If you proof of that then keep in mind the first joke of the movie is about 'violating' a cow to be 'polite'. In conclusion, I imagine true fans of Power Rangers will enjoy this movie but aside from that I don't see this movie getting much critical praise and I don't really recommend it.4/10","4/10"

"Power Rangers","banditgeneral4","9 July 2018","I've read several reviews and see people complain about how this film is nothing like the original Power Rangers. That's a good tjing.Every version of the Power Rangers is different than the last. That's what makes it unuque. I'm a child of the mud 80s and early 90s. I was 9 when the original show aired. I couldn't wait to get home from school and see the adventures of the Rangers. I would rent episodes on video every week with my allowance. The action could've been better and the plot a little more thought out but overall it's a film worth seeing. It's far different from any of the other shows or movies and that's what's great about it. It also broke all the rules. The smart kid is now African American and not the ""black"" ranger and the black ranger is now Asian American.If folks don't like the movie they are certainly entitled to their opinions but as for this reviewer I would definitely watch it again and it's going in my video collection.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","MisterFantastical","22 March 2017","I was a fan of the show in the nineties; I found it extremely entertaining because of its simplicity and goofiness. I enjoyed the 1995 film for the same reasons, and the likability of the cast. So, I wanted this movie to, at least, be entertaining. It was not. The characters were bland, uninteresting, and unlikable. The costumes, so to speak, looking terrible, and exactly what you'd expect from people attempting to update a campy 90's show. There wasn't a single character to whom people could relate in the whole movie. If anything, the experience was exhausting and infuriating. Picture the Transformers movie with WORSE effects and even less likable characters. Do yourself a favor; do no go see this bland, useless nonsense.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","pokedom","29 July 2017","Let me start off by saying: I have never, ever, been a Power Rangers fan. Never. Not even as a little kid. It just seemed dumb. So here's this movie trying to cash in on the still popular series. It was never going to be fantastic, but by God it could try. And... I burst out laughing at least 5 times. On complete accident, I should note.I should probably skip talking about every problem before the last act and go directly into talking about the ""final battle"". I use quotes because it's not a battle, it's a product placement. The most shameless and saddening product placement I've ever seen. And I thought Guardians of the Galaxy 2's Dairy Queen product placement bugged me! Anyways, the first 2/3rds of the movie are just training and character development. Which would be fine if it was handled well, but its not. The ""mentor"" character (wall) tells them the world is going to end in 14 days. 14 days and a 5 minute training montage with terrible music later and they haven't learned a thing. So I'll just skip it.The ""final battle"" starts with the blue ranger dying... only to come back to life 5 minutes later. Pretty pointless, but he did tell the main bad girl where the all powerful crystal of life giving energy was, so he had it coming.So at this point no one is asking where this crystal is. I can tell you... you are not ready. It's not at the heart of the town (STORYBROOKE OHMAHGAHD), it's not under the house of a ranger.It is... underneath a goddamn Krispy Kreme.I gave up on the film after this. I was willing to look past the awkward dialogue and acting before and accept this as a nostalgia pander to a crowd I was not in. But this right here got me bursting with laughter. And the final battle is just the power rangers in dino- bots defending a Krispy Kreme. They say it multiple times too, ""We have to protect the Krispy Kreme!"" The main bad girl looks at a cup with the Kreme logo and says ""The crystal..."" and I just burst out laughing again. Really? REALLY? The all powerful crystal of life, the thing that allows the humans of Earth to exist, is underneath a donut shop in Storybrooke. It's so incredibly dumb.The next scene is just the main bad girl eating a donut. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP! There is a movie based on a nostalgic property that a lot of people love, and their using this lure to show off Krispy Kreme! The movie was iffy before, but this? This feels wrong! No one should willingly sit through this! I did because I figured it would just be generic boring stuff, not a commercial for a donut shop!The movie just kinda ends, after Satan rises from Hell and grabs a bite from Krispy Kreme... sorry, I meant the Megazord rises from the crystal and grabs the main bad girl and blasts her off into space. Then the innocent bystanders, who have just kinda been background noise until now, only NOW whip out their phones and take pictures. Wait, they weren't before? When the main bad girl was destroying the town you weren't livestreaming it to 15 people on Instagram? What kind of town is this?Ultimately this movie was pretty bad. If you're looking for Power Rangers, watch the show instead. It's not worth all the stupid stuff in this movie for you to sit through just to get maybe 20 minutes of the Rangers. I will say this: after this film I said ""Down with the establishment!"" and got Dunkin Donuts instead.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","stglplp","27 March 2017","The graphic is absolutely astounding.

Definitely bring the chill to all those 90s kids when they appear first in their morphing form and especially spectacular super hero landing right there!","4/10"
"Power Rangers","seige-hound","28 March 2017","I liked watching Power Rangers. It was a good time, but I feel that the actual 'Power Rangers' part of Power Rangers was a missed opportunity. Let me explain.So, the film is about five teenagers (17-18 years-ish) who all have their personality quirks. Jason is a jock who gets busted for stealing a cow(?) and is under house arrest. Billy is an autistic guy with a knack for explosives. Kimberley is a mean girl cheerleader who was disowned by her friend group. Zach is a guy who skips school and is overly outgoing to compensate for the dread of possibly losing his sick mother. And Trini is a weirdo outcast who is implied to be a closeted lesbian.So we got this ragtag group of kids, all pretty likable with room to develop further, and they discover an alien spacecraft buried under hundreds of metres of rock, and five coloured 'coins' that give them superpowers.And for the first hour and a half or so, we get a pretty neat 'Chronicle meets Breakfast Club' high school drama going on. We get Bryan Cranston as Zordon, the spirit of a past Power Ranger, some robot thingy, and the villain Rita Repulsa, an ex-ranger who is hellbent on destroying the world, as per usual.Rita is pretty good, if a bit cheesy. She isn't quite as over the top as the original Rita from the show (at least from what I've seen) but she's in a similar vein, albeit a bit darker in tone. She's still crazy in a cheesy sort of way, but she is much more violent, and she is shown killing innocent people to get their gold tooth fillings (she's collecting gold to build a giant creature called Goldar, who is made of gold. Just go with it) I think that even through the cheese, she came across as a formidable foe for the teenagers.My main issue with this film, and the reason I rated it a 6/10 instead of higher, is that the climax is severely underwhelming. When the rangers finally morph into their suits, they look cool, but the action itself is boring. There are three major fight sequences in a 2 hour action film. One without their costumes, one in, and one with them riding the Zords, the latter one being the largest. I'm familiar enough with the show to know that this is pretty much how an episode is formatted, but the balance of action is a bit off for the average movie-going person.Now the character development is pretty solid, and I'll give them credit for actually developing the characters instead of assuming the viewer knows enough about the show to fill in the gaps. But I think they should have tried to strike a better balance between character and action. I'm not sure how they would be able to do that for this film, but my feelings remain the same.It is a good film, don't get me wrong. It's not an amazing film, but it's good, and I hope that they consider making a sequel with more, better action.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","FeastMode","24 July 2019","Ummmmm guilty pleasure? Yes. Very fun and awesome, super nostalgia. Lots of cool action, although some was sloppy. This is a fun mindless movie. Lots of flaws and things you can make fun of but they didn't bother me because I was expecting it. And also because like the Ninja Turtles, some things can't really be done seriously in a live action movie. But I really enjoyed it. Good music too. (3 viewings, 8/13/2023)SPOILERSother than the little things you can make fun of, my biggest flaws with the movie are that Rita was kind of a joke, and that they only fought in their armor for like 60 seconds. I woulda liked to see more of that. And more of a focus on martial arts rather than superhero punches.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","Hellmant","5 April 2017","POWER RANGERS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the superhero film series, based on the popular kids' TV show (from the 1990s). This one is a reboot that features new cast members, playing the main characters of the original TV series, with a modern origin story. It was directed by Dean Israelite (who also helmed the 2015 teen sci-fi flick 'PROJECT ALMANAC'), and it was produced by the series creator Haim Saban. John Gatins, Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney served as writers on the film; which also features a mostly inexperienced young new cast (including Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Becky G and Ludy Lin). The supporting cast also features Elizabeth Banks (as the evil villain), the voice of Bill Hader, and Bryan Cranston (who also voiced characters on the original TV show). The film has been a hit at the Box Office, but it's also only received mixed reviews from critics. I think it's a big improvement over the source material, but it's still nothing too special.The story begins on prehistoric Earth, when the Power Rangers (Earth's protectors) are betrayed by the Green Ranger, also known as Rita Repulsa (Banks). The Red Ranger, named Zordon (Cranston), hides the Rangers' powers coins (which are their power source). He then has his robot assistant, named Alpha 5 (Hader), cause a meteor strike; which wipes out Zordon, Rita and all of the dinosaurs (although Rita survives the blast, and so does Zordon's consciousness). In modern day, five misfit teenagers discover the power coins. They're then tasked with defending the planet, from Rita, by becoming a new team of Power Rangers, under the guidance of Zordon's consciousness.The movie is the most interesting when it's developing it's five teenage lead characters; and it definitely gets a lot of points for being the first major superhero film to feature LGBTQ and autistic superheroes. The story, and cheesy action scenes, are definitely a lot less interesting, and inspiring, than the teenage drama though. Those scenes are still pretty cheesy as well; although they're a lot better done than they were in the ultra-corny kids' TV show. I'd say it's a good movie for kids, at the very least, and it shouldn't bore adults too much either.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/208412653","5/10"
"Power Rangers","Dark_Lord_Mark","14 June 2017","I really wanted to like this movie. This was PR, and based on the original classic TV show that has millions of fans and a cult like following.PLOT: Five Teens with too much attitude and zero likability and no real reason to be liked become heroes. This is what this movie was. It was jumbled mess and poorly written and acted. When you saw Elizabeth Banks cast as Rita, you knew it was already a shiitshow! ACTING/SCRIPT: The unknown actors couldn't really act and neither can Banks. Well at least as Rita. Besides the terrible script, the line delivery was a mess. The Teens had problems, but nothing that made you feel sorry for them. Each teen seemed to be awful people, and at no point does the writers attempt or at least succeed in making you like them. Everyone is a rule breaker, a bad boy or a bad girl.WRITING/CASTING: It felt the director and studio simply wanted diversity of cast rather than actors who can act. No one really fit their role outside and that includes miss banks. The studio seemed more interested in diversity and political correctness than the script.CGI/ACTION: The biggest flaw was the CGI. It's the easy way out and always seems to be the downfall of modern movies. The fight sequences were poorly done and hard to follow but. This was a bad movie without the heart of the original TV show and a jumbled mess. The music score also deserves a nod for how terrible it was.This Version of PR is a Bay-esque, poorly written, shot, acted and CGI-ed mess. Fans deserved better.","2/10"
"Power Rangers","851222","17 June 2017","Greetings from Lithuania.In order for a movie ""Power Rangers"" (2017) to work and kinda deliver i think you need three main ingredients (or at least they worked for me):1. A boring evening with some good friends. 2. A ""leave your brain at the door"" mood. 3. Some light alcohol involved.I kinda found this movie to be not bad flick at all. It had some surprisingly very nice writing (for the material), some nice acting and humor which creates this ""don't get this to serious"" type of a mood. Although you still need to leave your brain at the door when watching this movie, i found it kinda involving. Sure this movie had to bring to a great Bryan Cranston the most easiest paycheck in his life but he does deliver simply by his voice - now this is a true talent. And while the whole plot of a second part of a movie could be summed up in a ""kinds movie - VERY young kinds movie"" line - it kinda worked for me - but those three above mentioned ingredients were involved.

"Power Rangers","ThomasDrufke","27 March 2017","Power Rangers is pretty much exactly what I pictured it being. Big budgeted movie, cheesy enough to please the fans of the old TV series', but mature enough for most ages to enjoy. There's nothing new or exciting here, but the execution was about as updated as you can make a film about 5 outcasts coming together to save the world as armored rangers.Surprisingly, the one thing I think they did a good job of balancing was the tone. I'm in the minority, but the revolving tone of the movie is exactly what I think the movie needed to have, after having a chance to view it. Because of what the Rangers TV shows have been, it's hard to both recapture the tone and reinvent it for new audiences. For me, this movie did a nice job of establishing a new generation of Rangers in a more serious world, without sacrificing the goofy humor that most fans love. Did the humor hit the way the writers hoped? Probably not. The cheesy humor, or lack thereof, is in part because of Transformers-esque writing, but it also could fall on the shoulders of the directing and acting.It's difficult to cast a movie like this. People have a certain vision as to who each Ranger should be and represent. I give credit to Lionsgate for making one of the leads gay, and one autistic, but I didn't find any of the Rangers to be all that interesting. While fine overall, the acting didn't add anything to the typically generic coming of age dialogue. That is, besides a few performances. Elizabeth Banks is great as Rita Repulsa, a mixture of over-the-top popcorn fun and creepiness. I also found there to be a lot to like about Naomi Scott as Kimberly/Pink Ranger. When all the chips are down and each Ranger is breaking down their backstory, she was the only one I found myself emotionally connected to. Perhaps aware of all the hate towards the more serious DC films, and love towards the lighter Marvel films, Power Rangers saves it's most impressive action for the final 30 minutes. In all its CGI madness, there's no denying how nostalgic and fun the ride is. Sure, I'm not invested in the characters as much as I would have liked, but it's sure as heck better than the Transformers and Ninja Turtles films. Serviceable is a nice way to describe this one.+Undeniably fun+Banks & Scott-Script-Nothing new and surprising6.5/10","6/10"
"Power Rangers","sauravjoshi85","24 November 2023","Power Rangers is a superhero film directed by Dean Israelite. The film stars Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Becky G, Ludi Lin, Bill Hader, Bryan Cranston, and Elizabeth Banks.A group of high-school students acquire superpowers after they discover an alien spaceship. They soon learn about its origin and use their abilities to fight against evil extraterrestrials.After reading so many good reviews on the google review about the film i thought either i saw the wrong film or am reading the review of any other film but after coming to IMDb and reading the reviews here i was pretty satisfied infact relaxed that i am not the only one who didn't liked this film and there are many of them. It's not the case that the film is bad but the stereotyped and stale execution with predictable screenplay ruins the film and somewhere you'll feel that oh come on show us something new, we have seen this many times.The plot of the film is average and execution is below par and predictable. The acting is average to decent and screenplay of the film is also purely predictable. The climax of the film also doesn't excites much.If you are a die hard fan of power rangers and can see anything and everything then this is the film for you otherwise please ignore.","5/10"
"Power Rangers","Reno-Rangan","13 October 2017","It was one of those films known that it would fail even before being made. I've rated the rebooted 'Fantastic Four' better than this. I am not a 'Power Rangers' fan, but I was looking forward to it. Expected to be a decent, not this low. The major issue with the film was the story. What the heck! All the superhero films have this same platform. That's really boring. Even that's how the real 'Power Rangers' is, does not matter, it should have been re-wrote completely. Just like they had updated the costumes from cloths to metal armours.As usual, the actors are not to be blamed. Those young guys did good. Direction, not bad too. The graphic, nothing new or that impressive. If we observe closely all the CGI shot, they do not look fine, especially if you know all this stuff like an animator or something. The villain was weak. But the entire film was like just an introduction. They had held up everything till the last quarters to bring all together and make a massive stand off between the good and the bad.Maybe it could work for kids. Those who liked Marvel and DC superhero films would only find it a trash. The best thing about the film is, it is watchable, despite everything are familiar and predictable. I'm not in favour of a sequel, but surely they will make one. And that's result would decide the franchise's future, which I think has a slim chance against those superhero films that already bagged the large sum of fans to its pocket. As I said, the remaining one are children, who are upcoming generation. So if the filmmakers target them, even the adults would sit quiet and watch without whining.4/10","5/10"
"Power Rangers","jeffellis92","18 July 2018","As the source material of this movie is from a campy, silly show written for children, the movie actually came out very good. They did a much better job establishing the characters than a lot of other higher rated super hero movies. The action was really well shot and choreographed as well, in that you could actually see what they were doing and it looked good. My only complaint being that there could have been more of it. I'm usually not crazy about these remakes, but I honestly hope they make another one.","5/10"
"Power Rangers","nightstalker-7","5 August 2017","People who are giving this movie low score is, because they're probably dumb kids from 95+ - 2005+ or something. I'm 1984 and I grew up on power rangers. This movie kind of managed to catch up the atmosphere and all what was in the genuine series, so cheers for that.Author had to do some stuff very fast, so the roles were shallow and...well, just like the genuine power rangers :)","6/10"
"Power Rangers","matthewssilverhammer","29 March 2017","The very concept of ""Power Rangers"" is like straight from a child's playtime: kid-aged superheroes, funny robots, dino-vehicles, creepy aliens, rock ninjas, Kaiju-Transformer battles. This 21st century incarnation fulfills all these juvenile points, with hectic editing, clichéd dialogue, bad music & convenient predictability in nearly every story beat. Yet somehow, this unexpected remake is still silly-fun for middle-schoolers, with just the tiniest amount of narrative and character weight to engage adults, especially the nerdier ones. Like The Breakfast Club with karate, five misfit teenagers in detention stumble upon some ancient alien stones, which turn them into a team of superheroes who must fight an evil alien baddie named Rita (one of the most hilarious villain names ever). Other than Billy, the genius nerd with a Drax-like propensity for being too literal, the characters sort of get lost in the noise and color, written either too specific or too vague. However, the movie experience is largely pretty fun. In the style of movies like Chronicle and Raimi's Spider-Man, we watch these youth deal with their new powers with wide-eyed excitement. The action scenes are cartoonishly intense, the cinematography moves with surprising brains, and the climax is even a mild seat-clincher. Would this have worked better as a serialized TV show? Probably. The stuff in the bones of this universe is good, but its flesh is a bit flabby in this format. Still, as an old fan of this supremely stupid property, this is a nostalgic and sincere little fantasy outing. Go-go Power Rangers, indeed.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","Movie_Muse_Reviews","28 June 2017","First they came for the TV shows of kids who grew up in the '80s. It was only a matter of time before they came for my shows. As for how this big-screen adaptation fairs, color me indifferent.I was 6 years old when Saban's ""Power Rangers"" made its way to Fox Kids programming. The impression that this campy show – made by weaving footage of ""teenagers with attitude"" in Angel Grove with a Japanese ""Super Sentai"" show – left on me was indelible with its colors, imagination and structure. Yet the ""Power Rangers"" and their decades of iterations generated nostalgia for a wide array of Millennials, and the oldest subset (to which I belong) is definitely not the target demographic of the 2017 ""reboot.""""Power Rangers"" takes aim at a 13-22 demographic to be sure with a story that combines ""Transformers"" with ""The Breakfast Club."" A lot of attention is paid to story and rooting these five Rangers in reality. They are outcasts and renegades who have made mistakes. They seem to be attractive and cool on the outside but all experience some kind of pain, something that will surely resonate with teen audiences in a today's era of digital appearances versus reality.But what screenwriter John Gatins (""Real Steel"") and the two writing duos who worked on the story put into character development takes away from the entertainment value. The action of ""Power Rangers"" is delayed, scarce and no more remarkable than anything seen in the ""Transformers"" films, despite director Dean Israelite's solidly kinetic direction. All the attention to giving the story some heart ends up taking away from the entertainment value.In other words, in an effort to avoid the pitfalls of a ""Transformers"" film (all bots and no emotions), ""Power Rangers"" ends up being one of those classic, overdone origin stories. A huge chunk of the movie is dedicated to the Rangers becoming worthy enough to morph into their armor, a step we know they will take. The fact that they earn it doesn't necessarily make the payoff sweeter when any fan of the movies knows it wouldn't be a ""Power Rangers"" movie if the Rangers didn't morph, or get in their Dino-Zords, or become the Megazord.The seriousness with which the film attends to character development also leaves someone like Elizabeth Banks as the evil sorceress, Rita Repulsa, out to dry. She's the only character who maintains the campy tone of the TV series, meaning that as funny as Banks can be, she stands out in a painfully awkward way when she's the only one making corny remarks – the humor among the Rangers is more modern campy (like when R.J. Cyler's Billy says ""Come at me, bro."")Camp doesn't play well in modern blockbusters, but historically it's an essential energy of the ""Power Rangers"" franchise. The movie does not embrace it, but neither can it avoid it – the whole series is about someone who just wants to take over the world and keeps making monsters to attack the same city, a plan that every time is thwarted by a group of teenagers. In approaching the material this way – focusing on character to make the ""Power Rangers"" content more meaningful yet not figuring out a way to make it equally more fun – the film straddles two incompatible tones. The film works toward and understands the value of both tones, but they only inhibit or contradict each other.On the positive side, the art direction brings the previously spandex-and-plastic-clad Power Rangers to life in a visually compelling way and the stars – Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Ludi Lin and Becky G – make the script's character work feel worth it.""Power Rangers"" is certainly not terrible, but struggles to be unique in a highly competitive blockbuster landscape. The elements of the film all feel borrowed from other superhero or teens with powers movies and not quite enough of the show's spirit makes the cut to give ample props for the nostalgia factor. Far from an embarrassment, but far from a success.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more","10/10"
"Power Rangers","kurisutofusan","21 February 2021","I'm not into Sentai series. Power rangers started when I was young and I watched a few without really getting interested.
I postponed watching this movie, assuming it would look cheap and geared toward kids.
However, the special effects tempted me to finally give it a try today and I'm not disappointed I did!
It was really enjoyable and I want a sequel!","5/10"
"Power Rangers","barbagvido","27 April 2017","Power Rangers is a sort of anticipated movie based on the popular kids show all 90s kids grew up with. I wouldn't really call myself a 90s kid since I was born at the end of the 90s, but I did watch some of the show as a kid. And while it wasn't a crucial part of my childhood, I remember watching it occasionally, so I was interesting in how this would turn out. And I'm not sure what I think about it.It tries to balance the light silly tone and the dark, more grounded approach. Does it manage? Nope. It tries to take itself seriously (while some really, really, REALLY cringy jokes are thrown into the mix) and then it goes full ""Screw it, this is based on a kids show!"" mode. And it just doesn't go well together. It's like they couldn't decide what movie they wanted to make. The acting has isn't very good either. Some actors tried, bit still didn't really stand out. But one bad performance stands out and that's Elizabeth Banks. I usually like her as an actress, but she was so over the top here that I sort of loved it. You can see she's having fun in this role and you are having fun watching her. She's definitely the most memorable part of the movie. And she's not the only unintentional laugh here. The whole movie is full of those (or sometimes just cringes). Especially if you're a bit dirty minded, a lot of lines will sound so, so wrong. But what lifts this movie up is that its fun, the actors have a lot of chemistry even though the acting is not much and the whole team and their relationship is very well established and it's probably the strongest point of the movie.Overall, I guess it's passable, it's fun. But I really don't know by what kind of standards and expectations one should watch the movie because of the tone issues.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","TheOneThatYouWanted","4 May 2017","This movie surprised everyone by not su@king. And honestly the acting saves the film. The plot is good enough for what they needed to do. The movie is a reboot of the Power Rangers series from back in the days. Frankly Power Rangers never really left because of its hardcore fans but still, it needed to be rebooted into a new franchise. And so far so good, I approve of this reboot. It isn't great. The action did not feel as epic as it should for a major motion picture, mainly because of the setting. And the villain is the annoying sore thumb of the film. But yeah, like a said before the acting was good and the actors had good chemistry; all except that one girl in yellow. Whatever, it's alriiiight. 7 out of 10.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","crakatoot","23 March 2017","I remember watching the premiere back when I was six years old, and... I thought it was idiotic. The original show was always to goofy for me, even as a little boy. But I had nothing to do and I had some movie passes so I decided to check it out. It's actually pretty good. A lot of critics are going into this expecting to hate it and their reviews reflect that. In the reviews I've read or seen, I keep hearing things like ""Well its not as stupid as it could have been"" or ""Some of it wasn't so terrible"" or other equally back handed compliments. The reality is, the Power Rangers is an inherently silly idea. But once you get past that, this is a pretty fun movie. You know the drill, five kids get together in Angel Grove, a much grittier Angel Grove than I remember. They get their hands on some power coins, Rita Repulsa shows up and some over the top action ensues. So yes, it is just a bigger version of what we saw on the show, but still effective. It takes itself more seriously than the show did and it is much darker. But it doesn't go to far, it still feels close to the original and it does have its lighter moments. Its biggest strength though was the chemistry between the leads. The five kids really worked well with each other. And they did spend time developing each of them. They definitely worked well as a team. And Elizabeth Banks killed it as Rita. I've heard some reviewers complain that she was to over the top, but no way. Rita is supposed to be over the top. You can tell Banks was having a lot of fun. She had a particularly brutal scene with the Trini the Yellow Ranger. And needles to say, the climax was awesome. The new Zords, the new costumes, they looked great. If I had one complaint, and it is a bit odd, the two girls are a little to similar. The three boys are all distinct. But the two girls, they even look way to much alike. Once the costume are on, then it's easy to tell. And if your a big fan of the series, pay attention, there are a few references here and there.","6/10"

"Power Rangers","Mysterygeneration","6 January 2024","Power Rangers is a visually stunning, action-packed movie that pays respect to its original material by fusing nostalgia with a contemporary perspective. The ensemble, comprising a diverse group of actors, infuses their roles with charm and enthusiasm, creating a relatable bond with the audience. The movie does a good job of updating the beloved franchise with modern themes and a more complex treatment of individual backstories. But occasionally, the plot feels predictable, leaning too much on teenage superhero clichés, and the pacing drags. The film's spectacle is enhanced by the CGI effects, although sometimes they take center stage over the character-driven elements, which makes room for a more well-rounded story. Fans of the original series will find Power Rangers appealing, but others may wish for a more inventive and seamless storytelling technique.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","jpachar82","11 July 2017","Debuting on August 28, 1993 as the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the franchise started out as just a little show about some teenagers gaining powers and defeating the evil that was lurking in the shadows of the world. Now enter into 2017, as the Power Rangers come back with a whole new and powerful way of taking on the forces that derail, so to speak, alien forces to take over the world. With the help of the Saban family, Dean Israelite (the director of the new film), took the Power Rangers to a whole new level. As young teenagers, who face life's biggest issues and being isolated from the world, they forge together a new bond, a bond that is stronger than adhesive tape, a powerful bond that links them together for eternity. With a threat, that will help tear them apart, played seductively and beautifully by the one alien woman that would be the breaking point of the Rangers – Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks – The Hunger Games franchise), she will stop at nothing to take over the world. I loved this movie, didn't think I would, but I would love to see where they are going to take the story and the characters.","9/10"
"Power Rangers","samyoung-82648","31 March 2017","I've been waiting a few years for Hollywood to introduce some diversity back into films. Female ninja warrior & CEO & scientist & hacker in 1: done to death. Idiot male cast : done to death. Black infallible hero : done to death. This movie is none of those.We've got a black computer nerd who is also autistic. Awesome! Progress. We've got female bullies. Awesome! Thought Hollywood banned them. We've got a reasonable male lead who is strong and not stupid. Progress!None of the characters is especially strong, they depend on each other. The females aren't arrogant, each of the characters feels sincere (except the female villain who is somewhat silly).If you're looking for a fun flick that avoids the usual sexist politics, go see this movie. It won't win any awards and it will be forgotten in 2 years. However, they shook off the usual stereotype you've seen in the last 50 blockbusters.Well done to everybody who made this movie. It was radical (ie. avoiding sexist stereotypes). I'm glad someone had the courage.Highly recommended.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","Daniels_review","4 March 2021","What do we have here...?
To be honest: Nothing special. This movie can be split in two parts. In the first part you see the Teenagers becoming the Power Rangers, in the second part the fight.The first part is more interesting then you would think for a superhero movie. It shows you the life of every single character and the struggles they have to deal with. All of this is needed so they can finally form up to a team and become the rangers. This part is good if you like stuff like this. Its about teenagers so it come a bit cheesy. (Every single one of them is a misfit and they open up about it.) The big problem is, that even in one and a half hours you can't fit the story of 5 people AND the story of the whole power rangers thing. So even if this is an important part it falls a bit flat. (And you end up with a hard time remembering even all of the five names.The second part is about the fight. And sadly it looses everything for me. Im serious, the fight scenes are just not good. Started interesting when they fight in their suits but goes downhill when they got into their zords.Watching it you could thinks that this is a movie for children/teenagers (I mean.... You know...?) What really bothers me about it, is the first scene where you find a joke about one guy jerk off a cow. So is it for kids? Or not?Conclusion: If this is for children or teenagers the film in it self is ok (just the first scene...) if this is for adults, then it is actually bad. So you can watch it, just don't expect too much from it. The character part is good, the fight part is really bad. So don't go for the fights, go for the story. If you don't want this, then better don't watch it.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","ksuever_009","24 March 2017","Before I begin, I must tell you one of the biggest spoilers of this movie. IT'S NOT LIKE THE TV SHOW FROM THE 90s! If you grew up watching it like I did, this will be a little different than the one our generation grew up with. Trust me when I tell you, that's a good thing. Imagine if Batman movies still had the likeness of Adam West's portrayal of Batman from the 60s! It would be lame and people would get sick of it! That being said, let's dive in!THE TV SHOW VS THE MOVIE This movie still has the core values that make up the lore of the Power Rangers: They still morph. They still have to join forces as a team to stop evil. They still need to call on their Zords when they need more power. Rita is still out to destroy the world and take over. Goldar makes an appearance, but he doesn't speak.The things that separate this movie from the TV show are: They don't have fighting skills starting out; they have to train. They are given super powers like strength and speed that let them punch harder, jump higher and so on. They can't morph at first because they don't have the skill to do so. They need to draw the power out that exist inside of them. Zordon even makes them feel bad about it by saying ""If you can't morph, you aren't rangers."" What a jerk! LOLTHE PLOT The movie opens up with Zordon (Bryan Cranston) fighting Rita, and losing. In his last attempt to stop her, he knocks her into the ocean and she is in a state of hibernation until present day. Zordon, with his last breaths, seals away the power coins, or rocks if you'd prefer, for a future team of rangers to find. Skip ahead to present day and you see Jason, Kimberly, and Billy all in Saturday morning detention. They all made mistakes, and they all are paying for it. They eventually meet the other two members of the team, Zack and Trini at a digging site. Billy's father died and I assume he was a scientist of some sort. Billy has a fascination with rocks and blows into some rocks and the team discovers the power crystals. When he blew the rocks that exposed the crystals, security forces were called in to find out who was playing around with explosives. The team escapes in Billy's mother's minivan. As they approach a train crossing they attempt to make it but don't. Oddly, they all wake up at home but notice they have powers. They all meet up at the site again and find the secret lair to Zordon's fortress. They encounter Alpha-5 (BTW HE DOES SAY ""AYE, YI, YI, YI, YI!"" He says it once, and it's not annoying!) They are introduced to Zordon's essence; which is another way of saying the original Zordon is gone, but he can still come back. Zordon wants the new rangers to help him come back, but to do that, they need to prove they are capable of morphing. Morphing, apparently comes from the inside out. It sounds cheesy, but it looks awesome! The group cannot do it and so, Zordon makes them train without armor. They get the snot beaten out of them! It makes it more realistic from the viewer's standpoint. They didn't ask for this, they didn't want this, they are just kinda rolling with it, and they eventually earn the role. (It reminds me of Spider-man, the Toby McGuire films.) They were gifted powers they don't know how to use because they never had them before. It makes you want to see them toughen up and grow as super heroes! After going through that process, Alpha-5 shows them the Zords ""when you're ready, you will pilot these,"" he tells them. Zack can't wait, and he steals one and drives it, horribly. Later that night, Rita visits Trini at home and threatens to kill her if she doesn't tell Rita where the Zeo Crystals are. Rita mocks Trini because she cannot morph, and then offers her to join Rita against Zordon. She gives her an ultimatum, and requests that she meet her to make her decision. Rita threatens that ""tomorrow I will destroy your city."" Trini meets with the other rangers and tells them about the encounter. They meet Rita and try to fight her without armor and get their butts handed to them. She kills Billy after finding out from him, where the crystals are located. The team take Billy to Zordon and then, because of their efforts, acting as real rangers, Zordon can return. He doesn't. He uses that power to bring Billy back to life. The rangers morph and then head out to stop Rita. They use their skills and armor to beat down Putties, and eventually call on their Zords. They stop Rita by combining their Zords. When they defeat Rita, she tells the rangers that ""others will come, it won't be just me!"" (I hope she means Lord Zed!). Jason asks her to give up her power crystal and staff, and surrender to Zordon. She refuses, and they literally B!@CH SLAP her into space. As she ascends into space, she hibernates again, turning to ice.FINAL THOUGHTS This movie is nothing like the TV show I grew up with in the 90s. I have fond memories of that show from when I was a kid, but it matured. For that I am thankful! It was fun to watch, and it brought the little kid inside of me out. My kids loved it, and I can certainly say it exceeded my expectations! It's not like the show I remembered, but that's okay. It's actually better IMHO. BTW, there were two rangers from the TV show that cameoed towards the end. I won't spoil that for you! 😉","6/10"

"Power Rangers","Screen_Blitz","28 June 2017","Who would have expected for Saban's cheesy, yet popular television franchises to spear their way back on the silver screen? Unless you were a child growing in the 90s or early-to-mid 2000s as the fan of the one of the TV shows, chances are you were expecting the team of teenagers confined into their robotic suits to decimate into obscurity. Against those odds, Dean Israelite, the director behind the mediocre found-footage thriller 'Project Almanac', becomes the operator of the first Power Rangers film to hit the theaters since the abysmal sequel titled 'Power Rangers Turbo' two decades ago. In a shocking conclusion, this teen superhero boasts a surprising amount of competence compared to the overwhelming goofiness that defined the original source material. Tearing away from the television shows' campy style in favor of a slightly gritter approach, Israelite somewhat proves that you can uproot more competence out of a source material that is highly unknown for harvesting a lick of intelligence. That is not to say that his execution kicks off on a clunky start. This film follows a group of high school strangers: mischievous Jason (played by Dacre Montgomery), former cheerleader Kimberly (played by Naomi Scott), smart, but bullied loner Billy (played by (RJ Cyler), a social outcast Trini (played by Becky G), and a lonely Asian Zack (played by Ludi Linn). Upon coming across a mysterious alien ship underground, these teens acquire uncanny superpowers and are enlisted by a computerized-being named Zordon (voiced by Bryan Cranston) and his robotic dwarf Alpha-5 (voiced by Bill Hader) to save the world against an evil queen named Rita Repulsa (played by Elizabeth Banks). By far the easiest and arguably most predictable achievement this film acquires from Dean Israelite's direction is generating immense nostalgia for fans of the television series. The most notable element would be splicing in the theme song at the height of the climatic battle sequence. Israelite's directorial efforts on bringing the popular source material to life however, finds no escape from the flaws that riddle the final product. Rather than introducing the character as veterans of the titular superhero squad, the movie boasts an origin story follows the genesis of the teens acquiring their powers. Spending the first half establishing each of the teen's backgrounds, one of which involves the Asian kid coping the sickness of his mother, another involving a teen girl questioning her sexuality upon meeting these new others. That is right! the superhero genre has just gave birth to their first LGBT superhero. Anyway, the film does show a muscle with character development rather settling generic high school stereotypes. But what about the fun? The main problematic aspect here is the struggle to bring back the campy, if cheesy fun that made the original television franchises entertaining. Whether it is from sore lack of superhero action up until the final twenty minutes or the clunky tonal shifts, the excitement of the titular heroes fight to save the world feels shallow. The climatic battle sequence at the end is somewhat fun and visually appealing, but is nothing impressive. The performances from the cast are mostly solid, though Elizabeth Banks's hammy portrayal as the villain Rita Repulsa feels somewhat out of place. There's a few well landed attempts at humor along dozens of laughable one-liners dealing with Krispy Kreme. What is up? Was the director trying to disguise this movie into a two-hour commercial for a donut shop. Maybe not, but it almost feels like it.Power Rangers is surprisingly proficient adaptation of the source material of the same name with some goods to offer, but perhaps not much so for those unconverted to the Power Ranger fandom. Above all, it is more than likely the nostalgia of the popular television shows will triumph over the writing and direction. Entertained or not, there is a hint of a sequel lurking upon the horizon.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","joshbarton15","26 March 2017","With the major box-office success of something like the Transformers franchise, I'm surprised that it's taken until 2017 to reboot the Power Rangers franchise for a modern audience. An avid viewer of the original television series back in the 90s, there was no way I was going to miss their first big screen appearance in twenty years.When a group of high-school kids; Jason (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly (Naomi Scott), Billy (RJ Cyler), Trini (Becky G) and Zack (Ludi Lin), uncover an ancient spaceship, they discover the power coins they stumbled upon have given them superpowers. Meeting Zordon (Bryan Cranston), via his consciousness that has been uploaded to the ship, they learn that they must harness their new abilities and become the Power Rangers, before the evil Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) destroys all life on Earth.There is no denying that Power Rangers is cinematic trash and the film's biggest flaw is that it doesn't fully embrace the fact that is what it is, leading to the film becoming a complete and utter tonal mess, unable to decide whether it wants to be an edgy superhero film full of teen angst or an all out cheesy superhero film. In the end it chooses to be both and the film really does suffer because of it.This is Power Rangers for crying out loud so I expect the over-the-top cheesy finale that unfolds once they morph for the first time however, when this finale comes after ninety minutes of semi- serious build up, it just doesn't fit together at all. That's another problem this film has; it's way too long, clocking in at just over two hours.The semi-serious side is weighed down by backstories of these misfits who meet while attending Saturday detention but The Breakfast Club this is not. There is way too much baggage attached to these characters, including Billy's autism which was in danger of becoming a gimmick. It's commendable to include such a thing, as well as one of the characters being gay however, there's no need to make such a song and dance about it.There is fun to be had with Power Rangers mind. From the moment they fully become the Power Rangers right through until the end I felt like a 90s kid again sat in front of the television on a Saturday morning. I did find the build up to all of that tolerable it's just I wish they'd have settled on making the rest of the film as batshit crazy as its final act.There isn't really much that can be said about the acting in this film other than the five playing the Power Rangers aren't all that bad and Elizabeth Banks has an absolute ball hamming it up as Rita Repulsa, a villain who has nothing about her except being pure evil, which makes a change for once.Power Rangers didn't disappoint me at all because I wasn't expecting it to be anything but a poor film. My suggestion would be to switch off all brain cells, get the biggest tub of popcorn and just let the insanity take over.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","In one of the many gritty reboots of a nostalgic 1990's franchise, I didn't have much expectation for Power Rangers (2017). The original show was pretty campy, with a tried-and-true plot structure that didn't change much from episode to episode. In fact, I probably couldn't tell you the specific plot of any of the episodes. They'd usually follow this format: the main villain would go about trying to obtain some goal via their minions/henchmen, the Power Rangers would morph and fight the minions/henchmen, the minions/henchmen would grow large and start destroying everything, the Power Rangers would call their Zords out to battle, and (finally) the Zords would combine into the Megazord and the foe would be vanquished.While Power Rangers did follow some of the structure of the television show format, it also managed to create characters with some depth and background to them. From a disgraced football star to an autistic teen who doesn't get jokes to a cyber-bully cheerleader to a (possibly) bisexual loner to a reckless mother's boy, the five teenagers certainly have their share of angst and diversity. I do give kudos to the scriptwriters for including characters that feel distinctly modern without being too preachy about it.And yet, while Power Rangers has a lot going for it, including plenty of action and a modicum of nostalgia, there are still a few flaws. Some of the humor is a bit juvenile, especially for a PG-13 film. I also couldn't help but recognize the quite familiar setup of The Breakfast Club (1985), even to the point where I wanted the film to end with the Red Ranger holding a defiant fist in the air while ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" plays in the background. Was this supposed to be a reboot of The Breakfast Club instead of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers?A surprisingly well-done nostalgic reboot, I give Power Rangers 4.0 stars out of 5.","9/10"
"Power Rangers","Snootz","16 July 2017","While not a ""bad"" movie, one has to realize that a movie named ""Power Rangers"" isn't going to appeal to much of anyone over 10 years of age. But beyond that, this flick is a slow-moving, anti-climatic, dull and insensible let-down of both scripting and directing.On the one hand, unlike Transformers one can always tell what is going on. But that's mainly because very little is going on. From the poorly-choreographed fight scenes to the lame dialog, Power Rangers is a yawner from beginning to end.On a positive note the armored suits were a step-up from the series. No more latex and spandex sissy-suits here; this is some decent (if colorful) battle armor. I would give them thumbs-up on the CGI but face it... at this period of time, basic CGI is old-hat and cliché. Booorrinnng. Not because I'm an action junkie but rather the exact opposite: action without substance is pointless (which is one reason I can't tolerate Transformers).The only thing that could have saved this movie would have been choosing another theme entirely. Then start with a story that's beyond the trite ""bad person wants to destroy everything"" plot, and some characters that are more than 2-dimensional attempts at failed sympathy votes.I would have given this 5 points except for the innuendos that children likely didn't understand and adults would consider and juvenile and offensive bathroom humor. That lost them one star that would have graded the film as ""mediocre"". As it is, 4 stars is generous. Next time people, find a better-quality outdated theme to re-hash. Or at least make a movie that doesn't drive even existing fans to wrist-slashing despair.","10/10"

Sure it has its flaws but they are MINOR compared to how it feels overall.The actors did damn good job portraying the characters we all know and loved.Definitely deserved a sequel and then some, especially considering the teaser for Tommy, the green ranger, at the end.","4/10"
"Power Rangers","ReelLifeReviews","25 March 2017","Power Rangers (2017) - Dust off your Mossimo t-shirts and JNCO jeans, everyone, because if the Power Rangers can make a comeback, anything is possible.I had a lot more fun with this movie than I thought I would. Australian actor Dacre Montgomery led the way as the red ranger and was the standout overall. His role lent to this, but he very easily could have fallen flat. I would expect to see him in more films going forward.There weren't any big names in the new crew, and while some were stronger than others, they did quite well as a whole. They played well off of one another and I bought the group dynamic early on. It did have a few big names in other roles with Brian Cranston, Elizabeth Banks, and Bill Heder. Brian Cranston played a giant head in the wall that is basically just a surly old man the whole time. Elizabeth Banks seemed like she filmed all of her scenes before the producers decided to actually take the project seriously. And Bill Heder does the voice of a cartoon robot mascot that just did not work for me on any level.There are definitely some campy moments and a plot hole or two, but they don't undermine what ends up being a satisfying trip down memory lane. If you weren't a fan of the TV show or had never seen it, this probably isn't the movie for you. But if you are a true kid of the 90's, then Go Go - 6.5/10","7/10"

"Power Rangers","trinaboice","3 April 2017","Grade: C+Rating: PG-13, 124 minutesIn a Nutshell: Does anyone actually care about the Power Rangers anymore? My 4 sons absolutely loved itback in the day, but I didn't think it was even relevant to kids anymore. Seems like just a morphin cash grab to me in more ways than one.Uplifting theme: Friendship, loyalty, teamwork, sacrifice Things I liked: Fans of the Power Rangers will probably enjoy it just for old time's sake. The characters are pretty well fleshed out with back stories, which pleasantly surprised me. The training sequences were pretty fun. Bryan Cranston is awesome in everything. Did you know he actually voiced some of the characters in the original 1990's TV show? Cool. Billy Cranston's character in the movie was actually named after Bryan Cranston. Even cooler. Their outfits have definitely gotten an upgrade.Things I didn't like: Krispy Kreme gets HUGE product placement. Kind of weird, right? Product placement always kind of annoys me, because it's so manipulative and an obvious cash grab. In this case, it's a BIG part of the story line. Did you hear that Krispy Kreme is actually changing the name of the company in England, because customers there can't figure out how to pronounce it correctly? True story. Most of the lead teenagers are super annoying delinquents who are rude, self-absorbed, and whiny. They almost try to out-do each other to see which one of them is least understood and outcast. Even before the five teenagers get their special powers, they're involved in very dangerous activities. These kids are not great role models. Of course, they finally figure out how to work as a team and sacrifice for each other (not a big spoiler alert), but I didn't like most of them. On top of that, they all buy into killing Rita within minutes. Rita Repulsa. What a name. Ha ha. Instead of declaring her intentions to conquer the world or the universe, she pretty much just trashes a little town. Ha ha Elizabeth Banks' accent seemed off, but I appreciate that she was trying to go over-the-top campy like the original TV character did. Some bad editing moments. The original 90's TV show was super cheesy and knew it. That's what made it really fun. This movie mixes up the cheese with serious drama, so it often feels disjointed in tone. For an origin story, it's fairly cliché. There are some really inappropriate jokes. It's kind of like the directors picked out what special effects they wanted to use and then built a story around it.Funny lines: ""Yippee Kayay, Mother Fu.Mother. Mother's good."" – Blue Ranger (R.J.Cyler) ""You five are the Power Rangers!"" – Alpha 5 (Bill Hader) ""Are we like Iron Man or Spiderman?"" – Blue Ranger ""My guess is we have 11 years. No, days. Eleven days."" – Alpha 5 ""I'm pretty sure I'm a super hero."" – Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott) ""Pee in that cup!"" – Kimberly Hart's mom ""Jason, did you just slap her?"" – Blue Ranger ""I did. Weird, right?"" – Jason Lee Scott/Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery) ""Sorry, Bumblebee!"" – Blue Ranger (Transformer reference)Dumb lines: ""Take that!"" – Pink Ranger ""Bring it on!"" – Pink Ranger ""We got this!"" – Pink Ranger ""My family is so normal. Too normal."" – Yellow Ranger (Becky G)Tips for parents: Lots of fighting and destruction. A surprising amount of profanity. There are some subtitles you'll have to read for little ones. There are several inappropriate jokes that will, hopefully, go over the heads of most kids.","9/10"
"Power Rangers","markthomassintek","17 August 2017","POWER RANGERS REVIEWOK honestly I didn't like the TV programmes so came to the film with my mind almost made up, wrong I know because I do pride myself on being independent and impartial when doing these reviews.The film, first half where they basically aquure the powers very enjoyable actually, with each character having a back story but I'm sorry to say that once they aquure their powers and start being the Power Rangers all of the hard work previously building up the story and characters is lost.Second half corny, cheesy and actually a disappointment because....... well if you ever watched the Power Rangers you can predict what's going to happen.Kids will love it but if your a grown up who watched it as a child....... well first half great second half 😞Rating 4 out of 10","6/10"
"Power Rangers","graphicsamdalton","5 January 2018","While stumbling through Netflix I saw this film advertised and was surprised to see a new full feature Power Ranger film had been released. I decided to give it a go and was honestly very pleasantly surprised.Power Rangers was never my favorite show as a child. I was always more into Transformers and Dragonball Z; they were always darker, the fight scenes 
were more intense and less ridiculous than a group of teenagers in silly looking colored coded suits; like a selection of angry crayons fighting against disabled monsters. Being born in 1990, alot of my friends would watch it when I went to their house though so I still feel like it's not only part of my childhood but also something I remember fondly on the whole (although I definitely don't have the same level of fandom some people writing reviews here seem too). The action is good, the Zoids are pretty amazing and I have to agree with another reviewer I actually preferred them to the Micheal Bay Transformers. They are clean and simple, not overly complicated and difficult to distinguish making the fight scenes in them clearer and easier to watch. The Megazoid transformation is great and I thought the level of CGI was quite impressive throughout but not mind blowing. But what made the film great to me was the general moral code of the Power Rangers. It was just... nice. Perhaps this narrative is slightly cliche now, it's a fairly standard action film but I felt it sincere. Troubled kids meet each other by chance/fate/destiny and would sincerely die for each other only after a few days of knowing one another. They love each other and want to do right by each other as friends and as people. They genuinely do not hesitate* to take up the mantle as save others lives like heroes. I think that is admirable, and a great role model for children to look up. The Rangers are also quite identifiable as people, with real teenage troubles that cover a wide spectrum that kids and teens will relate too. The whole lesbian thing with Trini (Yellow Ranger) was very briefly delved into and although Billy (Blue ranger) didn't feel autistic if I'm honest he was still one of the best characters, outside of Alpha.I would give this movie a shot. Try not to be crazy disappointing when you realise this is not a nostalgia trip but more of a reboot and re imagining. There is one nice scene with the power rangers theme that made me smile but outside of that, I don't think you'll get a warm fuzzy buzz from remembering and comparing it to the original Power Rangers. Which is a good thing because the original Power Rangers is terrible and a cheese fest. Enjoy it for what it is; a pretty good action movie for teens, with a feel good message about teamwork, friendship, self-love, personal healing and the power of cooperation.
* Well slightly at first, but they have alot to digest and I'm unsure if I would trust a giant talking head and a strange but very good humored robot. Why they know English is beyond me. But they build robot dinosaurs so maybe instantly picking a language and knowing the personal details of peoples lives is childsplay.","2/10"
"Power Rangers","rtwerk-36870","26 June 2017","I will admit right off the bat that this movie is a perfect example of a pet peeve of mine: sloppy writing. Although it is not entirely the writers' fault. There is only an hour's worth of movie and the rest is padding. We don't see actual Power Rangers until an hour and a half into a two hour movie. If their target audience was 15 year olds, then the crappy story isn't so much of a problem. By the time the Power Rangers finally show up... I've stopped caring. And I didn't think it would be possible, but Elizabeth Banks is totally miscast and downright horrible. I had 15 minutes left on the movie and gave up. Didn't even care how it ended.","5/10"
"Power Rangers","chera_khalid","29 September 2023","Power Rangers, a nostalgic revival that, despite its earnest efforts, left me yearning for more. The young cast gives it their all, but the acting often treads the line between genuine and forced. The film editing attempts to modernize the classic Rangers narrative, but the pacing falters, making the movie feel disjointed. The strength lies in the film's attempt to inject depth into the characters, adding layers to the superhero origin story. However, the weakness lies in the struggle to balance campy nostalgia with a more mature tone, resulting in a tonal mishmash that doesn't quite hit the mark. The music tries to capture the essence of the '90s series, but it occasionally feels out of sync with the updated visuals. Cinematography, while at times visually striking, doesn't fully elevate the film beyond its TV show roots. At 8/10, Power Rangers is a valiant attempt to reignite childhood memories but falls short of morphing into the superhero spectacle it aims to be.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","rs403404","8 April 2017","By the time ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" went big, I was teenager. I have seen random episodes, but my primary takeaways from the series is that the characters don't have discernible personalities beyond being either the good guys or the bad guys, the Power Rangers are incapable of doing anything without a sound effect, the town of Angel Grove should be a battle ground-graveyard from all the Godzilla style battles, and, finally, the Pink Ranger is hot (highly important to teenage me).It's important to understand that I'm not approaching this movie with fond memories of the original. I try not to enter the theater with preconceived notions. However, I did not look forward to this movie- -at all. Bearing that in mind, I was shocked by how much this movie worked and how close it was to being something really special. I say close because some glaring issues held it back. First, the movie's few attempts at humor are cringeworthy. After a solid intro, we soon cut to a beastiality joke. It's a similar joke that worked in ""Kingpin"", but is out of place in this movie. Sadly, the remainder of the jokes play about as well.Second, when the Power Rangers actually become Power Rangers, the movie takes on the feel of a formulaic episode. They fight putties, then a big monster attacks Angel Grove which allows for a big mech vs monster battle. What's interesting is the movie is at it's strongest when we spend time with the title characters. The rangers are portrayed by likable, talented young actors. Consequently, what was a huge weakness for the source material is a strength here. Nevertheless, once the characters morph, that quality mostly disappears inside their costumes.However, that brings us to the third and most glaring major issue and it's not something I usually care about, but it's intense here-- product placement. Comparatively, ""Man of Steel""s placements of IHOPs were downright subtle when viewed alongside the appearances of Krispy Krème in this movie. The product placement first appears about halfway through, starts obvious and quickly becomes obnoxious throughout the remainder of the film. There's even a moment when the villainous Rita Repulsa takes time out of her battle to destroy the world to lovingly eat doughnuts. One can't help but wonder how much Krispy Krème paid for this? Is it possible they are the sole sponsor?These glaring flaws in the midst of what could have been a credible movie make ""Power Rangers"" feel like an opportunity lost. Still, the fact that it is as good as it is when it's based on a series like ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" must be viewed as something of a minor miracle.","1/10"
"Power Rangers","ctowers21","24 March 2017","Power rangers does exactly what it sets out to do. This origin story feels like a breakfast club reboot where the kids get super powers. The relationships in this movie are rarely seen in superhero movies and the actors knock their performances out of the park. All of the story feels real and the audience feels emotionally attached to these characters. The movie is very well directed by Dean Isrealite with all the CGI and background settings looking unlike the power rangers of past. The movie features star like performances from the relatively new faces of the five power rangers with Dacre Montgomery (red), Naomi Scott (pink) and RJ Cyler sticking out. Most of the story is genre defying and sets a tone for the movies to follow,However, Elizabeth banks seems to be completely over acting her entire part. Her cheesy, almost comical representation of Rita make it seem like she is in a different movie and with a completely different tone than the five power rangers along with zordon (played by Bryan Cranston). Her cheesy dialog and facial expressions bring down this movie and makes the audience think what could have been.Overall, this movie has a great amount of heart and tremendous performances from some soon to be stars that leaves the audience craving sequels to this could be great franchise, even with the miss by Elizabeth banks. Whether you were a fan of the original TV show or have no prior knowledge, people will get what they are hoping for out of this potentially massive success of a franchise.","5/10"
"Power Rangers","mitesh-12997","18 June 2017","Considering how awful the TV Power Rangers are, this movie was quite good. The story line starts off well, explains the characters back grounds and who they are and then goes into how they become the power rangers. The middle part of the film did drag on, felt like the writers and directors ran out of things to fill it with, we get they need training but to much of it filled the middle part of the film. The end section had great fight scenes, went well with the overall story and set in motion for future movies. Overall, good start that could have been something tragic like the ghost busters remake. Worth watching once though, wouldn't watch again as its one of those movies, watched once then forgotten.","8/10"

"Power Rangers","autisticreviewers","23 March 2017","For all those people that aren't aware this is a reboot of the Power Rangers. It has nothing to do the original ones. The Power Rangers have been around now for a long time and only 2 of their movies have made it to the big screen ""Mighty Morphin Rangers Movie"" and ""A Turbo Rangers Movie."" This is the third Power Rangers movie brought to the Screen. Also being a PG-13 Rated movie really says a lot. It's obvious to expect a bit more full on action and violence.First of all the acting was not that great. But that's not too surprising as the Power Rangers series and movies were never about great acting. Elizabeth Banks and the voices of Bill Hader and Bryan Cranston really did steal the entire show. While it didn't save the film they were definitely the highlights. The CGI was pretty bad. We both imagine that some scenes would look great in 3-D, a lot of it involving slow motion and car crashes. But the CGI was not really an update to the year 2017. it's obvious they were trying to also keep it like the good old Fox Kids days, but it it looked like it was trying to look good at the same time.If you really are looking to spend a weekend out with your family or grew up watching and loving the Power Rangers there is a chance you may feel like a good kid again, but all in all while the movie did have its moments of good it just really isn't worth seeing in the cinema. Maybe try renting it on Netflix when it's out. That's not to say other people will love it and enjoy it. We're sure others will adore this film, but for us it didn't quite hit the mark. The Autistic Reviewers give this 2/5 stars. 5/10. Check us out on facebook or Instagram. Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers.","7/10"
"Power Rangers","timfongmk","25 March 2017","I went into the theater expecting a gritty reboot, but the film surprised me with its lighthearted humor and characters who wear their hearts on their sleeves.I am glad, that, unlike other reboots of beloved franchises in recent years, Power Rangers 2017 never pretentiously strives to be more than its source material, or reinvent the wheel. In doing so, it manages to capture some of the spirit of the original series, although there were times the lack of gravitas gave me the feeling of a made for TV movie. But alas, the cheesy set up, the straight forward storytelling, and unlikely friends overcoming the odds was part of the charm of the original power rangers, and retaining these elements is no sin in my book.Despite the main cast being teens, I felt the camaraderie the humor (especially from Billy, a subdued, modern day Steve Urkel), was just believable and entertaining enough to shape the rangers into likable characters without too much annoying angst or soap. Breakfast Club Lite, if you will. The trade off is its all a bit cloying and somewhat limited in its exploration of the team's individual personalities.To balance out the feel good teens, Elizabeth Banks is fabulously fun as the nasty (literal) golddigger vilainess Rita Repulsa, straddling the fine line between gross, evil, and over the top corny, with a bit of sexy thrown in. Almost any scene in the movie with her involved is a highlight.But alas, for the nerd in me, this movie's biggest sin is that there's not enough ranger action. Or any action, period. With a training montage and a few brief fights sprinkled in between, the movie only brings out the big guns for its finale. The Power Rangers in their suits barely get any fighting in against poorly designed enemies that block out much of the screen much of the time. And when it all finally goes to hell, the final setpiece is disappointingly on the generic side, in a post Michael Bay Transformers sort of way. Large CG metal and rock pieces flash across the screen without the viewer really able to distinguish the details, a far cry from the low budget but excellently choreographed sentai action sequences from the original Japanese production.Ultimately, Power Rangers 2017 is the most expensive made for Saturday morning TV movie you will ever watch. Those looking for deep world building, a sharply written script, or jam packed back to back action scenes will not find it here. But those hoping to relive their childhood for a couple hours, and maybe introduce their little on to it, might find a lot of heart and a silly fun time to be had.","5/10"

I won't write a long unnecessary review, just know I was never a Power Rangers fan and now I am most certainly thankful for that! Elizabeth Banks as always, she rocks! I love her. However, this was two hours completely wasted as 90% of the movie is us watching these teens discover their powers and themselves (sort of). There's barely any comedy and the last few minutes is just packed with uncomfortable action scenes and CGI. Watch if your bored....","8/10"
"Power Rangers","FallenEye","22 January 2018","The story never needed to be unprecedented or filled with twists, it just needed to be a simple ""kids turning into superheroes and saving the world"", and I'm glad that that's exactly what they did, however still in taking that simple route, Power Rangers was missing texture and focus.That simple story with magnificent execution would've turned this movie all the way up, but Dean got lost in trying to draw emotion, create a connection, add humour and showcase spectacular action sequences, and frustratingly kept falling short every time.The sound mixing, sound editing and score were almost amateur, and the direction and cinematography (especially with the final battle) was, terrible really, and the combination of all I just mentioned created these awkward gaps throughout the movie.The beginning of the movie is pretty fun though. These kids who don't know each other from a bar of soap, discovering a new world and powers while living our childhood fantasy of heroism and secrecy... It really just needed to be that simple.It sucks that this film wasn't as good as it really could've been, especially because Power Rangers has all it needs to be an epic series. Perhaps if we're lucky, Lionsgate may want to give that sequel a shot, because our interest is still there, but they'll have to bring it twice, three times as hard this time around. 5.4/10.","4/10"
"Power Rangers","monstermayhem32","28 March 2017","I will say when watching the mighty morphin power rangers series as a kid, it was campy and cheesy as hell but also lots of fun, in that version as well as this version, deals with the original five Rangers, Jason, Trini, Zachary, billy, and Kimberly, however they are different version of the TV counterparts since trini is a hispanic lesiban, Zach is Asian, and Billy is black while suffering from aspergers. Rita repulse also returns but was once a rogue green power rangers who wants the zeo crystals as a way of gaining more power. She is also more evil and insane than she was in the TV series.

"Power Rangers","michaelbaltazar-31857","30 September 2017","To me, I don't think that the new power rangers movie was all that bad because it is only the first movie which they have to introduce everybody for one and also they have to get all the newer viewers up to date with the older movies and last they want to also make it entertaining for the new generation. I'm only 19 and I hate to say it but this new generation isn't like the 90's. There are more kids know that are into this new behavior that you saw in the movie. For example with the cursing and dirty jokes and other things like that, is what kids now a days are into. I just graduated high school so I know a little of how the kids in this generation react to and what there into. I really think they should continue with the next seven movies if it actually comes to that many because know that the first movie with the introduction is over there may also be more action and more things that will make the series more popular with the next movies. I am a little interested in what they plan on doing with people that were in the original TV series and movies. For example Bulk and skull and others. Although, the movie may have been bad to other people to me it lived up to my expectations.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","kermitkid","30 March 2020","To be honest, I got pretty much what I expected with this movie. I thought at best it would be average, and at worst it would be a dumpster fire, like ""Fant4stic"". And yeah, it was perfectly average. A lot could have been improved, changed, and taken out, but at the end of the day, I was entertained. I wasn't checking how much runtime was left, or praying for the sweet release of the end credits, but I wouldn't exactly recommend this film to anybody either. It's entertaining, but not exactly a film I'm clamoring to watch again. The film did suffer from a lot of problems. The chemistry between the 4 leads was awful. The runtime is 2 hours and 15 min, and for a movie called ""Power Rangers"" and it takes almost 2 hours of that for them to actually become the Power Rangers. Instead, they fill up the time with teen angst and drama. It felt like I was watching a Disney Channel movie or something on Freeform. There was one part where a character supposedly died, but I honestly didn't care because not enough time was spent on their character development. I was indifferent to what happened to these characters. Also, they hired Bryan Cranston, but just like in 2014's ""Godzilla,"" he's barely in it, and his talent is wasted. Bill Hader got more screentime. Bill Hader! I like Bill Hader, but in small incriments. He was in this wasy too much. By far, the best part of the movie was Elizabeth Banks' performance as the villain. She went over-the-top without overdoing it. Just a classic Saturday morning cartoon style villain who enjoys being evil for the sake of being evil. The first half of the movie did give me a sense of deja vu, as it felt a little too much like someone was trying to do a remake of ""Chronicle."" There are very few times where I praise the score of a movie, but I have to here. I loved the score. It sounded like the soundtrack to ""Tron: Legacy."" I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters, but it was worth a rent. If you're at Redbox, and this is in stock, and there's nothing else you want to see, it's worth at least one watch.

Naturally, it was only a matter of time before it was reconstituted into a feature film and inflicted upon the poor old unsuspecting world.But unfortunately, this reboot strains so hard to distance itself from the original TV series, it could spoil your childhood memories.Plot: High school outcasts Jason Scott/Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly/Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott), Billy/Blue Ranger (RJ Cyler), Zack/Black Ranger (Ludi Lin), Trini/Yellow Ranger (Becky G.) stumble upon an old alien ship, where they acquire superpowers and are dubbed the Power Rangers. Learning that an old enemy of the previous generation has returned to exact vengeance, the group must harness their powers and use them to work together and save the world.My Review: To go through everything wrong with Power Rangers will require more typing than there is time in the world. Its most unforgivable sin is that IT'S SO BORING.It really should not be that hard to inject life into a story about five high school kids with superpowers.Yet, it takes 90 minutes for the heroes to get suited up - which for anyone hoping to see a film about Power Rangers will not seem fair and to make it worse a theme song plays in background ""Go!Go!Power Rangers""(Should I have to go away and quit watching this?). Even then, they almost instantly get into their dinosaur-shaped Zord vehicles for the remainder of the film. That means we get to watch the actors reacting in cockpits. We watch them making ""Wow"" faces. What... a... thrill.And the major problem is that it seriously tries to impress adults by some crude remarks which are totally out-of-place and the movie was supposed to be PG.Well the female rangers' suits are worse – the whole focus of the women's costumes becomes their breasts (when the original didn't even have this sort of sexualisation).The only pro of this movie is its cast.The ace of the five is Cyler (eternally great in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl), who brings a manic energy and big heart to the picture as Billy. Even in such confused trash as this, he's a bonafide star.Others are also very good.So,Power Rangers really makes us question ""Who the heck asked for this crappy reboot""? My Rating 4.75/10","9/10"

This was fantastically done I pulled for the kids and wanted the bad guy dealt with
Elizabeth banks and Bryan Cranston (stud)
I wanted more. I love the underdog - don't wanna be hero genre It wants you waiting for the next installment. The young and upcoming actors melted with the established. Smelling franchise. I hope they do more","6/10"
"Power Rangers","SyoKennex","7 January 2020","I was just going to leave a half funny comment on this and leave but I can't.First of All, Zordon being a dick? Bryan Cranston did an amazing job as Zordon but being a twat to the Rangers because he's grumpy about being locked up? That's not Zordon. That is everything Zordon is not.And Kimberly????? Kimberly is a kind hearted girl who would babysit disabled children, learned and taught sign language for her deaf cousin and taught kids gymnastics even when she was busy. Sure she can be a bit stuck up at times but Kimberly is NOT the type of girl to send someone's nudes around school? She's a very rarely sometimes sort of stuck up popular girl but she's NOT the kind of girl to do that? At all? She's the kind of girl who would defend whoever this happened to. She wouldn't ridicule someone like that.The suits??? What the hell was the suits???? They were using everyone's original suit designs so I don't get why they had to sci-fi/cyber them up? The original suits in slightly off colour (darker pink, lighter yellow, etc) would have worked just fine. Also why are their faces reveleased in the Zords? The Rangers never had their face on show incase of emergency, ie their zord got wrecked, leaving them without a helmet covering their face.
Also Kimberly's Zord burning and her struggling? It's been proven in numerous form of the PR universe that Zords have mechanics incase of this? It was a pathetic call back to Kimberly being a damsel in distress.Did the director see a single piece of the Power Rangers verse before this film? I see the way he was trying to go for this film but it fell massively flat.The 2 stars are for Ludi Lin and RJ Cyler, the original theme being used when they first the Zords, and for the Megazord not looking like crap.The fact this is some kids first ever viewing of the PR verse breaks my heart.","6/10"

"Power Rangers","pfranqueiro","19 June 2021","The action scenes are very well shot and choreographed, the development and interaction between the characters is perfect, as well as being wonderfully interpreted. The only one that can be attributed to it is that some characters, especially secondary ones, fall into the typical clichés of teen cinema.What prevents the film from being excellent is the terrible villain, because she overreacts that she borders on the ridiculous, the character has little development and her motivations are limited to the cliché of wanting to dominate the universe.","4/10"
"Power Rangers","austin0731","30 March 2017","Power rangers is the modern rendition of the classic TV series of the same name and reimagines the cheesy franchise into a modern more serious version. It stars 5 teenagers, 'outsiders' and 'misfits' as they are joined together by fate and are tasked to become the 'Power Rangers' a superhero team tasked with protecting these 'Zeo crystals'.The movie really was building up to be a very well done and emotionally investing superhero origin story but everything really goes downhill after the team 'suits up' in its final act to battle the villain played by Elizabeth Banks, the evil Rita Repulsa hell bent on destroying this small town and eventually the world? So as I said, I really liked the first half of this film where we really get to sympathize with these characters, they were both likable and relatable, especially the blue ranger who I was really afraid would reel towards the annoying side, I am glad that it didn't go that way. The film had a more serious tone and had real emotional moments which I as one who has not seen the originals suspect was not a theme in the originals at all. This was all great and all and I really wished this trend had carried through the entire film. However once we are introduced to Rita Repulsa who acts as this over the top and ridiculous character the film starts to go down hill. The power rangers battle these golem things that she summons and that fight choreography is seriously flawed and uninspiring. You could argue that this was trying to stay true to the series' over the top cheesy aura but then why would you build up the first half to be such a more mature film?So to finalize, I must conclude that this is a pretty good attempt to revive the franchise and is a solid first film for potential sequels. I really enjoyed what they did in the first half of this film so I do hope that this is what they stick to in the future.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","FelipeCarrillo","20 July 2017","It's clear that with the passing of the years our sphere is transfigured and our outlook on life is attached with the presented updates. The 1990s supposed a range of cinematographic parables and personalities with mere budgetary intentions, however, these products built infancy and youth of men and women with a mixture of eyewash and absurdity dressed up in laughable clothes. In simultaneous, these ones established the foundations of contemporary pop-culture by means of certain patterns and artistic commercial manifestations. Haim Saban created, set up and distributed a show intended for young audiences with the verbose title ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", a series based on the Japanese saga ""Super Sentai Series"" and won an incredible success not only in English speaking countries, but around the world, achieving the status of popular icon. Later, there were two more rounds of episodes and two audiovisual productions inciting the fervent appreciation for the the quintet of teens who fought in Japan but resided in the United States. Today, Dean Israelite presents the third in the franchise, which is an installment that feeds American leisure to create modernizations of films which generated a determined impact in past ages, only this time, curiously, the process is reversed: The 2017 graphics aren't the most important renovation in the story are the treatment and conception of the coming-of-age characters which stand out on screen, where action/adventure sequences, by which the most avid spectators attended movie theaters (adding a dose of pure nostalgia around the series and original film), are placed in the penultimate position in order of importance, anomalous statement keeping in mind Hollywood's cinematic predilections.First and foremost, the weight of transforming a visually cartoonish concept into an interesting and coherent plot falls on screenwriter John Gatins, undeniably. Gatins doesn't shake off giving stereotyped profiles to the leading roles, but he gets rid of showing them in a methodical and jerky way, he provides sketched characters to the indicated interpreters, in addition, keeps a surprising fidelity leaving intact the basic components. It's a shame that this fierce and warlike harmony of introduction isn't injected into all the feature film. The various situations that it inserts around the characters, which serve to reveal who or what they're, are known, but acceptable, and in certain instants are enjoyable such as the campfire scene or in which knacks of the young cast are evidenced, not in overblown effects or plot twists, circumstances where the soul is naked and the ears are wide open. Second, the film falls on the shoulders of Dean Israelite, not very frequented filmmaker to direct a blockbuster of that caliber, but he's an expert executing a carefree tone. Perhaps, Lionsgate made this signing as an incentive, in order to the director, provides part of tone and form of the story of travels through time to the idea. It's clear, Israelite doesn't possess the required acuity to express with panache and subtlety the key action sequences, therefore, he prioritizes the characters, which is an appropriate determination. However, when you're responsible for carrying out a mega-production, you must lead every minimum job with a successful tact. Abrupt pace changes in certain scenes, hand-held shots, and fast cuts make it intelligible and unenjoyable what should be enjoyable; the visual effects are decent and the new designs of the costumes, the Zords, and the Megazords aren't entirely bad.Last but not least, it's the heterogeneous casting. Israelite and his the crew took their time to find the favorable actors, and they found them. They opted, thank goodness, not to select a rubicund stereotyped woman or American husky heartthrob, the chosen ones are facing favorably unknown, unknown but with many talents to explore. Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Ludi Lin and Becky G. are officially the new Power Rangers, those that could be the popular icons of the post-millennium generation, although it's an uncertain future, with Marvel and DC monopolizing the sector at present.In addition to the newcomers and their laborious performances, it's only two great stars are meddled within the novice cast: Elizabeth Banks, trying to replace the new Teffie from ""The Hunger Games"" and Bryan Cranston, who runs a fascinating prolog but a bittersweet appearance on a wall.Everyone feared with what Dean Israelite could do, who could destroy a franchise and a pop icon in pieces with the fire of his ambitions or could expand the radar and get a handful of fans who support the invention of more adventures with Saban's team. The director is placed in the middle of the bifurcation. Visually, it doesn't take advantage of all its possibilities, being severely affected by the dizzying frenzied scenes, however, we can affirm that the area of characters is as well sketched as presented, successfully introduced, opening the door to a couple of doses more of Morphin' Time. With two unforgettable scenes and the interesting new Rangers, Dean Israeli's ""Power Ranges"" isn't the hollow popcorn movie we expected, however, it's not what we weren't looking forward to; a super production that falls in certain details with what failed in ""Fox's F4ntastic"" in 2015, but surprisingly gives the protagonism to those who really belong it, the heroes.","1/10"
"Power Rangers","ttttony-18640","5 April 2018","I took my family to this (young kids who love the tv show), only to discover a wannabe teenage drama with 'themes' that tries way too hard. You can still have a good movie with teenagers as the main character without having all the 'Hollywood teenager' behaviour a of rebellion against parents, drinking, making dangerous decisions that get people killed and stripping down to your bra onscreen. Not everyone is a melodramatic whiner that has these Hollywood cliche problems. (He said after whining about the movie)All that aside, it took forever for the real power ranger action to happen. The movie was like; 1hr 45mins of teenage drama then finally some power ranger action which did not follow the same serious tone the rest of the movie had. They should've had a more lighthearted build up, allow the rangers to use their powers for lesser threats in a 'training sort of way' and then the big battle.","8/10"
"Power Rangers","MrPupkin","3 December 2019","I grew up on Power Rangers, I always loved them, even as an adult I re-watch Mighty Morphin' about once a year. But it's never been ""good"", so for 2017's Hollywood go-over to even come across as well as it did is impressive, but still, in keeping with history, Power Rangers is not ""good"". And where it fails hardest is in its most Power-Ranger-iest moments. Before Rita Repulsa, and the Ranger suits and the quote unquote epic showdown at Krispy Kreme (which by the way is probably the most heinous example of product placement I've ever seen), I was actually pretty on board, sure the acting was hit and miss at best, but as characters I was interested to follow their dynamic. Unfortunately, this is at best half the film, and even this half isn't perfect.","6/10"

"Power Rangers","Spideyfan-963-246215","15 August 2017","Power Rangers (2017) Starring: Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, Ludi Lin, Becky G, RJ Cyler, Elizabeth Banks, Bryan Cranston, Bill Hader, David Denman, Sarah Grey, Matt Shively, Anjali Jay, Morgan Taylor Campbell, Erica Cerra, and Robert Moloney Directed By: Dean Israelite Review TOGETHER WE ARE MORE I am not a fan of Power Rangers, they're obviously just a rip-off of Ultraman which I find to be far better. If you don't know what Ultraman is look it up its the same thing but in Japan. Saban's Power Rangers follows five ordinary teens who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove — and the world — is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so, they will have to overcome their real-life issues and before it's too late, band together as the Power Rangers. I was mainly watching this for the action and fight scenes which they're very little of in this movie. It does have a cool opening sequence with Rita killing the other rangers on some far away planet, I'd like too see that movie instead of this one it looked a lot more interesting than the actual movie itself. Jason is getting into trouble by stealing a cow(what the heck) and ends up in detention meets Billy, they find the ranger crystals with three other teenagers on the mountains Zach, Trixi and Kimberly. When they decide to go back because they become super strong after having been in a car crash they soon discover a spaceship underground where Alpha five voiced by Bill Hader is there to greet them. Zordon is awaken and tells that Rita Repulsa is coming to collect gold to build Goldon(I think it was called) and will destroy the earth. I liked some of the actors like Bill Hader as Alpha five was cool and Bryan Cranston but not the main squad. They just seemed forgettable the only memorable one is Trixi and that's just because she's played by Becky G who's just hot. I liked Elizabeth Banks costume and performance as Rita Repulsa, even if she was one dimensional as a villain I really didn't care. I don't know anything about Power Rangers except that was stupid cheesy and fun, this movie tries to be that but fails. I mean it should have been forty to fifty minutes in and see the suits and I mean all of them not just one but no we got wait through teenage bull that looks like Chronicle. I'm giving Power Rangers a 4 out of 10.","1/10"
"Power Rangers","idunhaveaid","23 March 2017","Great movie! Most people giving it bad reviews are those who have disdain for younger audiences or that just wanted an Transformes/Avengers-like movie with only fighting and no character development. I was amazed at how good the movie was, given I've read some reviews previous to go watching it. It is pretty solid, self-contained and with some references for hardcore fans to get. The focus of the movie is the kids and not their powers or shooting lasers and fighting for half of the movie. Unlike many of the same genre, it actually have proper character development and show us believable emotions. Great movie, overall.","7/10"

"Power Rangers","itspax","1 April 2017","oh boy i was a fan of power rangers when i was a kid, at least from the first once, later they really sucked and i stopped watching them. i saw and really liked the 95 96 movie as kid... but this new film is just the worst movie I've seen in 2017. nothing really fits in. on the other hand its totally placed in 2017, but there are so many 90s references and cheesy moments, it just doesn't fit in the movie at all. its kinda boring, lame and annoying. kids will hate the power rangers, they wont understand why their parents liked them when they were kids... and grown ups will ask themselves, what they liked about power rangers at all in the first place.","5/10"
"Power Rangers","recca01982","30 June 2017","I will be completely honest here. This movie,... I went into with little to no hope for. I've seen the trailers, seen the leaks and heard friends who saw it in theaters. This movie was garbage. Going into it expecting the awesome rangers I grew up with, was my own fault, I will freely admit that.But let's start it out with how they started the movie. Within the first five minutes there's an implied moment where a GENIUS of a friend to Jason ""milked"" a male ""cow"". Let's go ahead and ignore that the supposed leader of the power rangers was committing a crime. Then proceeds to follow up said crime by running from the cops in a twisting camera of nausea. He then avoids the police and gets into a car accident, and proceeds to blame the freaking world over his issues by,.... BEING ANGST FILLED.To be honest, around this time I wanted to turn it off. The acting was pretty poor in terms of quality, and the interactions if you could call it that, were few and far definitely meant only to try to make a sense of teamwork that wasn't there.I could go on and on to nit pick this whole movie apart with how poop filled it was. But I'll simply leave it with these points.Action 1.5/5 - Few and far between. There's maybe two action scenes,... one in the ""pit"" (a safe place for the teens to train against things that would otherwise KILL them), and the end of the movie where it's painful to even watch. The CG of this fight is cringe worthy for 2017, and their one liners are completely ridiculous.Comedy 1.5/5 - This movie tried to make humor in EVERY situation it could. Which lead to some seriously bad timing in terms of lead up. Such as fighting for the life of the universe. It was unnecessary considering it TRIED to make itself super dark in terms of the movie.Plot 2.5/5 - Typical plot, not good or bad, it's power rangers.Overall, a complete avoid. I'm kind of upset I paid $4 for this movie, and it isn't a rental so I can't get rid of it from my digital library.","10/10"
"Power Rangers","the_remixer08","28 March 2017","Even though this story is mostly based on character development, I believe they did a really good job keeping it entertaining for the new generation's introduction to them, as well as the original fans. I love the twist, and the signs of positive diversity with switching around the races of the characters. Even with the ethnic background being switched, the actors did an amazing job bringing the same personality traits to that particular ranger.I give it a 7 out of 10 only because the excitement in me wished they would have started in on the action a bit sooner, but like I said, it was still entertaining at the most so there is no heavy complaint in my book.Looking forward to part two with us getting to meet the new green ranger. Whether it is a boy or girl, they have some pretty big shoes to fill.THUMBS UP!","8/10"
"Power Rangers","jephtha","8 July 2017","For those that knew it as their first big franchise, Power Rangers will always hold some appeal. I happen to fall into this camp. Though a lapsed fan at best and fully aware of the series' constant dismissal of conventional critical standards, it brings a distinct, Saturday morning feeling that perhaps we'd all like to rekindle on occasion. With numerous old properties being re-launched, and often being botched, it really is about time this one got a shot at the modern age. The result is the first worthwhile adaptation of its type in a long time, and perhaps a little more.It's important to keep in mind that this film was made primarily for those at least passingly familiar with the series. I don't see it drawing in too many new, serious-minded followers; it won't serve as the crown-pleasing introduction that Star Trek (2009) was. But this should in no way denounce what the movie has accomplished. Admittedly, there are many bothersome things scattered throughout. I'm not a fan of Dean Isrealite's semi-hand-held camera-work and multiple plot elements don't add up, but these things don't significantly mar the proceedings. Compared to the stuff in the original series, this is a notable step in the right direction.In addition to providing recognizable new iterations of old faces, ""Power Rangers"" shows effort in bringing substance and dimension to its key players and a distinct visual flair for its fantastical elements. For a film tasked with establishing five key players, it does a commendable job of distinguishing each one, and the cast infuses them with more than enough humanity to keep us engaged; redefining them as misfits and screw-ups was an inspired decision. The story of how they become heroes is fraught with clichés and conventions of the superhero genre, but the good news is that this is one of the better applications of the formula. The team building segments are better than those from ""The Avengers"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", possibly because the group is actively working towards a goal rather than just waiting around for the big push at the end. Simple actions like speedily passing notes during detention or sparring over the last café pastry add much.There seemed to be much fuss over the film's take on Rita. While Elizabeth Banks does go over-the-top in some scenes and there are multiple hints at a backstory that is never explored, the villainess serves her purpose adequately. She lacks substance, but she's intimidating and formidable, two qualities that the original version of the character badly needed. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed Bill Hader's take on Alpha 5. While the robot's new CGI look is not very appealing, has some genuinely funny lines, and even delivers some brief action. Bryan Cranston provides a suitably sullener take on Zordon, though his voice is a little too recognizable.Action is mostly limited to the final half-hour or so, which may understandably irk some viewers. The ground combat sequence with the Rangers taking on the golem-like putties includes a cool skirmish through a suspended lake, but leaves one wishing for more. Initially, I found the designs for the Zords to be off-putting, but I've gotten used to them, and actually found the scenes of them in action to be more enjoyable on repeat viewings. However, those machine-gun weapons are uninspired. As for the suits, they've got a nice alien quality, particularly from those galaxy-like displays and lights. Angel Grove provides an unusually small backdrop for the climax, but this was probably a conscious decision to avoid collateral damage based criticisms. Regardless, the sequel needs a bigger setting. That's where these types of characters can truly thrive.This is a time of franchise reboots and resurgences. While that's often not the best thing, it's always exciting to see the return of a beloved property. For the longest time, projects such as ""Digimon Adventure Tri"" seemed like an impossibility, and certainly no one expected another Power Rangers feature. This upgrade leaves me optimistic for once.","7/10"

The directing, there well some scenes that was shoot well while the most thriller and action part was not presented very well in the movie. The sound effects were amazing.

"Power Rangers","thepriceofpayne","17 June 2018","Power Rangers is already a tough film for me to review, see I grew up on the Power Rangers and have always been a HUGE fan. Thanks to Power Rangers I was introduced to many comic book characters, which in turn introduced me to comic book films, which in turn introduced me to Film in its own right, so I've got a lengthy history. Also when I say I grew up on Power Rangers, I didn't grow up on one particular incarnation, thanks to cousins and brothers who grew up in the 90s I had tapes and DVDs of almost every season of Power Rangers. One of my favorites being the original of course. So going into this film I had seen the entire original series as a kid as well as all of its other incarnations. That said this is a good film. To begin the Performances are fantastic the entire group of Rangers give some well rounded three dimensional characters even more depth, which brought me a lot of surprises. The film has since had me following the careers of Montgomery, Cyler, Scott, Gomez, and Lin and they've just continued to evolve as actors. Next the suit designs are great and the action/visuals are great as well. Thanks to a nice story and Israelites direction. However that doesn't excuse other moments. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks are fantastic actors, but Cranston is just given exposition lines and Banks is acting like she's in another film completely. Also the film didn't really mix the strong character moments well with the Power Rangers moments. It's like you need to watch the film as two halves not one whole. There are moments where the dialogue is off and the soundtrack (while good) distracts from the film, and it's very nice score. All in all the film has much more heart and love than the Ninja Turtles and Transformers films, but you can tell someone just wasn't too sure of the direction, and with the origin story it's harder to delve into greater moments. I personally love the film and hope it garners a sequel, but I can see why someone wouldn't like it that much. Especially some of the original fans, a die-hard ranger fan such as myself might like it more due to the many incarnations of Power Rangers, but for people who grew up on the Classic MMPR series, you may have a harder time. But if you look past nostalgia you'll find a fun Power Rangers film.","8/10"

"Power Rangers","zordmaker","25 March 2017","OK. First lets set the stage. I worked on the first (1995) Power Rangers movie, creating the zords and a fair bit of the art department wizardry. Power Rangers goes back a long way for me, having not just been a mad fan of the show but also having been given the opportunity to shape and mould that PR universe of long ago.So it was indeed with apprehension that I entered a darkened theater 22 years later to sit and watch what they have now done to our little baby that started it all. Along with my 13 year old daughter who'se name is unashamedly Kimberley.Right away the opening scene had me hooked. This film is very much a complete re imagining of the concept from scratch. It has little to do with the past. It's dark and gritty.. but not too dark and gritty. It goes to great lengths to explain character back story which is something most MMPR fans would know featured as a glaring absence in previous work with this property.There were a lot of our original rules that this film breaks. Initially I feared this would doom Power Rangers, as it has done many other superhero film ""reboots"" of late who chose not to stay faithful to original concepts and designs.Our rule about not seeing the face of morphed rangers - broken. But in it's place, finally.. an explanation as to what ""being a Ranger"" really IS all about.This film is daring in design. It will delight ALL traditional fans AND new viewers. In many ways this is the Power Rangers film we always wished we could have made back in 1995 had we been given the chance or the time.This film works. It makes sense. Before long I stopped caring about the differences between new and old and became immersed in this 21st century version. Yes Alpha looks terrible - but sounds fantastic. And yes, the 21st Century rangers DO look much better than our 20th century attempts.Yes I had to pinch myself a few times when the third act played out almost exactly the same way as our original did.""Power Rangers"" is a great film for today. It stands on it's own feet. I am happy to see that Junior has finally grown up. Anyone who knows me will tell you I'm a hard nut to crack, especially when it comes to something as close to me as Power Rangers.However this film cracks that nut with ease. It sets us up for multiple sequel opportunities and no doubt will spawn a new found interest both in new and old by most who see it. There's some genuinely new concepts in there and finally, some respect for the strong characters that captured so many fans of the original both young and old.The only thing missing from this film is (perhaps) more of the morphed Rangers, which we don't see until the third act begins. The villain (Rita) is perhaps a little too dark and no match for Paul Freeman's delightful and witty ""Ivan Ooze"" in our original. Her minions (affectionately known as putties) are little more than copies of our own ""rock creatures"" from 1995 and really not much of a match for the new Rangers.The opening scene (set in the distant past) clearly show both Zordon and Rita are naked after their armor is released and yet for the Rangers we still see the armor built over the top of their street clothes. It's a shame this mystery of the ""morphing process"" built into the opening scene couldn't be extended into the all important creation of the new rangers a millennia or so later.Ultimately and despite the radical departure from our original designs, I enjoyed this Power Rangers reboot, as did ""Kimberley"". I find my old ""ranger fandom"" given a new boost of energy in this version and look forward to the next chapter in the MMPR story.And finally, I sit satisfied that the new film dared not to create a new Megazord Cockpit, choosing instead to leave the rangers in their own zord cockpits when the giant is formed.I guess they just can't improve on perfection, eh?","7/10"
"Power Rangers","liam_nb","7 April 2020","If your expectations are low you'll probably enjoy this movie as a standard action flick with decent characterization but if I took a deep dive into why i think it doesn't live up to the Power Rangers name it would of course be the fact it tried to be way too dark in some parts and Elizabeth Banks terrible villain also the cuttaway everytime she does something I know why they did it but at the same time it's a practice in movies I hate, basically this movie tried to modernize power rangers and do a marvel approach to it it still had some of that classic ridiculousness but not enough to get a 10/10 so if your a fan if say your more likely to hate this if you've never seen power rangers this will probably be alright for you.
The only good change though is not making the black ranger black and yellow ranger Asian cos that was so weird in the original show bordering on offensive.","1/10"

I hope the sequel is good or even better because I think there is a lot with the storyline that they can do with it.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","Randomgirl111","9 July 2021","I'm gonna get the best thing about this film out of the way first and why the rating isn't any lower (since this character was quite prominent): the autism representation! As an aspie myself, I applaud the writers for actually creating such a likeable character that I could connect myself to. Unlike other representations, Billy (the aspie) isn't one-dimensional. The writers actually realised that autism is a mental condition, NOT a personality trait. Yes, Billy is autistic. But that doesn't mean he lacks empathy, courage, maturity, patience or teamwork skills. Autism also doesn't stop him from being a power ranger. What makes Billy a really believable representation of autism to me is, unlike Music where Sia used autism as an excuse to not develop Music's character and personality, Billy's autism gave him not just some of the challenges of autism (difficulty in understanding sarcasm and jokes, repetitive behaviour, lack of social skills) but also some of the positives of autism (high intellect, great imagination, he's brilliant at the hobbies he's into, like making gadgets and adjusting them etc) but he also has other traits which show that, even if autism is part of who he is, it doesn't make up 100% of who he is. Traits include: great mediator, great team player, great team leader (why wasn't he the red ranger), great friend, passionate about superheroes, completely selfless, curious, super epic fighter, caring and so on. Billy is literally not just my new favourite aspie in any type of media. But he's also one of the most likeable and well written characters I've seen in the last 10 years. I can literally see him a role model for aspies to either look up to or relate to. I would say that every other character in the movie was kinda dull. I honestly think 98% of the time, Billy was carrying the all of the heart or the movie. This brings us to one problem I had while watching this film: the rest of the main cast. Why? Because the rest of the main cast are either unlikable, stupid, bland or all of the above. And no. Then quickly explaining their sob stories does not give them any depth. Yes, Billy's dad died but he had a likeable personality and layers to his character. No other character has that. The rest of the cast is so unremarkable that I've already forgotten their names. The red power ranger is an idiot who does reckless, stupid stuff without a reason (e.g. Steals a cow, crashes a car), is angsty with his dad (who is rightfully upset with him) for no reason at all and is overly aggressive for, again, no reason, the yellow and pink rangers are just bland and under-developed and the black power ranger is so annoying, stupid and stubborn (in a bad way) that I wanted to knock some sense into him by punching his smug face. Like, why did he hop into the obviously dangerous-looking, enormous, robotic dino when he knew he was still training to be a ranger? I was also kinda disappointed that the power rangers didn't get their armour and stuff until the finale of the film. Luckily, there are still good things about the film, besides Billy, that made it engaging enough for me to keep watching. I'll admit the suits themselves (apart from the out of place mouth pieces), the effects, the action, the zoids were cool though. I also think the story structure itself was executed quite well and engaging to watch, the humour was funny, the cheesy tone was true to the original tv shows, the villian is entertaining and threatening, and the acting was fantastic. Anyway, yes, this film has flaws and it's lack of fan service might be a little disappointing to a lot of power rangers fans. But I definitely cannot call this a bad one. If you're looking for a decent action film with a good amount of cheesiness, you'll probably like this film. And I would especially recommend it to aspies, if they need a cool one to relate to and look up to. I seriously think this film would be 10 stars to me if Billy was the main character. But as it is, it's fine.","6/10"
"Power Rangers","JimmyTeller","23 March 2017","Power Rangers succeeds as a film that actually cares about character building, unlike the typical Transformers movie that throws you right in the middle of numbing explosions and special effects, or getting too caught up in it's lore. It is never easy to make a character driven movie for an ensemble cast, but director Dean Israelite chose to gamble a majority of the runtime on fleshing out the characters, and it pays off. We are in turn rewarded with an effective, even if somewhat flawed storyline that warms us up to the heroes and allows us to establish an emotional connection with them, from their struggles to their triumph. And the film's climax, non-stop action backed with great music, becomes a hugely rewarding payoff.Israelite, a professed fan of the series, really does get it. He uses reliable tropes of a coming of age, underdog story, and litters the film with the right amount of nostalgia and cheesiness, in all the right places. The film is ultimately funny, nostalgic and uplifting, even if predictable. Fans of the series, watch it with your friends and go in expecting nothing. You just might be overwhelmed as I was.","6/10"

"Power Rangers","AaronDSimpson","3 July 2017","It has been a long time coming in contemporary film, but we've finally arrived at a point where directors no longer feel the need to cast baby-faced thirty-somethings as high-schoolers. Despite concerns from producers over the decades that younger actors are less experienced and might not act as well as their older counterparts, it seems that someone in Hollywood has realised that they aren't convincing us that any of them are under thirty-five. Power Rangers, however, boasts an average age of twenty four and, even then, it is only Black Ranger, Ludi Lin, throwing off the statistics at age thirty-three. If there is nothing else about this film that you could take away and tell your friends, at least you've got young-adult acting done by those that know it best.Often when films are remade and franchises are revived it can turn out badly for the original, as Clash of the Titans (2010) and Carrie (2003) can attest. Yet, in other occasions it can turn out brilliantly and revive latent passions and childhood excitement, such as with Rise of... and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2011 and 2014 respectively - ignoring, of course, Tim Burton's hash in 2001. Going into Power Rangers, knowing the thin line between failure and success and looking forward to reliving the experience of Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (1997) and Might Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie (1995), I found the reboot to be the perfect blend of cheese and modernisation. After all, it is a great strength of a remake to honour the legacy that precedes it whilst taking the franchise forward into a relevant direction.The rangers; Jason, Kimberly, Billy, Zack, and Trini meet one another during detention where each of them are revealed to be troubled and, partly, misunderstood teens. Red Ranger, Jason, has ruined his chances of a football scholarship when a prank involving the school's mascot goes wrong. Blue Ranger, Billy, is struggling with Autism after the death of his father, and the Yellow Ranger, Trini, struggles with sexuality and identity under the pressures of her normative family. The majority of the film is spent nurturing their character arcs and developing, what appears to be, an origin story for the rangers. Whilst dynamic characters are always cherished in films, it is slightly to the film's discredit that this process takes so long as action scenes are rushed into the ending almost as if Israelite were trying to fill Saban's quota of heroism. That being said, the interpersonal relationships that dominate the early parts of the film are what make it unrecognisable from a Power Rangers movie and this isn't entirely a detriment. There are no cringe-worthy martial arts, power stances, or badly sewn costumes, instead - meeting with the new requirements for superheroes - five regular kids that stumble across their powers. Whilst Billy is messing around in the gold quarry, a detonation goes wrong and the explosion reveals an alien rock from which Zack extracts the power 'coins' whilst attempting to find something valuable.After meeting Alpha-5 (Hader), a robot much like B.E.N. from Treasure Planet (2002) in both mannerism and appearance, and a digitised Zordon (Cranston) beneath the quarry in an episode of upside-down water reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), the pace of the film quickly increases. The transition from rangers who were struggling to morph and couldn't defeat the simulated soldiers in training were suddenly fully-suited and riding Zords into Angel Grove to defeat Goldar. All of the success in creating a modern and respectable Power Rangers, impervious to instant dating is slightly reduced at the appearance of Rita Repulsa (Banks), who's make-up is an insult to make-up artists everywhere. You might argue that her static character, simplistic villainy, and antiquated costume is an aspect of the original that demands a place in the remake, her character is something of an eye-sore compared to the refreshing rangers. Considering the lengths gone to humanise the rangers and, to some extent, Zordon, it is disappointing that Repulsa has been neglected in this respect. The reality is that her only saving grace is her unawareness of Krispy Kreme - a brand that appears so centrally you might wonder about their contribution to the production - which offers a cheap comic thrill throughout.The crowning moment of the film, and the final nod to the original, is during the action sequence where the rangers are racing in their Zords back to Angel Grove and the original theme tune occupies the channels. For some, this is an act of unforgivable cringe but, for me, I was privately filled with child-like wonder and an overwhelming wish that I could be a power ranger - Any of the colours would have done in that moment. Even the 'boss fight' between the Rita/Goldar hybrid and the Megazord did not compare. The process of the Zords becoming the Megazord a little too similar to Transformers, which Israelite must of realised considering the Easter egg which features Bumblebee parked in the street during the battle.The film can be considered a success for the hardcore fan-base of the Power Rangers series as it does a commendable job of modernising the franchise and making it relevant to a new audience. However, for new viewers, there are going to be moments of confusion as to whether you're watching The Avengers, or Transformers and poses the threat of being a flash-in-the-pan, definitely entertaining during the two hours you're watching it, but not something that you're going to remember the details of two weeks later.Despite institutions like Forbes reporting that a sequel is unlikely, the plot has been engineered with a follow-up in mind.

"Power Rangers","nickijjohnson","25 May 2017","Frankly I find it hilarious that this movie is getting such bad reviews. I didn't think it was any worse than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remake though I hated that remake because I loved the original so I suppose I could understand how die hard Power Ranger fans may have not liked it. I watched the show when I was little and I have to say quite frankly it was the updated version of the same crap to me. It was a little more Breakfast Club than the TV show was. In fact when I first saw the trailer I thought it was going to be a remake for The Breakfast Club. I've also read reviews with people complaining about the acting which I find even more hilarious because the acting in the TV show was so over the top overacting that I found the movie's actors to be the toned down versions. Even the over- acting of Elizabeth Banks was nothing compared to the actor who played her in the TV show. In the end when they all synced up is when it really reminded me of the show. It's unfortunate though that there's already been Transformers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because it comes off as a wannabe even though none of these movies are original. They're just regurgitated shadows of their former selves. Next up is Baywatch. Why don't they just do I Love Lucy while they're at it? Anyway entertaining enough and to me just the updated version. A more pleasant blast from the past than that Ninja Turtle or Ghostbusters crap.","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","subxerogravity","18 October 2015","This movie hit me really strangely.I was expecting a political drama about the cold war, and while indeed it was that, I was not expecting to have so much fun and for Bridge of Spies to be so humorous. The Coen brothers writing a movie Steven Spielberg would direct just sounds like a winning combination and it really was. Sealing the deal, was a great performance by Tom Hanks.Tom Hanks does what he does best, by playing an everyday man in an average life. James Donovan was just an insurance lawyer who gets caught up in the middle of the Cold War. Bridge of Spies, starts him off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure.And I do mean adventure. In the hands of Spielberg, the movie's visuals were large and epic. I was expecting this movie to feel more like his last flick, Lincoln. Instead it feels more like Indiana Jones, as James Donovan travels to Berlin at the time when the wall was being completed. Watching Hanks play Donovan who is just swept into an overwhelming situation and just keeps his cool and his charm is just highly enjoyable. Totally loved Bridge of Spies, It's one of the best team ups between Hanks and Spielberg and even though Lincoln was a great movie, Bridge of Spies is everything Spielberg is capable of. So entertaining.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","bob-the-movie-man","29 November 2015","There are combinations of film makers that make you confident, as you pay your ticket price, that you are not going to be terribly disappointed: Steven Spielberg directing; Tom Hanks taking the lead; Janusz Kaminski behind the camera; Michael Kahn editing and a Coen brothers script (with Matt Charmon (Suite Française)). And Bridge of Spies doesn't disappoint, particularly for someone of my more advanced years (I was born the year following the film's climatic events) who remembers well the terror of potential nuclear catastrophe that hung over the world through the 60's and 70's.In a story based on true events, Hanks plays James Donovan (diverging somewhat from reality here) as an insurance lawyer dragged by his firm into defending Rudolf Abel, the accused Soviet spy played exquisitely by British stage acting legend Mark Rylance. Against this backdrop, the international blue touch paper is about to be lit by the shooting down over Russia of Gary Powers (Austin Stowell from ""Whiplash"") in his U-2 spy plane (sorry – ""article""). Donovan becomes instrumental in unofficially negotiating on behalf of the US government the release of Powers in East Berlin. The deal is jeopardized by his boy-scout tendencies to also want to help another US captive Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers).I've read some negative reviews of this film in the papers that made me quite cross, describing it as ""yawnsome"" and ""sanctimoniously dull"". For me, nothing could be further from the truth and the packed Saturday night audience I saw this with seemed equally gripped from beginning to end, silent save for the odd laugh where some appropriate humor is weaved into the story.Tom Hanks is solid and believable as the fish-out-of-water lawyer, albeit that the role is played with a large spoonful of patriotic American sugar as Donovan trumpets about the importance of the constitution over the lynch-mob mentality of the general public. Alan Alda – great to see again on the big screen – channels his best Hawkeye-style exasperation as Donovan's boss, looking for a clean and quick conviction.But it is Mark Rylance – an irregular player in movies, and due to appear again in next year's ""BFG"" – who shines out as the acting star of the film. His salubrious and calm turn as the cornered spy just reeks of class and if he isn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this then there is no justice. (A special 'casting recognition award' to my wife Sue for spotting that the actress playing Judge Byer's wife – Le Clanché du Rand – was Meg Ryan's mother in Sleepless in Seattle 22 years ago!) The cinematography is superb with some gorgeous tracking shots and framed scenes. Most outstanding of all is the scene depicting the traumatic construction of the Berlin wall – long tracking shots in greys and blues delivering a truly breathtaking piece of cinema. In general I'd give a big shout-out to both the art department and the special effects team in making the desolation of East Berlin feel so real. It makes the similar scenes, that I commented positively on in the recent ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" seem like an amateur school production.The special effects team also contribute in making the shooting down of the U-2 a thrilling piece of cinema.Music is sparingly and effectively used by Thomas Newman, and it can be no greater complement to the composer than that I was wondering until the end titles as to whether it was another Spielberg/ John Williams collaboration or not.A great film, one of my favorites this year. Highly recommended, especially if you are over 50. You should also get out to a cinema to see this one – it will be far more effective on the big screen than the small one.(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

"Bridge of Spies","hoxjennifer","18 October 2015","Don't be fooled by the title. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you watch this film. Bridge of Spies is literally about the Cold War Bridge of Spies, where Soviet/US spies were exchanged through negotiations. This is nothing like ""The Americans"" (FX TV drama - for some high unrealistic and over-sexualized espionage action - redirect here) and the most action-packed scene you will see is Francis Gary Powers getting shot out of his U2 plane during his mission. Bridge of Spies is really a historical/legal drama. And based on my preliminary research, they seem to be getting most of their facts right. Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. There is a lot of talking, but it's meaningful talking. At times, the film can be a little slow {opening scene, especially}, but give it a chance and you might enjoy it. History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it. But thrill-seekers, you're better off to see the new James Bond movie instead.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","MrDHWong","28 October 2015","Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks, co-written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Steven Spielberg. Even though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I know very little about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than ever to learn more about it. I rank it among the best of Spielberg's most recent movies.In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war, Abel for Powers.Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another memorable performance as James B. Donovan, once again proving his versatility as an actor.I rate it 8.5/10.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 February 2016","Following ""War Horse"" and ""Lincoln,"" ""Bridge of Spies"" rounds out Steven Spielberg's trilogy of histories in the 2010s, each film earning a Best Picture nomination for being a superb piece of craft — and having Spielberg's name attached.None of these are bad, but they are extremely traditional films evoking the prestige dramas of the '90s and not necessarily offering anything new. As such, ""Bridge of Spies"" doesn't shed new light on Cold War history, but it does tell a small story with of inspirational characters with a lot of heart.Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, an insurance attorney asked to represent a recently detained Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A proud Constitutionalist of sorts, Donovan decides it's his honor and duty to give one of America's most hated men his right to a defense. Then, when a U.S. pilot is captured in Soviet territory, the CIA recruits Donovan to negotiate a swap. ""Bridge of Spies"" echoes ""Lincoln"" in its portrayal of a morally tenacious man who stood firm in the face of opposition. Putting an actor as likable Hanks in the role of someone as upstanding and charming as Donovan is almost unfair. The script, treated by Mark Charman and also the Coen brothers, builds clever scenes for Hanks to navigate through with total ease. The story doesn't push or challenge the veteran, but it does frame everything that's happening with the appropriate weight, enough so that we can connect with everything Donovan is going through and respect the decisions he makes and Hanks helps communicate those stakes. The Cold War was an ugly time; it might seem that what Donovan did and how he approached his responsibilities was a moral no-brainer, but it was actually quite complicated and extremely unpopular.Rylance as well is a an excellent stroke of casting genius. More known for his stage work, the veteran creates a portrait of a man so self-assured it's frightening. It's the kind of nuanced supporting role that is easy to overlook when most award-winning supporting turns are flashy scene-stealers.Spielberg and longtime director of photography Janusz Kaminski give ""Bridge of Spies"" such richness. This is a film driven by plot and acting, but the picture is pristine. In particular, the way they capture East Berlin during the negotiations scenes is feels haunting in a way few films taking place in that similar time and place have. Also, the visual symbolism of reflections and different perspectives is something Spielberg plays with subtly but enough so to put some artistic flourishes on his film. Most importantly, the climactic bridge sequence works on every level, and that alone proves Spielberg, cast and crew all did their job.When Spielberg is done directing, ""Bridge of Spies"" will probably not make anyone's list of his top films, but it shows that just about any corner of history can make for an excellent film in capable hands.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Bridge of Spies","JohnDeSando","19 October 2015","""Everyone deserves a defense. Everyone matters."" James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks)In Bridge of Spies, Steven Spielberg once again masterfully goes to the historical drama with a righteous man's theme (think Schindler and Lincoln for starters). This time lawyer James B. Donovan is asked to defend an accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Able (Mark Rylance, superb), in order to show the world the American justice system is democratic. The story is ""inspired by true events"" with the outline of the exchange of Able for U-2 downed pilot Gary Powers historically accurate. As usual, Spielberg recreates the times with the atmosphere, cars, and film noir aspect of a spy thriller in the figurative and literal Cold War. He said, ""I always wanted to tell the stories that really interested me in my personal life—which are stories about things that actually happened.""Hanks is central to Spielberg's vision of the lone hero defying the odds and supporting the highest ideals of the American Constitution and the individually virtuous man. Never does Hanks overplay the good-guy card; he's just very adept at playing an everyman not always right but always righteous. The dialogue is crisp, a no fooling around typical of Spielberg and Hanks but a charming bad guy as well: James Donovan: ""Aren't you worried?"" Rudolf Abel: ""Would it help?"" As producer Kristie Macosko Krieger commented about Spielberg, ""He's got a childlike sense of wonder. He never gets tired of hearing stories . . . . "" Bridge of Spies is vintage Spielberg with a Lincoln-like atmosphere, righteous hero, and intriguing multi-plot, an entertaining spy story brimming with humanity. As the director says, ""This is more about very smart people in conversation with each other, and the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads is that, if they make the wrong decisions, it's the end of the world.""","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Quinoa1984","8 October 2015","One of the surprising things about Bridge of Spies is not really that Steven Spielberg directed this story, which tracks the trial and then trade of a Russian spy in 1957 (an exchange for an American pilot, and someone else who I'll get to shortly). It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.It's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).The Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.In a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.Bridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice (""Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters"" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.Two little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.Aside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","8/10"

Donovan is successful and Rudolf is sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death penalty. Meanwhile the American pilot and spy Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is arrested by the Soviet government while taking photos from a spy plane that crashed. The CIA summons Donovan to help in the negotiation to exchange the two spies. When Donovan learns that the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) was arrested in the border of East Berlin while trying to bring his German girlfriend to the West Berlin, he decides to include the student in the negotiation. However his proposal is not supported by the CIA that is interested in Powers only. Further, Powers is prisoner of the soviet government and Pryor is prisoner of the GDR (German Democratic Republic). Will Donovan succeed in his intent?""Bridge of Spies"" is a great spy thriller based on a true story in the period of the Cold War. The plot is engaging and the cinematography, costume design and art direction are amazing. It is unnecessary to comment the direction of Steven Spielberg and the performance of Tom Hanks, perfect as usual, but it is impressive the capacity of negotiation of James B. Donovan. This American lawyer is shown as an impressive negotiator, having cold blood to make tough decisions. The credits informs that Donovan has been also successful negotiating later in Cuba the release of prisoners. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ponte dos Espiões"" (""Bridge of Spies"")","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","erkucz00","9 April 2016","Bridge of spies is not your typical movie, it almost seems like it would be boring, except it isn't. This film is like a tree that you drive by on your way to work. Nothing special, quite ordinary; and then one day you see it from a different angle, and the way the dew glistening off of its leaves catches the sunlight, just takes your breath away. As I mentioned before, bridge of spies is different, it doesn't have a particularly memorable score, or poetic dialogue, every character is portrayed as a ""regular guy/gal"". The credit must go to the Coen brothers here. The actors lines, particularly the exchanges between Hanks' and Rylance's characters are stirring in their simplicity. The story unfolds similarly, everything sort of just happens, and at the end, it all fits together perfectly.Nobody knows, what makes Spielberg so great, is it his groundbreaking camera work? or perhaps his implementation of cutting edge visual effects? In my humble opinion it is his enigmatic ability to take what would likely be dull and uninteresting in the hands of any other director, and turn it into a thing of wonder. This movie plays out naturally, with moments of subtle heroism, and true human emotion, it is so very downplayed, that one simply cannot pull their eyes away. Bridge of Spies is truly an Organic Wonder.","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Turfseer","3 November 2015","What motivated Steven Spielberg to go ahead and take on a project such as ""Bridge of Spies?"" I've read that it was simply his nostalgia for the Cold War era, firmly ensconced in his childhood memories. Unfortunately, the vehicle to tell that story—the combined tale of the capture and trial of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel and swap for the downed US pilot Gary Powers on Russian soil—packs little punch due to its obvious lack of suspense.The ""Bridge of Spies"" narrative can be easily summarized in a short paragraph: the US government unofficially conscripts insurance lawyer James Donovan to defend Soviet spy Abel after he's captured by the Feds in Brooklyn. The trial is a foregone conclusion but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence Abel to prison instead of death since he could be used in a prisoner exchange in the future. Sure enough, after Gary Powers is shot down in his U2 spy plane, Donovan is again called upon to negotiate a prisoner swap with the Russians. A wrench is thrown into the negotiations when a US graduate student is arrested as a spy by the East Germans. Donovan deftly negotiates the swap of Abel for both Powers and the American student, and the exchange is facilitated with little incident.As historical incidents related to the Cold War go, the Abel-Powers narrative is hardly one of high drama. A major problem is that Donovan has no single, strong antagonist to play off of. The negotiations with his Soviet counterpart, a KGB agent masquerading as a diplomat, are a forgone conclusion. We know of course that the spy swap will be successful, so where is the suspense? The ""heart-pounding"" moment is hardly heart pounding at all—as Abel and Powers are about to exchange places, there is a slight delay before the East Germans deliver the American student to complete their part of the bargain.Yes of course I understand that Donovan dramatically threatened the East Germans, as they could have been blamed by the Russians for sabotaging the spy swap. But their decision was really a forgone conclusion too, as the East Germans were always under the yoke of the Russians, and were in no position to act independently (balking at giving up the student of course was their way of ""saving face"").With all this lack of suspense, it was incumbent upon Mr. Spielberg's screenwriters (including ""luminaries"" Joel and Ethan Coen) to manufacture a series of fictional events to spice up a ""thriller"" that hardly thrills at all! Here a few examples: spectators at Abel's sentencing did not loudly object to the no death penalty sentence; Donovan and family were not victims of a drive-by shooting; Donovan's coat was not stolen by a gang in East Berlin (in reality, Donovan merely observed a gang nearby) and Donovan never personally observed people being killed as they attempted to climb over the Berlin Wall.Spielberg's attempt to recreate the era is rife with numerous gaffes. Early on Donovan is seen riding in a in a NYC R-32 subway car that first went into service in 1964 (the scene is set in 1961). That wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the interior of the car appears to be from the 70s and beyond, and not 1961. The gaffes, which include anachronisms, character error, continuity, errors in geography, factual errors, plot holes, revealing mistakes and miscellaneous errors are all detailed under the Bridge of Spies ""Goofs"" section on IMDb.""Bridge of Spies"" is not a complete loss as the film features some excellent acting by Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy Abel. With its 40 million dollar budget and decided lack of suspense, I wonder why the film was made in the first place. It of course gives Spielberg an opportunity to peddle a rather simplistic and obvious message: there were some bad people on the other side of the Iron Curtain (faceless soldiers shooting people trying to escape over the Berlin War) but also individuals such as master spy Abel, who end up displaying unexpected glimpses of humanity.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","larrys3","5 February 2016","Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance lead the way here and give superlative performances in this cerebral and powerful Cold War drama. Another masterful movie from director Steven Spielberg, with a most solid screenplay from Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel.The films all centers around the initial defense of accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) by attorney James B.Donovan (Hanks), which made Donovan a most unpopular man in America, especially when he appealed Abel's conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the conviction by a 5-4 vote.Meanwhile, in 1960, a U.S. U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers was captured by the Soviets, after his spy plane was shot down over Soviet territory. Subsequently, the American State Dept. would ask Donovan to possibly negotiate an exchange of Abel and Powers, since Donovan had been contacted by the Soviets through the East Germans that this might be possible.Based on true events, there's plenty of intrigue here as Donovan, through intense and difficult negotiations, tries to acquire the release of the two prisoners, along with a third prisoner the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), being held on ""spy"" charges by the East Germans. It will all culminate in some amazing and tense scenes on the German Glienicke Bridge.All in all, I found this to be a first class movie, that despite it's length of 2 hrs. and 21 min., had me absorbed throughout.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","blanche-2","13 February 2016","""Bridge of Spies"" from 2015 is about the Francis Gary Powers incident in the 1960s. As usual, with the exception of the Lincoln assassination, I remember it. This time, though, only vaguely.The U.S. arrested a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and chose James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who had some experience in military cases, to defend him. Abel is found guilty but Donovan is able to convince the Judge to commute his sentence to life in case the U.S. needs him later - for instance, if we should want to exchange him for one of our own.That situation happens when Francis Gary Powers, taking aerial photographs for the CIA, is shot down and taken prisoner. Donovan is then sent to negotiate the exchange.For many people, this will be a slow, talky drama, with one big action scene, Powers being shot down, and one scene of tension (if you don't know the outcome).It is, however, a very good drama with Hanks giving a strong and sometimes humorous performance as Donovan, thrust into the world of international spies and negotiations. He takes it upon himself to also work for the freedom of an American student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) who was arrested for being at the wrong place at the wrong time. That student is the only person involved in the case who is alive today, at 83, and praised the film but thought they ""took a lot of liberties with it."" Well, that's Hollywood.The main reason, other than historical interest, to watch this film is the performance of Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel. A winner of three Tony awards, two Olivier awards, and a BAFTA, Rylance is a highly regarded stage actor, known as the best of his generation. He's made very few films but he's about to make more and take the film industry by storm.As Abel, Rylance creates a human being, portraying him as a quiet, unassuming older man sent to do a job. He bonds with Donovan, but he tells him that he's not afraid to die. He spends his time in prison drawing. It is a remarkable performance which has earned him an Oscar nomination.Strangely, many people involved in this incident didn't live too long after -- Abel, who returned to the Soviet Union and to his family, lectured for 10 years and died in 1971; Donovan died in 1970; and Powers died in a helicopter crash while working for a TV station in 1977.I hope the film will encourage some people to read up on this case - of course, I always hope that. Maybe some time somebody will do it rather than posting the question someone did about Gandhi -- was this a fictional character.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","nsharath009","6 October 2015","A feel-good Cold War melodrama, Bridge of Spies is an absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous ""war"" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the ""we won"" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Michael_Elliott","13 February 2016","Bridge of Spies (2015) *** (out of 4)Attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is given the thankless job of defending suspected Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Donovan accepts the job but soon finds himself defending his client a bit too good for some, which leads to him being the main negotiator between America and Russia when it comes time for a prisoner swap.Steven Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES isn't one of the director's greatest works but it's certainly a very well-made film that manages to hold your attention throughout the rather long running time. I must admit that the trailer for the film really left me cold so I wasn't sure what to expect from the film but overall it's another good movie from the director, although the ending falls into that cringe-worthy, over-sentimental stuff that the director does quite often.With that said, there's no doubt that there's a highly good story being told here that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. The screenplay by Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman does a very good job at capturing the spirit of the period and even if you're not familiar with the Cold War the film does a nice job at bringing you up to speed on the various fears. Spielberg perfectly handles the material and milks it for some nice drama as well as some political points that are certainly meant to be taken into consideration on some current issues.Hanks, as you'd expect, turns in an excellent performance and is certainly believable in the role of the attorney who finds his life spinning out of control from not only his wife but strangers who feels he is helping a spy. Hanks is such a calm grace that it really was entertaining just seeing him negotiate. Rylance also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played this character and I really loved the laid back approach to where the character never tips his cap in regards to what and who he really is. Technically speaking the film is quite good and of high standards.BRIDGE OF SPIES could have been a bit tougher on the political aspects but it's goal was to aim for the mainstream and in the end it's an entertaining film.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","teddyryan","19 October 2015","I am biased in my review of BRIDGE OF SPIES. The Cold War is my thing, always has been my thing. I am dazzled by that time in history: surveillance, the cars, CIA, Eisenhower, and the mystique of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. From the trailer of this film, I expected a delicious plate of Cold War atmosphere, intrigue, and commentary. Like a gleeful child, I sprinted to the movie theatre – expecting a non-pretentious high octane version of Mad Men. I anticipated my favorite era in history being served up like LET ME IN (a piece of 1980s period perfection elegantly directed by Matt Reeves).I held close the trailer as I landed my perfect middle seat in the theatre. The clips of a U2 Surveillance jet spiraling at 70,000 feet, children overflowing in tears as they watch a thermonuclear film strip, and Tom Hanks' face plastered to a subway window as we see guards firing at bystanders trying to climb over the Berlin Wall. Then you add Steven Spielberg to the mix – the master of the period piece – modern cinema - the evoker of our deepest emotions. One of my favorite Spielberg films is Munich. Munich captures the violence of the Middle East 70s with revere, respect, and revelation. This is what I wanted from Bridge Of Spies. I wanted a dark, harrowing portrait of the Cold War, I wanted this tense era exposed in Spielbergian fashion, and I wanted to have 1957-1961 ruminating in my heart, mind, and belly. Bridge of Spies, however, met none of my desired expectations. Diluted by a PG-13 rating, filled with comedic moments (clearly due to the Coen Brothers having written or participated in this script) that don't tickle my fancy, and an avoidance of Cold War atmosphere – Bridge Of Spies hit me like a tennis ball on the head. It's taught, adequately plotted, and the hero is smart, likable, and witty. It's garnered rave reviews. But, for anyone that likes substance, don't look here. Spielberg's story is a moral tale – of courage and standing up for one's ideals – the universal plot which Steven devours like a hungry child. Unfortunately, there's no stakes. Hanks follows his journey and does what he does best – but his universe is given little context. You'll want turkey and you'll get turkey – but you're not getting any gravy. **Possible Spoilers – Things that bugged me about the film was plethora of wasted opportunities. When you have Spielberg at the helm, you know what could have been – 1. The relationship between the Lawyer (Hanks) and the Soviet Captive (Mark Rylance) is an unbalanced paper weight. We get a glimpse into the Lawyer's character, the archetypal Tom Hanks - fair, honest, moral, etc. We get very little info on the Captive. He is quiet, dignified, and keeps responding to Hanks wondering if he is aware of his dire situation, ""Would it help?"" Rylance is the typical Spielbergian ""caught in the middle guy"" – much like Ben Kingsley in Schindler's List. Physically weak, trapped and powerless - yet stoic and unafraid. That being said, what are his motives? He is a spy but what drives him – where is the monologue where he explains his background, what formed and shaped him and what forms the basis of his lifelong goals?2. What I love about Mad Men is its strong focus on the media and culture of the era. Except for the end of Bridge of Spies (where we get a clip of Pierre Salinger informing the news of the spy swap) and an early scene of a teenage girl watching a late night story, there's not much to nibble on – Spielberg wastes a huge opportunity in a class room scene where kids are watching a nuclear bomb film strip. Lifting the film strip like a YouTube Clip and then showing a few generic shots of kids watching it and one girl crying - the master of modern cinema stumbles and falls into shallow surf. In this instance, I wanted to yell at the editor – build this up, let it seep in, give us some Wonder Years or Let Me In flavor. There's none to be had – 3. Not only do we get a vapid Francis Gary Powers – due to lackluster character development and the miscasting (in my opinion), but the U2 Surveillance storyline is about 12 minutes. Give me at least 25, Steven!! When the U2 is shot out of the sky, we get about a minute of action – give us three. In addition, because Francis Gary Powers has no character development, I don't sympathize with him or even care if he comes home. 4. The PhD student who is included in the Prisoner Swap is devoid of character – another guy that I could care less if he makes it home. Both guys appeared to have a lackluster indifferent time over the in the USSR. The Soviets dowsed Powers with water and German soldiers rip up the PHD students thesis paper – oh no!5. There is no discussion of the disastrous political implications of the U2 being shot down over the Soviet Union. Reluctant to authorize the mission, Eisenhower was smeared by its failure and left office of the President on a black cloud. However, we don't hear Eisenhower's name mentioned once in the story. All and all, Spielberg delivers a cup of vanilla ice cream with fudge – most audiences are going to love Hanks and the Soviet spy. In the final analysis, it's a buddy film with some period costumes and a somewhat poignant conclusion. That being said, those that want a stirring pot of fear, sadness, and elation – I suggest you wait for this on HBO and watch Munich instead. Ted's Personal Enjoyment: C+","1/10"
"Bridge of Spies","tjgoalie13","18 October 2015","Bridge Of Spies is a well acted, thrilling, smart Cold War drama that features a Oscar worthy performance from Tom hanks. Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said the film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks performance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar nomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have been, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.","3/10"
"Bridge of Spies","dierregi","31 December 2015","If you expect to see much spying or bridges in this movie you will be sorely disappointed. The plot is about ace lawyer Tom Hanks (his screen name does not really matter, since the movie is just star performance) who is going to prove how good he is, both to the Russians and the East-Germans.A rather puffy-faced Hanks is in most scenes, playing a smug and arrogant lawyer, who always gets the last word and whatever he wants. His performance as a the lawyer is rather overbearing and even slightly unpleasant, but the public still liked him a lot and laughed at all his one-liners (again, star performance, rather than good plot or script).The spies or would-be spies featured in the movie are: 1) a sour little man, who speaks with what sounded to me an Irish accents and who was supposed to be funny with his unflappability. He repeats ""Would it help if I worry?"" countless times, every time getting a laugh 2) a rather dumb American pilot and 3) another sort of heroic American student, getting mixed up with foreign politics, when he'd better stayed at home. They all seem to be just props to give Hanks a chance to shine.The moral of the story should be that all countries should be better off minding their own business. However, this sound unrealistic, so the moral is that American heroes (especially Tom Hanks) always save the day. Mind the overbearing soundtrack that seems to come straight out ""Saving private Ryan""","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","PWNYCNY","22 October 2015","This movie is long, stagy, pretentious and boring. The acting is hammy, and the characters are drab and inspire little interest. The tension should have been gripping. Instead it is absent. The ending of movie is already known and is anti-climatic. The movie seems to suggest that Abel was not treated fairly and downplays the seriousness of his crimes and the sinister nature of his work. The treatment of Francis Gary Powers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker. For an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and Powers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains no heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock characters and situations usually employed to give a story some substance. Instead, the movie just plods along to its foregone conclusion. Why would any movie maker find such bland characters worthy of a movie? The real story is how the Soviets managed to shoot down an American spy plane flying at 70,000 feet. How the Soviets were able to detect and target a U2 flying at that altitude is not explained, nor is the huge political fallout caused by the Powers debacle even mentioned. Indeed, the names of Eisenhower and Khrushchev are absent, yet in the actual event they were the key players, and by leaving them out, there's no story.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","A_Different_Drummer","13 December 2015","... but not necessarily a very entertaining one.First -- and this is the key to my review --- semi-biographical films documenting real events do not have to be dull, or tedious, or dark, or lack connection with the viewer.Look at PAWN SACRIFICE, for example, recently reviewed by this reviewer and still very much top of mind.And then we have BRIDGE OF SPIES, a two-plus hour opus that one suspects never would have been greenlighted without you-know-who as the director and you-know-who playing the lead.Presumably we are meant to honor the main character's humanity as he struggles against a corrupt (or possibly insane) system to do the right thing...? If this was the intent, then even a yeoman effort from Hanks fails to make this character connect with the viewer, to resonate. In spite of it all, he comes across as a wildcard pick in a game which he never really understood.And if the events of the last few years are any indication -- this written in 2015 -- it was a game the rest of us never understood either.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","zardoz-13","26 October 2015","Historians have chronicled the events during the intervening fifty-three years in director Steven Spielberg's gripping Cold War thriller ""Bridge of Spies,"" so little comes as a complete surprise. Despite the conspicuous absence of suspense, this lavishly produced, persuasively acted, and thoroughly engrossing film remains utterly captivating. Working from a screenplay by Matt Charman, rewritten by Joel and Ethan Cohen of ""Fargo"" fame, Spielberg makes largely minor departures from the actual occurrences as they unfolded and recreates history with atmospheric spontaneity. Tom Hanks plays the congenial central character in this literate chess game of international espionage that opens with the arrest of a Soviet spy in America and culminates on a lonely Berlin bridge at dawn with rival world superpowers swapping the spy for captured U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. Spielberg doesn't squander a second in this literate narrative and shoehorns a plethora of action into 135 minutes without resorting to glamorous heroics and gratuitous pyrotechnics. Everybody always raves about the magnitude of story above all else, and ""Bridge of Spies"" exemplifies why a good, solid story—even one that has been well-documented in the international press at the time—can still yield an immensely entertaining film. Each character stands out dramatically, and each has been etched with sympathy so we are concerned about their situation. At the heart of the matter, ""Bridge of Spies"" emerges as a realistic, bona fide ""Mission Impossible"" outing when you consider all the variables that the unseen hand of fate brought to the table. What makes it doubly interesting is that only a singular incident like this could have ushered these individuals into each other's company.""Bridge of Spies"" unfolds with the FBI arresting Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance of ""Prospero's Books"") in Brooklyn during 1957. Abel had maintained a low-profile as one of the top Soviet spies in America. Masquerading as an artist, he collected sensitive information without calling attention to himself. The Soviets relied on what are known as dead letter mail boxes. Information could be stashed and retrieved, without it being apparent to most people, in innocuous places. Abel sat on a bench one day to paint a picture of a bridge. As he adjusted his easel, he felt under the bench and found a hollowed coin containing a coded message. Later, after the Feds raided his studio apartment, Abel destroyed the message under their noses while they ransacked his premises for incriminating evidence. At this point, Brooklyn insurance claims attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks of ""Forrest Gump"") enters the arena. The corporate law firm where he is a partner informs him that the New York Bar Association wants him to serve as Abel's pro-bono counsel so nobody can impugn American justice. Mind you, everybody but Donovan considers Abel's conviction a foregone conclusion. Of course, he concedes he has been chosen to defend the most hated man in America. ""Everyone will hate me,"" Donovan laments, ""but at least I'll lose."" Neither Donovan's wife, Mary (Amy Ryan of ""Capote""), nor his children share his principles. Nevertheless, Donovan goes into court swinging with everything that he has, and he discovers the deck has been stacked against him. Judge Byers (Dakin Matthews of ""Thirteen Days"") refuses to grant Donovan adequate time to prepare Abel's defense. Later, when Donovan advises Byers that the FBI had no search warrant so all the evidence should be banned, the judge ignores him. Inevitably, despite his noble efforts, Donovan cannot clear Abel. Later, Donovan visits the judge at his honor's residence and persuades the crusty old jurist to display some compassion and sentence the Soviet to prison rather than the electric chair. Byers heeds Donovan's advice despite frenzied public opinion after he delivers his verdict.In the meantime, the CIA recruits U.S.A.F. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell of ""Whiplash"") to fly a high altitude jet to conduct aerial reconnaissance over the U.S.S.R. A Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile cripples Power's plane. He bails out, but fails to obliterate his U2 plane. Of course, the Soviet capture Powers, convict him as a spy, and sentence him to prison. Not long afterward, Donovan receives a letter from the Soviets and finds himself flying to Berlin as a private citizen to negotiate a prisoner exchange: Abel for Powers. Donovan gets the royal runaround between the Soviets as well as the East Berlin authorities. Nonetheless, he proves himself to be a shrewd man with a bargain, and he pits the Soviets against East Berlin. Ultimately, he never gives ground during these complicated negotiations. The catch is he must negotiate between the superpowers as a private individual rather than an official American envoy. Read Donovan's insightful memoir ""Strangers on the Bridge,"" and you'll acquire a new appreciation for this crafty attorney.Hanks brings a jovial, 'aw shucks' Jimmy Stewart charm to his portrayal of Donovan. Literally, ""Bridge of Spies"" could be seen as ""Mr. Smith Goes to Berlin."" Hanks looks like a paunchy, unassuming figure without a clue, but he emerges as the sharpest tack in the box. Donovan's history is pretty amazing when you think about what he accomplished. Meantime, Mark Rylance distinguishes himself as Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and he overshadows Hanks with a 'less is more' performance. Repeatedly, Donovan makes comments about Abel's apparent lack of anxiety. Facing certain death, the imperturbable Abel refuses to let the pressure affect him. ""Would it help?"" he queries Donovan to worry about his fate. Austin Stowell reminded me of cub reporter Jimmy Olsen from the 1950s' ""Superman"" TV show. He embodies the wholesome, clean-cut, but ambitious American who refuses to commit suicide and struggles to make the best of a dreadful predicament.Spielberg does an exceptional job of condensing and cross-cutting these events. Budgeted at $40 million, ""Bridge of Spies"" looks authentic with its multiple locations in American and Europe. Indisputably, ""Bridge of Spies"" couldn't have been produced during the Cold War because objectivity would have been harshly compromised. Spielberg's historical reenactment is relevant because contemporary American democracy faces similar challenges.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","ThomasDrufke","18 October 2015","I don't know what it is about 2015, but I think this year has been full of films that don't entirely meet your expectations. I don't necessarily mean that those films are bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems like film after film end up making me feel a bit letdown. Bridge of Spies is the new Steven Spielberg directed film based on true events during the cold war. It focuses on James B. Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is thrust into representing a supposed Soviet spy in court and Donovan's further involvement in executing an exchange of prisoners with Russia.Much like Crimson Peak, this film is not really what the trailers make it out to be. The trailers heavily focused on the relationship between Donovan and his client, Rudolf Abel. The film gives us maybe 20 minutes between them in the beginning, but really that's all. To me, their relationship and the scenes between Hanks and Mark Rylance, who plays Abel, are easily the best the film has to offer. Even though it's never truly clear as to why Donovan backs this man so much and his motivations behind continuing the negotiations, I really bought into their dynamic. In fact, it's the only true payoff you get in the end is their relationship and its outcome.By no means is Bridge of Spies a bad film, it's not. It doesn't help that it's directed by perhaps the greatest director of all time, in Steven Spielberg. Expectations are sometimes far too high for his films. But I think the problem here is that there's just not a ton of meat to this story and it's one of Spielberg's weaker films in recent memory, but really he doesn't make any bad films. Some things did bother me about his directing here though. For example, there is a character introduced within the first 10 minutes as Donovan's associate and partner. He attends Donovan's family dinner and seems to be set up as help to Donovan and a slight possible romance is hinted at with this character and Donovan's daughter. Well, after one scene we don't see this character ever again.Amy Ryan plays Donovan's wife, who I absolutely adore as an actress, is also incredibly underused. I guess what I'm trying to get across here is that there is no flow to the movie. Or rather, no arc. It's very predictable, being a true story, but the tension isn't there either. It's a slow moving picture with a great climax but not a ton of build to get to that great climax. Surprisingly, this could be contributed to Spielberg. Spielberg does do a great job of taking us to the time of the Cold War. He certainly gives us the feeling that at any moment war could have been truly started by either side. The performances are all really good. Mark Rylance who plays Abel does a magnificent job in his limited screen-time and rightfully never gives one way or another in terms of his innocence. Tom Hanks is, well, Tom Hanks. And Thomas Newman replaces John Williams as the composer and does a wonderful job as he always does. There's a lot to really like about Bridge of Spies, more than not. But for me, it was just a bit of a letdown in its lack of intensity and pay off. I wouldn't have known it was the Coen Bros script and Spielberg's directing if it wasn't for the trailers and marketing.+Rylance & Hanks together+Spielberg transports you to the Cold War+Newman's score+Climax-Lack of intensity-Didn't get enough of Donovan and Abel together7.0/10","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Instant_Palmer","2 July 2023","Good guys DO sometimes win... We would like to believe this is true all the time. In the story presented so ably by Spielberg and the Cohen Brothers, and as acted in the Lead by Tom Hanks in this film, we can feel good that Right has might, and good guys can and DO win.2015 was an amazing year in American cinema - three of the finest films since 2000, 'A Bridge Of Spies', 'Spotlight', and 'Sicario' were released in the same year. Spotlight deserved its position as Best Film of the Year. But Bridge of Spies presented close competition - In terms of the ""feel good"" aspect, if there were an award for such, Bridge wins. The brilliant, gritty, and moody Sicario might be the best-ever film depicting the War on Drugs on and over our Southern border.With parameters of Academy Awards now ""conditional"" upon social justice messaging in 2023, a year like 2015 may be one of the last in the foreseeable future, where films shall be judged solely upon its art excellence by the Academy, something I didn't think ever necessary, as the freedom of speech and free choice has always been innately present in film art - does it really need oversight? Kind of defeats the ideals inherent in art imo.Regardless, Bridge is fabulous, one of Spielberg's best films, Hanks knocking it over the Berlin Wall and spellbinding acting by Mark Rylance who deserved his Supporting Actor statuette.HIGHLY recommended viewing!👍👍","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","TheLittleSongbird","28 April 2016","'Bridge of Spies' had much going for it, mainly that it's based on a very interesting story, Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance are talented actors with some very noteworthy performances and when in his prime Steven Spielberg directed some of the most relentlessly entertaining and entertaining films in cinema.While 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of Spielberg's finest films, in the way 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'ET', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Empire of the Sun', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Jurassic Park' are, for me despite its flaws along with 'Lincoln' and 'War Horse' (remember liking 'Munich' a lot too, though it needs a re-watch) it's one of his better ones since 'AI'.There is not an awful lot wrong with 'Bridge of Spies', though due to the subject matter it's not going to appeal to all tastebuds. To me, it's biggest problem was pacing. By all means not a continuous problem, because there was enough in the film that was really engaging, but parts do drag and not every scene felt like it was needed. The beginning is notably draggy and the film could easily have ended after the climactic scene on the bridge, because the ending did feel unnecessarily stretched and was particularly guilty of the sappiness and over-sentimentality that Spielberg is often criticised for. Similarly Donovan's family scenes could have been excised with no problem, they add very little and their cloying nature did feel too much and misplaced within the rest of the film. The only other problem was Thomas Newman's score, it's nicely composed and it fits at least (to have it used sparingly was also a good move in order to not distract from the atmosphere and dialogue) but there is nothing hugely memorable or anything to go wow over or that evokes any strong emotions. Not bad as such, just bland.However, 'Bridge of Spies', as always with Spielberg is incredibly well-made, as well as directed with a lot of class. It is sumptuously shot and the period detail is elegant, atmospheric and positively eye catching, especially the scenes in Berlin where you actually feel the cold, austerity and tension. While there is a lot of talk in 'Bridge of Spies', the script is thought-provoking and tightly structured, not making the mistake of being rambling, using complicated jargon or being too wordy. There is even some nice knowing witty humour that gives the film some freshness and is well-incorporated when it appears, while the political and patriotic elements avoid being preachy. While the pace is not completely secure and not every scene felt necessary, the story is very absorbing and is told with intelligence, tension and emotion. While there is perhaps not enough on the trial, that part is very intriguingly done, while the Berlin scenes that dominate the film have a lot of tension and suspense. The shift from America to Berlin is handled well and not too crudely, a very easy thing to do when visually and atmospherically their scenes are so different.The characters are engagingly written on the most part, with the exception of Donovan's family (his wife in particular is the typical nurturing but frustrated cliché with little variation on it). Donovan is one of those characters that holds the narrative together as strong as a rock and is easily rootable, while Abel comes close to being the most sympathetic character while at the same time evoking some chills. The chemistry between the two characters is very strongly done. All the acting is very good (though Amy Ryan barely registers in the role that gives her very little to work with), with Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance being outstanding. Hanks is effortlessly commanding and has such a great cool charisma, essential for a lead role that is on screen for almost the whole duration. Despite his screen time being much less, Rylance portrays Abel with quiet understated dignity, with his expressions and eyes speaking every bit as much as when he's delivering his lines, that comes over both chillingly and heart-wrenchingly.All in all, excellent and often very absorbing. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox","7/10"

"Bridge of Spies","drqshadow-reviews","1 February 2016","Hanks and Spielberg tackle a Cold War spy-exchange against the backdrop of a freshly-constructed Berlin Wall. As one might expect from these old masters, it's expertly-crafted and loaded with gravitas; a warm, motivated take on a surprisingly under-explored chapter of recent history. It does a great job of delicately re-evaluating popular sentiment and the bullish nature of post-war international relations, too, painting heroes and victims on both sides of the dispute. The plot is very linear, though, moving on a predictable set of rails from start to finish, and that can make it feel preachy when a few of the more heavy-handed themes briefly overstay their welcome. A foundationally-strong, workmanlike offering, it's 50% desperately-uphill legal drama and 50% high stakes poker with a set of captive American souls as the ante.","4/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Rogermex","18 October 2015","Spielberg knows what he did, but I have a few thoughts. Let's start with the title - You know, there's only one ""spy"" per se, who matters anyway. But it makes it sound like some thriller-diller, eh?Now Tom Hanks - uh, what's with that incredibly furrowed, knit brow all through the story. Makeup Oscar time? Did they borrow it from a Klingon?The woman who plays Donovan's wife? I know she's supposed to be convincingly all 1950s square - but really, heels and full lipstick all the time? Smiling at everything? At least they didn't plug in Jessica Chastain, that would not have been credible opposite Donovan's shlubby character. A performance as flat as one of those pancakes in the big American breakfast he never ate.The youth are not at this movie, they're all out to see the latest vampire/zombie/Tom Cruise dreck. So the boomers out to see an ennobling patriotic drama have lived through all this, including ""duck and cover"" and the Missile Crisis. Do those of us who actually were terrorized and traumatized by all that really need pedantic little lessons about the bombs and the sirens, delivered by Donovan's delusional little genius son? I found it insulting.Of course, all the Russians are scene-chewing geeky monsters, sometimes in such close-up we can see the beet-bits in their teeth.Gosh, it was cold in that Cold War! So we have to see everyone blowing and wiping their noses, boogers hanging, in order to get the idea?Exception: Mark Rylance, the only great thing about the movie. I've been watching Rylance in ""Wolf Hall,"" and it's very impressive how he can create such a level of charismatic tension by hardly doing anything at all. He's all stillness, posture, little eye movements and gazes, all restrained, all coiled in. Amazing.Back to the thriller at hand. So in the big spectacle scene where the U2 gets shot down, did Spielberg really need to show off, proving ""Oh, I can do 'Gravity,' I can do 'The Walk'"" just for bragging cred? And is it actually historically true that Powers gripped on to edge of his crumbling cockpit and just failed to hit the destruct button before his tether broke? (OH! is that a sneaky symbolic allusion to 'aborting' a mission?)This whole thing could have been done as a 15-minute documentary (not that I'd like seeing another documentary) rather than puffed up into a dry and predictable ""drama. When we see Hanks' character lying face down on his bed at home because he's so beat, I suppose if I were him I'd be concerned to hide my face for having accepted another such stereotypical heroic individual little man role.Do nasty CIA agents really skip into the air in peevish excitement like an 11-year old when they get frustrated? (Oh, they probably do.)It might have been more exciting to get into a row with the dopey woman in the seats behind us who kept aggravating my wife by kneeing and bumping the back of her seat - but ""Would it help?""So the Coen brothers helped write this. I guess Spielberg thought it might be more tasty to shmear some funky mustard on this baloney sandwich, but ""Would it help?"" My fantasy is that the Coens were often snickering up their sleeves.","4/10"
"Bridge of Spies","AlienByChoice","22 October 2015","Hanks, Alda, Spielberg, the Coen brothers. What can go wrong? Apparently, quite a lot.Strengths first: the meticulous recreation of the 60's across two countries is breathtaking. The streets look 60's, the people look and talk 60's, the atmosphere is 60's. It's immersing and awe-inspiring.Now the weaknesses: 1) Lots and lots of exposition. I understand that the millenials are expected to not know the history from 50 years ago, but come on - if someone doesn't know/love history they aren't going to see this movie in the first place. Stop wasting our time with exposition. 2) Poor acting. This must be the weakest performance from Tom Hanks I've seen in years. The guy is sleep-walking through the role, and everyone else is wooden and not worth mentioning, except for Alan Alda who steals every scene he's in. Amy Ryan is just awful I'm sorry to say. 3) Too long. Way too long. Should've ended with the exchange taking place. We don't need the ""happy end"" through vindication - it's completely implausible too. 4) Not focused. The pilot's story is completely surplus to requirements and insignificant - it doesn't add anything to the narrative. We don't really need to see the pilot until his first scene in captivity. Instead, the time should be spent on character development of which there is absolutely none. 5) Predictable. Yes, the story is well known and we all know how it ends, but this means that the unpredictability needs to be in the nuances. The little things that aren't part of the written history. But everything is predictable, nothing is captivating. 6) The treatment of the story. The script is by the Coen brothers but it has John Le Carre written all over it. It's a classic Le Carre-like spy thriller (thriller, not action). There have been fantastic film adaptations of Le Carre, so we know it can be done. Sadly, on this occasion Spielberg fails to deliver.4/10","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","barev-85094","8 December 2015","BRIDGE of SPIES, Spielberg // Starring Tom Hanks in Lukewarm Coldwar drama.Summary: Uninspired Spielberg Mountain from Molehill with pitiful Hanks in Pain throughout. Viewed at Colisée cinema, Marrakesh, Friday Dec. 4, 2015. By Alex Deleon. With so many intriguing Cold War subjects up for grabs one wonders what made Steven Spielberg choose this relatively minor Cold War incident as the subject matter of his latest directorial effort. The background: In the summer of 1960 an American high altitude spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union and pilot Gary Powers who bailed out and survived was interned by the Russians. At about the same time a big time Russian spy with US citizenship was arrested and put on trail for treason in the USA. Idealistic New York attorney James Donovan (Hanks) defends him in court and is then recruited by the CIA to facilitate an exchange of this spy for captured U2 spy plane pilot Powers in Berlin. The exchange took place in divided Berlin on Feb. 20, 1962 at the height of the Kennedy administration six months prior to the Cuban Missiles crisis. The foreground: The result: a big disappointment with a heavy handed script by the Coen Brothers and some very bad acting in a long tedious dragged out attempt to elevate this subject to the level of Greek tragedy with Tom Hanks pulling slightly different variations of a pained face in every scene he's in, which is most of the picture. Greek tragedy this is not, although we are compelled to feel a little sorry for Hanks when his steadfast defense of the American Constitution is met with hate, derision, and even death threats from his fellow Americans, and then he has to hide his dangerous spy exchange trip from his own family when he volunteers to go to Berlin on a thankless top secret mission to ease cold war tensions and save an American college student stranded in East Berlin into the bargain. En somme:to sum up --From The combination Spielberg/Hanks and the setting in Berlin, a city I know so well, I expected much more. This turned out to be a routine, almost soppy Hanks performance and a very routine uninspired turn by Spielberg at the helm. First of all I remember the era of the film very well and it did not seem to me at the time to be nearly the momentous event it is built up to be in this film. If lawyer Donavan (Hanks) was in the news for a while it certainly wasn't a very big while, and the spy exchange at the bridge was merely seen as a minor event in much more momentous cold war Events of the time such as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1962 and The Cuban missile crisis in October 1962. I remember thinking at the time that it was nice for our side to admit for once that We also Spy and thought that might be the ball Spielberg would run with. But the mawky family drama we are given, and the overall talkiness with little backup action, plus the building up of the the exchange on the Berlin bridge in freezing winter weather to an event of Superbowl proportions simply does not have the drama we are supposed to think it had. Overall, a dud that fails to go off in a stagy unrecognizable Berlin. Recommended only for die-hard Tom Hankniks who sympathize with Mr. next-door America, no matter what he does. As for the Cold War political background -- Google tells it much better. (Google, Gary Powers, U2 incident) Alex, Marrakesh.:","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","DKosty123","20 February 2016","There are theories that the Francis Gary Powers shoot down by USSR had something to do with JFK's eventual death. This movie stays away from that and instead the focus is on how the US made a deal to get Powers back. Based on a true story this movie tries to recreate the drama behind all these events.It does so without sinking to the depths of action sequences which director Spielberg often directs. He is proving to be a capable drama director as Lincoln proved that just a short time ago. Somehow he brought the Coen's in to write this drama along with Matt Charman. The result is a quite functional drama replete with the feeling of the cold war.The history lesson here is of value and this film is done totally from the US perspective. This makes sense as the other side was not consulted on this one. The film might even be a little too careful on how it is presented. Tom Hanks is always good though in this film there is not a lot of character development other than Hanks and the Russian Spy (Mark Rylance) Rudolph Abel who is excellent. Hanks wife gets little bits of stuff but not much and even Hank's assistant Doug - Billy Magnussen gets but one or two scenes. This film is a 2 figure drama, and the main draw back is while they explain how great this accomplishment was, there is very little of why the reasons the negotiations were so successful. This is a timely reminder about a Cold War which is now often forgotten, now that there are hot wars going in several countries today.This is when diplomacy was practiced and refined so as to achieve positive results. It is solid and well done.","1/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Laakbaar","17 February 2016","This is the story of James Donovan, who during the Cold War became a sort of secret negotiator for the American government in the trade off of Russian spy Rudolph Abel and American pilot Gary Powers.The portrayal of America during the Cold War is absolutely wonderful.Hanks's performance is excellent, as one has come to expect from the man. He is utterly believable, despite his fame.It helped that much of the movie takes place in Berlin, a city I love. Spielberg does a terrific job in showing Cold War Berlin and particularly the horror of the city getting divided.Don't believe those who are saying that the movie is too jingoistic. It's not. Spielberg and Coen don't avoid controversial issues. The movie-goer is jarred with a few thought-provoking comparisons and some gentle reminders of the difficulties of life and hypocrisies of that era. Much of the movie deals with the legal issues involved. Donovan, originally an insurance litigator, is the lawyer for the Russian spy.I have to give this movie 9/10 because I can't think of a single thing wrong with it. (OK, there is one thing: I can't say the movie really moved me that much.) This is movie-making at its best. Look at who is involved: Spielberg, Hanks, the Coen brothers, and so on. Don't miss this one.","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Prolecenter","13 August 2016","A new film set in the Cold War era of the 1950's was released a few weeks ago and is apparently a big hit. The plot revolves around James B. Donovan, a simple lawyer who is chosen to defend Colonel Rudolf Abel, a captured Soviet spy, in the midst of an atmosphere of anti-communist hysteria sweeping the US. Later in the movie Mr. Donovan is recruited by CIA to negotiate the release of captured American spies in exchange for Colonel Abel, including U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers who was captured by the Soviets after his spy plane was shot down in Soviet airspace. The tortured tagline of the film sums up the propaganda point to be driven home: ""In the shadow of war, one man showed the world what we stand for."" What we (the US) stand for is supposedly a just and humane society where everyone, even a communist spy, is entitled to a fair trial. This is set against the supposed tyranny and cruelty of communist states.However, the version of events presented in this film and the case it attempts to make in favor of an American system of ""fair play"" can easily be disproved. Many relevant details have been distorted or conveniently left out of the narrative. Also, some facts have been included but presented out of any historical context. Unfortunately, most Americans will passively accept this false narrative without question or without doing any further study of their own. They will accept the movie as being a true recounting of historical events. I could now spend a lot of time discussing every single propaganda element within the film such as the dark and gloomy atmosphere in East Berlin; the scowling faces of the East German border guards; the menacing and hostile demeanor of various communist officials or scenes of torture, but I have decided to take a different approach. I will simply tell the truth of the historical incident that this film is supposedly based on; and I will do it using the memoirs of the two primary American participants in these events - James Donovan and Francis Powers.Let's start by comparing the details and outcomes of the Abel trial in the US with that of Powers' trial in the Soviet Union. Both spies were caught red-handed and so there could be no doubt as to their guilt in both cases. Therefore, the purpose of the trials should have been simply to gather all the facts available in an effort to come up with a suitable punishment to fit the crime. Below, I have included a table that shows the results of each trial.Powers (Soviet trial) Abel (US trial) Held Incommunicado 4 weeks 3 weeks Phys. or Psych. Abuse No Yes Max. Poss. Sentence Death (rare cases) Death (very common) Actual Sentence 10 years 30 yearsPowers stated in his autobiography, written a decade after his return to the US, that he did not suffer any abuse during his captivity in the Soviet Union. Abel, however, said that during his interrogation he was struck in the face by one of the FBI agents who grew frustrated at his silence and refusal to cooperate.Powers was told by the Soviets that execution for espionage was rare in the USSR, but Abel was informed that the death penalty was very likely to be his fate. In fact, just a few years prior to Abel's trial in 1957, the Rosenbergs had been sent to the electric chair for stealing atomic secrets for the Soviet Union. Finally, in the sentences that were eventually handed down, Powers received a relatively light 10 years imprisonment while Abel was given 30 years.The Soviets were accused of subjecting Powers to a ""show trial,"" but this is exactly what the Americans did with Rudolf Abel. As it turns out, despite all the blather about the high ideals of the American legal system, Donovan and his co-conspirators were really just concerned with promoting the idea of superior values of American ""fair play,"" without any regard for the substance behind such claims. Furthermore, the real reason Mr. Donovan argued to save Abel's life was in order to hold him as a bargaining chip in the inevitable event of a spy swap with the Soviets down the road.Mr. Donovan, the humble lawyer, was actually a high-ranking career spy. He admits in his memoirs that at the time he was supposed to be impartially defending Colonel Abel, he was at that moment still a spook! In his own words he reveals that he ""still held a commission as a commander in Naval Intelligence."" Prior to that he had worked as head legal counsel in the OSS (precursor to the CIA) for several years and had helped to organize the CIA after WWII! However, from the insane viewpoint of American exceptionalism nothing here is out of place, but if this film had been done from the Soviet perspective (taking into account the undeniable facts of the incident), the plot might go like this:The US violates Soviet airspace repeatedly until one of their spy planes is finally shot down. The pilot, despite his refusal to denounce the criminal activity of his government, receives a very light sentence in comparison to America's treatment of captured Soviet agents. Some time later, a CIA spymaster shows up in East Berlin demanding the release of three American spies in exchange for one Soviet spy. Although this naturally strikes the Soviets as unfair, due to their good nature they agree. Colonel Abel returns home to a hero's welcome while Francis Powers is received with suspicion, denounced by the media and much of the American public as a traitor, and is held incommunicado by the CIA for ""debriefing"" for nearly a month.

These nominations, year after year, are making me sadder. They consistently snub GREAT films for mediocre homages. Was this a great film? Hell no. Was it very good? Nope.

"Bridge of Spies","moviexclusive","15 October 2015","Steven Spielberg's latest Cold War-era thriller begins with a near- wordless cat-and-mouse overture that reminds us how much of a craftsman he is. In that brilliant opening, we watch transfixed as FBI agents trail a suspected Soviet agent named Rudolf Abel through subways, sidewalks and parks of Brooklyn before finally raiding his apartment and arresting him on charges of treason and espionage. As much as you'd expect Spielberg to follow that up with screw- tightening suspense, he confounds that expectation just as quickly with a droll introduction to his lead protagonist named James Donovan, a New York insurance claims attorney arguing why the accident in which the client he is currently representing had hit a car with five people should not be referred to as ""five things"" but just ""one thing"".Sure enough, Spielberg doesn't try to do a Tom Clancy with this real-life story of how Donovan came to be appointed by the Bar to represent Abel and subsequently negotiated a tricky exchange of Soviet and American spies; instead, working with a brilliantly written script by Joel and Ethan Coen with Matt Charman that adapts freely from the historical record, Spielberg mounts a handsomely old-fashioned story of righteous underdog triumph. It is a feel-good drama in every sense of the word, one that not only celebrates Donovan's achievements but also honours the man for the principles of the U.S. Constitution for which he stood resolutely for, no matter how much others had already made up their mind about how the so-called American enemy should be treated.Unfolding in two quite distinct halves, the first sees Donovan giving Abel a stout defence despite the CIA's interference and presenting a compelling argument to the judge why his client should not be put to death, while setting up the circumstances by which Donovan will in fact be proved right. At what seems narratively the same time as the trial itself, the U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), selected as part of an elite group to take part in a top-secret mission to take highly detailed photographs of military installations within the Soviet Union, is captured by the Russians after his plane is shot down. It is not long after that the Berlin wall will be erected, which an American economics student named Richard Pryor (Will Rogers) finds himself on the wrong side of and detained by the East Germans.And so, in the second half, Donovan is recruited by the CIA to cut a deal with the Soviets that will see the former trade Abel for Powers' return – though Donovan decides on his own initiative to get two American men back for one Soviet spy. In contrast to the preceding half, this one is pretty much anchored through and through by Tom Hanks' Donovan, who makes multiple trips by himself across the Berlin Wall to negotiate separate deals with a top KGB agent on the return of Powers as well as a very Western East German lawyer named Vogel (Sebastian Koch) on Pryor's return. Donovan plays it cool in front of both the Soviets and the East Germans (what other choice does he have, really), but a scene where he is played by Vogel to be detained overnight by the East German police and another in which he watches East German refugees attempting to scale the wall being gunned down reinforces the peril within his lone-man mission as well as the complex geopolitical realities at play.There is no secret whether Donovan manages to navigate the potentially treacherous waters (pun intended) to secure both Powers' and Pryor's releases – yes, the history books will already have you know that it all culminates at the Glienicke Bridge linking West Berlin with Potsdam, from which the movie takes its name. Rather than playing up the facts of the case, Spielberg opts instead to focus on the unlikely American hero with the modesty, high principles and simple fairness who would – as a post-script informs – be called upon to play yet another instrumental role in the subsequent negotiation with Fidel Castro for the 'Bay of Pigs' invasion. Yet Spielberg doesn't over-emphasise these ideals to make Donovan any sort of an icon; rather, Donovan just does the right thing from moment to moment, with an uncanny ability of ""feeling"" the person at the other end of the negotiation.It is the sort of role that is perfectly suited for Hanks' Everyman charm, and the actor, here in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, gets it down pat. Removing any hint of sanctimoniousness, Hanks puts on, on top of a warm and generous performance, an extra air of humanity to play the rookie who, though way out of his depth in the rough and murky waters of espionage, follows a clear conscience and abiding values to emerge as an admirable hero. Hanks makes it all seem so natural, but lest we take it for granted, it does require a formidable actor to play the ordinary Capra-esque hero with a dry humour and much intellect to bear. And at least for a good third of the film, Hanks is well-matched with veteran stage actor Rylance, whose understated performance as Abel is a masterclass in itself.Indeed, there is never any doubt at any point in the film that we are amongst seasoned pros – besides Hanks and Spielberg, the latter's long-time collaborator Janusz Kaminski on camera who achieves a thick and luxurious atmosphere with his choice of shots and colour palette. This is as assured and confident Hollywood filmmaking as it gets, whether as a gripping fact-based docudrama or as a detailed character study or even as a sober lesson on tradecraft, political ideals and personal values. It is also Spielberg's best film in years, one that should and would see some deserved Oscar attention come next year.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Umar Mansoor Bajwa","24 February 2016","After a long time, I was able to see and witness a captivating prisoner swap drama sequel from the declassified archives of American CIA. Steven Spielberg is all praise for his professionally meticulous direction, perfectly taking the audience to the austere world of late 50s, when the Cold War was taking its surreptitious twists and turns. All the set frames including location shooting in Germany and USA were too close to reality. The entire story, script, screenplay and dialogs were so well fed and uttered with skillful craftiness by Hanks and the soviet convict spy played by Rylance, which made viable sense and were bred with the thrill that ensures the viewer to stick to the end. It is a must see spy thriller for mature audience taking them back in time to all those moments of glory unfold from enigmatic and suggestively nerve raking espionage taking place in the classic world of late 50s. Well done Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance for superb characterization of their respective roles, skillful film editing by Michael Kahn and top of the line direction by the old timer - Steven Spielberg.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","quincytheodore","26 October 2015","Capturing the weight and gloom of an era, Bridge of Spies is equally a biopic and an unexpected light drama. There's a lingering intensity, especially concerning the world of secrecy, yet it's a fascinatingly accessible story with subtle refined humor. This is meant to inspire instead of evaluation of ideologies, showcasing that humanity still resides beyond the other side of border or wall.Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is an alleged Soviet spy, he's caught and set for a trial. For his defense James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is unceremoniously selected, mainly for the purpose of procedure. After a while Donovan becomes invested on defending his client despite the unusual circumstance, it then takes him on a journey to help CIA save their own agent.Despite the rather shady title, this is not the flamboyant gunslinger action ala James Bond or the intense operation like Argo. It is, strangely and also effectively, a light foray into the otherwise dark world of espionage. The pace is utterly calm, credit goes to Mark Rylance as Abel, who occasionally shows the pettiness of worrying.He and Tom Hanks have incredible chemistry, both of the characters practically have nothing in common aside from the mutual respect towards each other. Donovan himself is avid negotiator, he pushes his objective with verbal aggression, yet the movie almost never resorts to violence and even on few occasions that it does venture to bleak territory, it does so with sophistication.Rather than using typical war buildup, the movie gives faces to each party, thus humanizing them in incredibly identifiable way. It also deals with the issues of the era head-on while maintaining composure and suspending judgment. Lastly, it offers a soft touch of comedy along the way. The unexpected banters lighten the mood with timely cynical quip, it doesn't undermine the theme and still gives polished interaction between the supposed stoic personalities.Bridge of Spies is perhaps one of the most accessible depictions of a war. It might set in Cold War and showcase the grim reality of it, yet it never falters on presenting honor, duty and the best side of humanity in less than favorable time.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","classicalsteve","22 November 2015","For over a half-century after the Second World War, from circa 1945 to 1990, the United States was involved in a ""war"" of sorts with the USSR we call the ""Cold War"". Barring the USSR's military engagements, such as in Afghanistan and other border countries, few died on other side as a result of this Cold War (and spy thriller novelists made a fortune). The Cold War was a continual chess match of adversarial confrontation and tension between the two world super-powers and their respective allies, notably the USSR and their eastern bloc allies of the Warsaw Pact and the United States and their NATO Allies of the North Atlantic Treaty. Non-violent conflicts were nearly never-ending, their chess pieces involving spies, intelligence, and espionage, each side trying desperately to gain the upper hand over their respective adversary, constantly moving their pieces to different areas of the board. When the two sides came to secret negotiating tables, they engaged the game like poker players, holding their cards close to their chests, neither side revealing any more about their hands than absolutely necessary. ""Bridge of Spies"" written by the Cohen Brothers with Matt Charman and directed by Steven Spielberg, chronicles one such as ""game"".Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a.k.a. Vilyam ""Willie"" Genrikhovich Fisher, was an older unassuming man in a small Brooklyn apartment appearing to engage in painting projects. While under the guise of a painter, Abel was passing military secrets to Soviet agents. His cover was blown in 1957 when CIA agents raided his apartment and arrested him on charges of espionage and spying for the USSR. The US government appeals to Abel for help in their intelligence gathering in exchange for his release, but Abel declines.James Donovan (Tom Hanks), a former Nuremberg Trial associate prosecutor, is working as an insurance-claim lawyer in a New York firm. His firm asks him to defend Abel as a publicity gesture to prove the US engages in fair trails, even for those who are charged with the highest-level crimes against the United States. (The film makes it seem like he was an associate attorney forced by his firm to take the case, although at the time, Donovan was in fact a senior partner of his firm Watters and Donovan.) Donovan reluctant agrees to take the case.The respective lawyers, prosecutor and defender, meet with the trail judge who explains the trail is only for ""show"" to publicly send a message to the USSR and the world at large that the US Justice Department treats all defendants fairly and impartially, even with those accused of the most heinous of crimes against the state. However, behind closed doors, the judge indicates the verdict is a foregone conclusion. Donovan, who desires to be true to his case and his client disagrees, stating the trial should be taken seriously and not act only as a kind of international publicity stunt. Donovan then meets with his client where a mutual understanding is exchanged in which Abel makes clear he has no intention of cooperating with US intelligence authorities. At first Donovan is perturbed at his client's reluctance to aid the CIA as it could mean the death penalty for Abel. However, as their attorney-client relationship evolves, Donovan begins to have respect for Abel. Abel was engaging in activities which other men in service to the United States are doing to the other side. In a profound statement, Abel says to Donovan that he hopes an American spy caught on the other side will also not be mistreated. In the only part of the film which was a bit weak, details of the actual trial are glossed over before Abel's inevitable conviction. In a surprising turn, the judge does not give Abel the death penalty but rather sentences him to a long prison term.In a different storyline, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is a US fighter pilot recruited by the CIA to engage in intelligence gathering. Scenes between the Abel case and Powers interweave and we learn about the recruitment and training process for pilots who have been drafted into the Cold War conflict. They are now expendable chess pieces in the larger game. They learn about their equipment and their undercover tasks which is so secret they are forbidden even to tell All-Mighty God about their endeavors. At first, Powers' story seems to have little to do with the Abel case, except Powers and Abel are both intelligence-gatherers for the different sides of the Cold War. However, as events play out, the two men's destinies will become intertwined. Eventually, Donovan will be traveling to Berlin where he'll see first-hand the creation of the infamous Berlin Wall.An absolutely riveting and edge-of-your seat Cold War story. While there are no car chases and no gun-fire exchanges, the story is as compelling and suspenseful as any by Spielberg and the Cohen brothers. They are masters of the well-paced scene in which we the audience are never sure how the events will resolve. Even during the final climactic event of the film, which is largely understated, not much actually happens, but our anticipation of what might and might not occur keeps us glued to every gesture and expression. This is one of the best directorial offerings by Spielberg since ""Lincoln"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the most riveting by the Cohen Brothers since ""No Country for Old Men"". Not to be missed, but it should be noted if you're looking for an action and suspense film similar to a Bond or Le Carre offering, ""Bridge of Spies"" is not that kind of story.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","nogodnomasters","28 April 2018","The film claims to be inspired by true events, which means dialogue and details may have been altered for our enjoyment and to convey a message. The story centers around insurance attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) who was requested to defend an accused Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in a US kangaroo court at great risk to his own personal safety and that of his family. I will avoid the plot spoiler details, but we know historically he would go on to negotiate the spy exchange for downed pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell).As a history buff I found the details (even if they may have been inaccurate) interesting as they weaved a tale demonstrating the ability of an insurance lawyer to negotiate.

"Bridge of Spies","grantss","3 March 2016","Interesting but clumsy and a tad idealistic.A European man living in the US, Rudolph Abel, is arrested as a Russian spy. An American lawyer, James Donovan, takes on his case but, faced with overwhelming evidence and a biased judge, loses the case. Abel is sentenced to 30 years in jail and Donovan's Supreme Court appeal fails. Just then Francis Gary Powers, the ""U-2 Spy"", is shot down over Russia and captured. Now Donovan becomes the negotiator in a potential prisoner swap...Interesting story, especially as it is largely true and involves a very well-known historic event - the U-2 Spy. The negotiations and brinkmanship towards the end are quite intriguing.However, feels clumsy, idealistic and, at times, contrived. The first part of the movie deals very heavy-handedly with Abel's trial. The character of Donovan also seems too goody-two-shoesy to be the real Donovan.Certainly not Steven Spielberg's best direction - far from it. The movie seems to lack engagement and what there is is overly contrived and sentimental. Plus I quite quickly got irritated with his over- use of the last image of one scene being a segue to a new, unrelated, scene. Just felt very cheesy and amateurish.Being a Steven Spielberg film, we have Tom Hanks in the lead role. He puts in a fairly solid performance. Mark Rylance got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Abel. Not sure why - he doesn't have that much dialogue and his screen time is fairly limited too.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","fabiolpinheiro1993","26 November 2015","Well What can i say? Spielberg did it again! This is a film that has that instant feeling you just love it and you're watching something truly special. And its a true story, and i'm a sucker for true stories.The story its another great lesson to be learned by humanity, and the screenplay does an outstanding job telling it. It has all the ingredients Spielberg is known for, the hope in humanity, the believe in the mans power to change the course of history for the good, the true selfless, and so on. The cast is beyond perfect, and everyone gives amazing performances, but of course Tom Hanks steals the show, he gives one of his most likable performances, in the end the character helps a lot. Its just a bigger than life character which fits like a glove in Tom Hanks. The other characters are also amazing, but the one that stands the most to me, even if hes not the one to appear the most, is the Russian spy (Mark Rylance) hes just one of those characters that his so unique and likable that is amazing.The production values are just top notch as one would expect from a Spielberg film. The visuals are hauntingly beautiful and perfectly illustrate the feel of the cold war. The film is amazingly shot, there's a scene with an aircraft that is breathtaking. The special effects are perfect. The production design is bound to be nominated for an Oscar, special attention to the Berlin settings. The score is another hit for Thomas Newman, though the film has this amazing atmosphere were there's very little score and the one there is is mainly in the final minutes. This gives a very authentic and realistic feeling to the film, its like you are really rgere. Thats why i was surprised that the length of the score is almost 50 minutes! Overall the film has a lot in common with Lincoln, its really the perfect follower to that amazing picture. This is one of those films where you just get lost in the story, it's a very immersive film, a true masterpiece thats bound to get a ton of nominations from the academy.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Troy_Campbell","26 October 2015","Spielberg, Hanks, Coen Brothers. Rarely have there been so many members of the Hollywood royal family working together on a single motion picture. With this calibre of talent involved the expectations are unsurprisingly sky high; unfortunately this Cold War true story lands in the 'good, but not good enough' category and subsequently feels like a missed opportunity. At first it's difficult to pinpoint why the spark is missing as all the ingredients for an old-school espionage yarn are present, but after careful contemplation it seems to me that Spielberg may be going through the motions. His direction is purposely understated to be sure, although there is a distinct lack of oomph in his narrative propulsion that is strangely un-Spielbergian. There's also never any real sense of Hanks' American attorney being in danger, despite spending large chunks of time in war-torn Berlin liaising with shadowy Russian diplomats and volatile German soldiers. Nevertheless, this thriller predominantly satisfies thanks to another heartfelt performance from main man Hanks. His put upon lawyer is righteous but grounded, intelligent but humble, fearful but optimistic, all with a welcome dash of wit. In fact it's the Brooklyn-set first act that proves the most entertaining, when it's mostly a two-hander between Hanks and Mark Rylance's dryly-humorous Russian spy, the latter damn near stealing the show right from under Hanks' nose. With regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski on hand as director of photography, the movie looks utterly spectacular too, the glowing courtrooms of New York just as impressive as the snowy streets of a war-ravaged Germany. Bridge of Spies is a solid Cold War thriller with a compelling protagonist, yet with the Tinseltown heavyweights involved I can't help but think it's also somewhat of a disappointment.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Hitchcoc","19 October 2015","It's always a bit dangerous to do historical drama, especially when things are within the memories of living people. This is the story of a prisoner exchange involving a Russian spy and U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, whose spy plane was shot down by said Russians. Instead of a series of scenes of weapons fire and close calls, this is a very cerebral movie. Tom Hanks, in sort of an Atticus Finch mode, puts aside the furor of the nation and potential threats to his family, to follow the course of justice. He finds himself dealing with those who must cater to their nations positions in world politics. He also must act without sanction from his own country. Next to Hanks, Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel steals much of the movie. I'm sure some liberties were taken with facts along the way to make it more Hollywood, but this did nothing to diminish a real view of what the Cold War was like. And, yes, I remember ""Duck and cover!""","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","eddie_baggins","26 October 2015","Like the master-craftsman of his art that he is, Steven Spielberg just keeps on producing the goods. Sure his films may include the likes of 1942 and the last misguided Indiana Jones movie outing, but for someone that's directed 31 feature films its incredible there's not an absolute stinker in a career that's spaned in excess of 50 years. Where Bridge of Spies might rank among the bearded hat wearing gurus career however can only be decided by time but there's little doubt this cold war thriller is an absolute treat of cinematic produce.Tense, taut and most tellingly, meticulously shot and edited, Spies is quite possibly Spielberg's finest film in a decade.Working with his usual and trusted production crew including D.O.P Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn (sadly John Williams doesn't score Spies, perhaps he was busy in a galaxy far far away?), Spies really does see Spielberg achieve fantastic overall results, especially from his team up with writers Joel and Ethan Coen who were bought in to touch up Matt Charman's original script.While it's not got the heart of Spielberg's most revered films like E.T, Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan or the pure spectacle of ventures like Jaws or Minority Report, it's still clear Spielberg had a blast creating this thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat almost entirely through its scripting and construction. Spies in many ways feels cut from the same cloth as Spielberg's Munich, just much more tightly focused.In recent times Spielberg may've achieved good if not stunning outcomes in tales like Lincoln and War Horse but Spies is just a purely unbridled joy led by yet another great Spielberg directed performance of Tom Hanks.Himself experiencing good not incredible films of recent times, Spies allows Hanks to once more display the everyman American that's driven his career and his hardworking lawyer that really just wants a good night's sleep, James B. Donovan, will here go down as one of his all times best.His the star of the ensemble, Spielberg allowing him a showing in almost every scene and Hanks nails it. Delivering just like the film around him does, seemingly with the ease of the ticking of a clocks second hand.Put simply, a near faultless production that lacks ever so slightly some true emotional punches or set pieces that would've made it a 5 star masterpiece, Bridge of Spies is yet again further reminder to all as to why Spielberg is the true movie making king and this is a film that will likely see him and his crew seriously contend at the next Oscar ceremony.Bridge of Spies is without question a definite much watch for all cinema lovers.4 ½ American breakfast's out of 5","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","SnoopyStyle","18 April 2016","It's 1957 Brooklyn. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested for being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is pushed to defend him. Despite popular pressure, Donovan fights to prevent Abel's execution. When U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers is shoot down over the Soviet Union, CIA director Allen Dulles recruits Donovan to test out the prisoner exchange idea as a private citizen. American student Frederic Pryor gets imprisoned on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. Donovan decides to hold out for both Americans' release.Director Steven Spielberg delivers a well-made movie. However, there is a lack of tension for most of the movie. Spielberg needs to ramp up the danger to Donovan. He needs to gin up more danger to his job and to his family. The shooting into his house is fine. I expected a scene of his wife getting confronted. Having said that, other scenes seem too heavy-handed especially the last few scenes back home. Spielberg is also putting in too much of a glare which gives the movie a dreamy quality. Instead, it needs a darker, harsher, and scarier tone. Tom Hanks is a bit too calm. He needs to be scared in more times. The time he's confronted by the street youths in East Berlin is a prime example. It needs to be shocking and it needs to come out of nowhere. Instead, it's laid out before it happens and it's a source of comedy afterward. The tension is never too high. It could have been a darker, scarier scene.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Leofwine_draca","25 January 2018","I always find Spielberg a hit-and-miss director; for every winning thriller like MUNICH there's a piece of tat like INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL to come along and reduce the director's stature in my eyes. Thankfully, BRIDGE OF SPIES is one of his mature films, which translates into talkiness which is never boring thanks to a very strong script that recalls great Cold War thrillers like THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. Tom Hanks is once again a likeable, quick-thinking everyman who this time around is tasked with defending a Russian spy in the courts. I remember despising Mark Rylance's WOLF HALL when I attempted watching it, but Rylance is at the top of his game here and extremely likeable as the self-effacing spy. The film's true story origins means it has the ring of authenticity throughout and Spielberg admirably avoids sentimentality, instead presenting complex characters working their way through complicated situations. The end result is a film which delights from beginning to end.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Prismark10","21 January 2017","Bridge of Spies is a pedestrian cold war drama that combines the talents of Steven Spielberg and the Coen brothers. It really is a literal title as the climax takes place on a bridge and it has spies.Tom Hanks plays an insurance lawyer. We are meant to root for him even though as he tries to stiff a personal injury lawyer. Remember folks, his insured driver injured five people but he wants to limit it as one claim.Hanks really has the hang of these types of characters now, sturdy, steady, steadfast with just a hint of overacting. He plays James Donovan who is called in to defend Rudolf Abel a captured KGB spy operating in the USA. He places his life at risk to save him from the death penalty, being astute enough to realise that Abel may become useful in later years. So it does when the Russians capture a U-2 spy plane pilot. Donovan then has to put his personal safety at risk by going to East Germany to negotiate a spy swap.The film features a critically acclaimed performance from Mark Rylance who plays Abel and won a best supporting actor Oscar. Rylance is an example of a subtle, understated performance.Spielberg is a master craftsman but the film is just too cumbersome and stuffy. It never has the labyrinthic thrills of a John Le Carre story. There is some wonderful art direction but the film really needed some zap.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","classicsoncall","13 June 2016","This is a compelling character study set amid the espionage and drama of the Cold War between America and the Soviets. What really got my attention was when part of James Donovan's (Tom Hanks) argument against the death penalty for Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) relied largely on foreseeing the day when an American might be arrested on similar charges, and a live prisoner might be the key to an exchange. Cold War paranoia is more than evident in the early part of the story, Donovan's own son asks him, ""You're not a Communist, so why are you defending one""? It's not made clear how much Donovan's pressure impacted the judge in sentencing Abel, who early on insisted this was an open and shut case, with Donovan's court strategy merely window dressing. I was surprised how little time was offered for Francis Gary Powers' (Austin Stowell) role in the film, but that apparently was not the emphasis of the story. I was only six years old when these events unfolded but somehow (amazingly) can recall Powers' name in headlines of the day.There's always a question about historical accuracy with films like this, but that shouldn't sway one's interest in seeing the picture. The story is gripping and does a good job in demonstrating Donovan's resolve to protect his client's rights while remaining faithful to the principles of the Constitution. His reaction to East Germans being shot at the Berlin Wall attempting to escape was an unsubtle reminder that even though the events depicted occurred over a half century ago, they still resonate strongly with viewers who were alive at the time.","4/10"
"Bridge of Spies","kosmasp","20 May 2016","But it's either a very big gap or a very big bridge (or maybe both). So to some this may feel too long. What it definitely is true, is the fact that the movie takes its time to tell the (true) story behind it all. While Spielberg probably took some liberties (as almost every filmmaker does when they tackle a true life story/incident), this is very interesting and tense stuff.Though you wouldn't know when looking at the main character (besides the one Tom Hanks is playing), because of him underplaying everything. Was the real person like that? Haven't read much about that, but the movie may take a couple of people to take a look into that. And for that, the movie achieved what it wanted: Putting a spotlight on something not many are aware of. Spielberg and Kaminsky always deliver when it comes to settings/camera of course, acting is great too, so it's kind of a ""no-brainer""","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Quietb-1","19 October 2015","Here's a bloated lack of action full of talk from the Director of some really great movies. If you know the story you know the outcome. If you don't know the story you know nothing bad will happen to Tom Hanks. Maybe a John Williams score could have helped this but he didn't get the job. The movie is too long. It takes a long time getting going and you'll be looking at your watch wondering when is something going to happen.If you like 1956 and 1957 Chevrolets this movie is for you. The car is everywhere including East Berlin and even at the bridge in the title. It looks like the same 1956 car appears in different locations in the first sequence. You know a movie is not captivating if you are looking for product placement or movie cars.A couple of good performances make this bearable. There is a scene near the end where the kids call their mother into the room to watch the news story. Seems odd that they knew what was coming and laughable they would call in their parents.The Janusz Kaminski Cinematography looks good on the big screen. Maybe if you lower your expectations you won't be too disappointed. Looking for a great Spielberg movie skip this and watch ""Jaws"" ""Munich"" ""Schindler's List"" ""Raiders"" or almost anything but ""Lincoln"".","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","ElMaruecan82","17 February 2016","In the midst of the Cold War paranoia, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) a lawyer specialized in insurance settlement is assigned to defend KGB spy Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance in a performance that will deserve a few words. This is less a trial than a tactic to prevent the Soviet Union to politically exploit Abel's arrest: Abel's case must show the world that USA treated him democratically. But that's only a cover, what Donovan ignores. Like so many characters who populated Hanks' filmography, Donovan is a decent man and much more, a professional. He takes his job seriously and when he discovers that much of the evidence was found without search warrants, he even wants to call a vice of form.So, what we get is a highly respected lawyer, with an Irish name, a respectable family, and a 'Red' who might have pulled a Rozenberg in his actions and be the cause of New York's imminent nuking, in the minds of millions of Americans or kids, constantly brainwashed by these Nuclear mushroom images (you know these 'duck and cover' programs). Naturally, Abel's public image inevitably spills over Donovan who worries everyone from his family to his colleagues, from the prosecutors to the judge, and his zeal doesn't help. That, alone, would have been the premise of a terrific movie, the contradiction of a man who does his job, out of decency and patriotism and is almost treated like a traitor. To think that there were supposed to counter-attack the Russian propaganda is one of these film's many subtle delights and it doesn't come as a surprise, that within this whole paranoid craze, you have these two men who seem to speak the same language.It is not a friendship in the cinematic sense of the word, but it's a story of respect between two men who know the context they live in, their duty, their limitations, but still, find a 'bridge' of communication, through such simple matters as honor, principles and humanity. Rylance's performance looks like a one-note one, but don't get mislead, this is a man who was trained not to show any emotions, to keep a low-profile, so it's only through his eye-language, and a few words, that you can get to the core of his feelings. He says he's not afraid of the electric chair, but his stoicism is later counterbalanced by the 'although it wouldn't be my first choice'. This is not some robotic spy, this is a human being who's also caught in the requirements of his job. And his attitude, if not the public's, earns him Donovan's everlasting sympathy.Tom Hanks, as usual, doesn't need to speak loudly his emotions, we can see that from the way he exchanges looks with Rylance, and after Abel's sentence, he pleads to Supreme Court arguing that there's no way, the USA should treat dishonorably a man who's only following a fighter's code the same way that America wished his men would follow the Constitution. There has to be a reciprocity of actions and treatments, not just in the weapon department. And what could have been a terrific climactic speech is only the precursor of the second act of the movie. Of course, there was no way, Abel would be found innocent, he wasn't anyway, so the film had to move to higher levels, and it does.It's interesting that Donovan worked in insurance, this is a man who made a living out of predicting odds, and in 1957, it didn't take the highest insurance exec to guess one American spy might be arrested once, and Abel could be used as a bargaining chip. His eloquence convinces the judge and Abel escapes from the Rozenberg treatment, and of course, it pays off, as a spy pilot, Gary Michael Powers, is shut down while traveling above the Soviet territory on U-21 plane. Donovan is then entrusted to negotiate the exchange of prisoners, which would've been a formality if it wasn't for a little twist: the arrest of an American student in Berlin while attempting to get his girlfriend to the West Side. When Donovan learns about this arrest, he can't imagine going back to America with only one person. The film turns into a very interesting chess game where Donovan must hit two birds with one stone, he must convince the Soviet and the East-German representatives, understand their motives, express his, and make the timing his ally, rather than an obstacle. It's a heart-pounding race against the clock.Although Steven Spielberg isn't renowned for being the most subtle director when it comes to emotions, his recent ""Lincoln"" was a signal that the tone of his movies abandoned their usual sentimentalism to some more mature material. Lincoln was less the noble-hearted hero than a positively Machiavellian tactician, and this is what Donovan is. And he plays the diplomatic game perfectly, learning how to be mild-mannered or firmly resolved, in the middle of a Cold War that wasn't just symbolically cold. This leads to a wonderful climax, whose first element of surprise is to reveal that the film's title wasn't just a metaphor.Now, I read many comments accusing the film of being another propaganda movie. I would say it's more of Capra-like movie in its spirit. Besides, wasn't Abel the most fascinating character of the movie, and a hero to some extent? Weren't the Americans as eager to hang Abel as a Western mob to lynch a cattle thief, and didn't one of the CIA guys even care of the American student? In fact, ""Bridge of Spies"" is beyond these considerations, it is less a thriller with two antagonistic sides, than a great character study with two similar men united by their patriotism and their sense of duty. And no matter how different the lifestyles are, two systems making such men possible can't be that bad.","1/10"
"Bridge of Spies","gavin6942","24 January 2016","During the Cold War, an American lawyer (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.The film is nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (for Rylance), Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay. Let us address those in reverse order.There is no doubt the screenplay is strong, and another feather in the caps of the Coen brothers. Whether or not you consider it to be ""best"" probably comes down to one thing: do you prefer a good story or do you prefer historical accuracy? If you prefer historical accuracy, you are going to have qualms with this picture because Donovan (Hanks) is very false. He is portrayed as an insurance attorney rather than the intelligence operative he was, and he is shown as the victim of multiple acts of violence, which he was not. So that will be an automatic hangup for some people who frown on dramatic exaggeration and poetic license.If one looks at it a bit more forgivingly, though, it is an incredible script that covers the Constitution, the Cold War, the interaction of various governments and their agents... it tells the story of one attorney defending a despicable client because it is the right thing to do (a la ""To Kill a Mockingbird"") and the better-known tale of Gary Powers and the U-2 spy plane. Is it sensationalized? Somewhat. A little melodramatic with its patriotism? Yes. But still a darn fine story, and whether a winner or not, clearly a strong contender for best screenplay.How about production design? This one is a bit of a challenge. The work that went into this film is incredible, bringing everything on screen back to the 1950s and 1960s. Every car, every outfit, and even the most inconsequential detail had to be touched. How you compare this to the futuristic sets of ""Mad Max"" or the science-driven world of ""The Martian"", who knows? It is like comparing apples and oranges. While ""Bridge of Spies"" will probably not carry this category, those who worked on securing all the necessary scenery deserve top honors.The supporting actor category is where ""Bridge of Spies"" has its best chance of winning an award. Mark Rylance is not an actor whose work I am familiar with, because he has primarily distinguished himself on the stage. So it is hard to say how much he is going outside of his normal range here. But he gives us an interesting character. While ""best actors"" are often intense or pushed to their limits, Rylance is quite the opposite: subtle and understated. But it makes fora powerful, compelling nemesis you cannot help but like in some way. He would be deserving of the award.Which leaves us with best picture. And the short answer is no, this is not a contender. The nomination makes sense, but the film never seems to hit all cylinders. Although nothing is lacking, it still feels somehow incomplete. ""Bridge of Spies"" is not the film of the year, nor is it among Spielberg's best.","7/10"

However, it was so slow moving that if it was not for the director name and Tom Hanks I would have walked out of it. Yes, you read that correctly. There was really nothing moving about the movie and the over saturated directing made it even worse. The main few events were played over and over so much that the end of the story felt blaise.

"Bridge of Spies","rmax304823","1 July 2016","In the early 50s, the quiet, middle-aged amateur artist, Walter Abel is arrested. He's a Soviet spy. Tom Hanks is appointed to defend him but it's all supposed to be pro forma. Hanks is supposed to wave the fourth amendment, mention due process and protection from search and seizure, then sit down and shut up. But he takes his job as defense counsel seriously and nobody likes it. He can't possibly get Abel off but still he's defending a Russky espionage agent. Everyone is anxious to see this guy get the chair. It was disheartening to see that the director has Hanks sitting on a subway at this point while all the strap hangers are reading about the trial in the newspapers and glare at him. The reason it's disheartening is that such a scene surely never happened in real life. Who the hell knows what Abel's defense attorney looked like -- or if they had seen photos of him, would recognize the innocent Hanks sitting on a subway train. And another reason that it's disheartening is that the director doesn't trust the audience to know what's already been made clear -- Hanks is ill thought of because he's defending a hated enemy. Really, earlier scenes in court and at Hanks' home have made that very clear.The judge is eager to hang Abel too, but Hanks, an insurance lawyer, visits the judge at home and points out that if Abel is put in prison instead of the graveyard, the U. S. will have a little something in its back pocket to trade in case something similar happens to one of our agents in Moscow. Just in case, you know, kind of like an insurance policy. The judge is convinced and Abel gets thirty years, much to the anger of the public at large. While the two sit quietly in the visiting room listening to Shostakovitch, Able remarks, not unkindly, that Hanks ""should be careful"", and in fact a couple of bullets are fired through the windows of his home. When he loses his appeal to the Supreme Court, it's back to the insurance business for Hanks. He's summarily snubbed.Meanwhile, however, there has been a parallel story. The CIA has developed the super-secret U-2, a spy plane whose service altitude is 70,000 feet. That's pretty high up, out of the range of known Soviet missiles. But then, as Leo Strauss has pointed out, there are ""unknown unknowns"" and one of them is that Soviet missiles can bring down an airplane at 70,000 feet, which they duly do. The pilot, Francis Gary Powers, has been instructed to destroy both himself and the airplane if it should be brought down in Russian territory but he's unable to do either. The Soviets get both prizes and make the most of their exploit in the media, embarrassing president Dwight D. Eisenhower who at first claimed no knowledge of the spying. (This detail isn't in the movie.) Powers is tried and given ten years in a Soviet prison. Ugh.Hanks is given the job of arranging a prisoner exchange in East Berlin, all on his own. His mission is to trade Abel for Powers and another guy, Pryor, a graduate student from Yale who was detained for no particular reason. Again, it's not mentioned in the movie but John F. Kennedy was president at the time and Hanks' character had his full backing except that Kennedy, a Harvard man, said he ""wouldn't bust his *** getting a Yale man out."" The CIA cares nothing at all about Pryor. They only want to get Powers back, although they all hate him for having survived. The fact that Powers has suffered in an East German prison and kept awake for extended periods to squeeze information out of him means nothing to the CIA. In the end, due to Hanks' determination, the swap is accomplished after much bureaucratic haggling, and both Americans are released, while Abel is sent back to his family.Good stuff. Nice photography and visual f/x. The scene of Powers' U-2 being shot down is thrilling. Tom Hanks brings an unusual edginess to the role of the central figure. He's jumpy, nervous, speaks rapidly, paces. Think of Gregory Peck. Now think of the opposite, except for the concordant confidence. As James B. Donovan, Hanks has a wife and two lovely kiddies. The kids are a little cute, but Hanks' wife, Amy Ryan, is just about right. She's pretty without being Hollywood gorgeous. And she doesn't provide unconditional support, nor does she nag. Nice job of writing. The standout performance is by Mary Rylance as Rudolf Abel. Rylance gives us a wimpy little spy, wily, artistic, unflappable. He's taciturn and when he speaks it's with a Scottish accent and what he says is keenly perceptive. It's never slow because with the exception of Abel, all the character speak quickly, as in a thirty-second TV commercial. At time it felt as if the camera were undercranked.The director, Spielberg, could easily have ruined the film by turning Hanks into a brave and resolute hero instead of a guy who insists on playing by the rules, who is anxious to get home and go to bed, who is frightened when cornered by some German kids who demand his warm coat in the middle of winter. Abel could have been turned into a stereotypical Russian spy, bald, ugly, and snarling defiantly. Instead of being snubbed after his return, Francis Gary Powers might have been hailed as a proud representative of Uncle Sam and given a ticker tape parade. And so on until we're not watching an adult movie but a children's cartoon.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","michaelRokeefe","20 May 2016","Spielberg and Hanks; is that enough of a drawing card? Steven Spielberg re-investigates a decades old historical event. Fact-based and liberties taken in this fact-bound story. Thrill and suspense driven almost documentary-style drama that takes place during the height of the Cold War in 1960. An American U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary powers is downed by the Soviets. And a KGB mole Rudolf Abel is captured in New York in 1957.Hanks plays James Donovan, a Brooklyn insurance claims lawyer that just happens to be a former Nuremburg trial prosecutor is picked to negotiate a trade with the USSR. The transfer of spies is to be made on the Glienicke Bridege that links West Berlin with Potsdam. If things aren't exactly trustworthy at first, Donovan on his own initiative wants to pull in a third man into the swap. An American med student, Frederic Pryor, has been detained on the hostile side of the Berlin Wall. Now the trade appears lopsided...two Americans for Abel.This movie moves to its own rhythm and suspense proves to be the substance to propel the tricky trade. Mark Rylance as Abel may just be the real star; not that Hanks doesn't dig deep. Also in the cast: Alan Alda, Amy Ryan, Mark Fichera, Brian Hutchison, Domenick Lombardozzi, Joshua Harto and Victor Verhaeghe.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","richardchatten","20 March 2022","Mark Rylance's laconic Colonel Abel (improbably but authentically speaking English with a Scots accent) lies at the heart of this drama; but Tom Hawks being the bigger star dominates the footage and accounts for the film's whopping running time.Had this story actually been filmed in 1960 it would have been terser and in black & white; over fifty years later Steven Spielberg bathes it in a nostalgic glow with Edward Hopper lighting and '77 Sunset Strip' on the telly and 'Spartacus' at the pictures.In the light of current events in the Ukraine it's sympathetic portrayal of a Russkie might raise eyebrows (particularly as Abel in one scene praises Shostakovich, who'd been given an extremely hard time by the very regime he served); but the incredible heroism shown only last week by Marina Ovsyannikova is a salutary reminder that not all Russians are monsters.","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","namashi_1","17 October 2015","Based on the 1960 U-2 incident & set during the Cold War, 'Bridge of Spies' is a Brilliant true-story, told Brilliantly.

James B. Donovan's fight to get back the ones who belong home & also send the one to his place, without ever disgracing anyone, is engrossing. Its such a powerful, riveting true-story, that I was left amazed. Matt Charman, Ethan Coen & Joel Coen's Screenplay is excellent. It never slows down & the way this story progresses, is awe-inspiring. The Writing remains super-strong at all times! Spielberg's Direction is flawless. The Master Filmmaker has handled this historical dramatic thriller, without one single fault. Janusz Kamiński's Cinematography is picture-perfect. Michael Kahn's Editing is razor-crisp. Thomas Newman's Score is superb (Although its strange not to hear John Williams's musical genius here, since he's a Spielberg regular). Art & Costume Design are efficient.Performance-Wise: Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan, is commanding, as ever. The Screen Legend ignites the proceedings, with magnetic energy. Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel, is the scene-stealer. He enacts the spy in question, magnificently. And the on-screen chemistry between Hanks & Rylance, is enviable. Amy Ryan as Mary McKenna Donovan, does well. Alan Alda as Thomas Watters, is impeccable, as always. Austin Stowell as Francis Gary Powers, leaves a mark.

"Bridge of Spies","tonyhaines-spp","17 October 2015","It was opening night, the theater was packed and I was expecting greatness. After all, this story is right in Spielberg's wheelhouse. The time period, cold war, Tom Hanks, the stars were aligned. I will start with this notion, Spielberg's movies are always well acted, always well shot and always beautifully scored. Bridge of Spies does not fail this standard. There are clearly some remarkable acting performances. It wouldn't be a surprise to see some trophies handed out for this work. The director got what he needed, superb acting. The actors did not get what they need, superb story telling. It is the only thing missing here but it's a biggie. If you know anything about the real life story of James Donovan you could easily imagine a truly exciting movie. The opening credit sequence included this line...Based on Real Events. This disclaimer gives license to the director to ""Hollywood up"" the story. So basically there are no excuses. In Munich, the director pealed your sole with great story telling, tension and acting. Bridge of Spies had that potential, at least, that's what I was expecting. Tension was left out of this movie for some reason. I theorize Spielberg did this intensionally. Why? Somebody should ask him.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","KineticSeoul","26 June 2016","So this is a talking movie, with a LOT of talking going around without much action. Actually there is almost no action at all. So if you are looking forward to watching a action movie with spies going on espionage and trying to assassinate people, this isn't that kind of movie. When it comes to talking movies, the story, the dialogue and the performances has to take center stage. And this movie has all three of those elements without it going to a very convoluted and overly political direction. So most mainstream audiences will understand what is going on, on screen. However for me, what made this movie really work is Steven Spielberg classic direction. Where the premise is uplifting while having a sense of humanity. The cinematography really does have the tenacity to keep audiences like me focused for the most part. This is a historical film that is based on a true story. So the plot is about James B. Donovan played by Tom Hanks who is a lawyer that takes on the task of defending a soviet spy. And the negotiation and what goes behind the scenes of the American and Soviet politics. It delves into humanity and the will power to stand up for what is right, although a lot of people will resent you for it. Although this isn't a movie I would sit through the whole thing again, it was well worth the watch.8/10","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Thanos_Alfie","6 February 2016","""Bridge of Spies"" is a Drama movie which tells the story of lawyer James B. Donovan who is entrusted to negotiate the release of an American pilot from Soviet Union in exchange a captive Soviet KGB spy who is held by the United States.I liked this movie a lot due to the fact that first of all is based on something that happened in reality and secondly because of the plot of it. In addition to this the cast of this movie was selected very nice with Tom Hanks who played as the lawyer James B. Donovan to make a very good interpretation. Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was made by Mark Rylance who played as Rudolf Abel the Soviet spy. The direction of Steven Spielberg for one more time was exceptional and this can be seen very easily in the whole duration of the movie.Finally I believe that ""Bridge of Spies"" is a very good movie to watch and is a lesson for everyone because it represents and shows the difficulty of the job that this lawyer took over and how the choices that he made affect him but his family too.","9/10"

Those brought up on John Le Carré might perhaps expect from this moral equivalence, shabby compromise and exhausted futility. But Spielberg, with his gift for uncynicism, uncovers decency and moral courage amidst all the Realpolitik. He works from an excellent screenplay by up-and-coming British dramatist Matt Charman, a script punched up in recognisable places by Joel and Ethan Coen.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","lesleyharris30","19 July 2016","Bridge of Spies is a stellar movie with a very well developed plot and a magnificent cast. We are almost immediately taken in to the drama and intensity of this true story from the very beginning, as we follow an insurance lawyer who is tasked with defending a Soviet spy who has betrayed his country. We manage to gain support from the spy as we see his point of view, beautifully captured by the great Steven Spielberg. On the other hand, I did feel that it did not give us enough insight on the seriousness of the Cold War. There is a scene where Donovan views a bunch of people being shot down while travelling on a train, I would like to to have seen more of this, to emphasise the struggles this movie is dealing with. The performances are the highlight of it all, Tom Hanks is breathtaking as the lead role, James Donovan, perfectly conveying the transformation of an everyday lawyer turned hero, and Mark Rylance delivers a well deserved Oscar win as Rudolf Abel, a flawed, conflicted character who we can not help but support as a result of Rylance's charm. Terrificly acted, superb direction and a great script, Bridge of Spies is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. An insurance lawyer is tasked with defending a Soviet spy, a job that ends up stretching far beyond the courtroom. Best Performance: Tom Hanks / Worst Performance: Alan Alda","6/10"

Once again Donovan is enlisted to help, but his plans are different than what the government wants. First thing, this is a great movie. I really enjoyed this and was entertained by it the entire time. I will say there isn't a lot of action in this and the movie really had the feel of Lincoln. To me that's not a bad thing but just a heads up. Hanks is good as usual and really brings compassion to this role. The fact that this is based on true events makes the movie that much more exciting and tense. This is a movie that I highly recommend, but again may not be for everyone. Overall, Hanks and Spielberg hit another home run. For a history buff like me this was one of the best movies of the year. I give this a B+.","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","stevendbeard","16 October 2015","I saw ""Bridge of Spies"", starring Tom Hanks-Saving Mr. Banks, Captain Phillips; Mark Rylance-The Gunman, The Other Boleyn Girl; Alan Alda-The Blacklist_tv, What Women Want and Amy Ryan-Goosebumps, Escape Plan.This is based on a true story that takes place in 1957. Steven Spielberg directs this cold war story about a Soviet spy captured on American soil, Mark, who is arrested and asked to move into one of our fine prison establishments, or maybe even be executed for treason. Tom plays a New York lawyer that is convinced by the C.I.A. to represent Mark-they think they should show the world that even a dirty Soviet spy deserves a good defense. Alan plays Tom's boss and agrees with the C.I.A. and tells Tom to go ahead and take the job. Around this same time, an American pilot, Francis Gary Powers, is shot down over Soviet air space, while taking reconnaissance pictures from a U2 spy plane at 70,000 feet. The C.I.A. wants Tom to negotiate a prisoner exchange with Mark for the pilot. Since Tom has to go to Germany for the talks, and it is as the wall is being built in Berlin so it is dangerous, Tom tells his wife, Amy, that he is going on a fishing trip-he doesn't want her to worry. The exchange of prisoners is to take place on a bridge between East Berlin and West Berlin, so that is where the title of the movie, Bridge of Spies, comes from. It is a good story-what else do you expect from a Steven Spielberg movie?-but light on action. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a good rental.","3/10"
"Bridge of Spies","bryank-04844","14 October 2015","The year 2015 gives us yet another Tom Hanks/Steven Spielberg movie called 'Bridge of Spies' with an added bonus of the Coen Bros. serving as co-writers. Now with a cast and crew like this, I expect something that would live on forever and win all the awards come award season. That's not really the case here though, as Spielberg's recent directorial efforts have been lacking a bit. I'm not saying they're bad, I'm just saying that 'War Horse' and 'Lincoln' were long, slow, dreary period pieces with no real momentum, despite some awards and critical acclaim.That being said, I bet any of you a hundred king-size Snicker's bars that you haven't watch or even thought of those two films since they were released. This all could be said about 'Bridge of Spies', which is of course, well made, interesting, fun, and well-acted, but really only worth one viewing and no more. Once it ends, you'll immediately forget about it and start thinking of Spielberg's next project, which a return to the sci-fi arena with 'Ready Player One'. I'm of the mindset that all of Spielberg's movies are worthy of unlimited viewings, no matter what time of day or night it is.It's just unfortunate that 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of those instances. All that being said, 'Bridge of Spies' is technically top notch with Tom Hanks giving another good performance. Set during the height of the Cold War, a soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is caught in New York City and put to trial unjustly. Meanwhile, the US sent some new U-2 spy planes do to take some images of Mother Russia, where one plane was shot down over the Soviet Union, where the pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) survived the crash and was captured and put in prison.Back in Brooklyn, lawyer James B. Donovan (Hanks) was forced to defend the Russian spy they caught and make sure he had a fair trial, but with the new information, he is tasked to try and make a deal to release the spies back into their country's custody. A trade off if you will. From here, Donovan has to weave in and out of high level Russian buildings, as he tries to broker a deal, which if not executed correctly, could have started a major war. There are plenty of Spielberg-ian moments to be had, which is always nice to see and Hanks's performance again is solid, however not on par with some of his previous work.The script is tight and to the point, but there isn't really any guts or memorable moments in this film. It plays for a good two and a half hours, all of which are mildly entertaining, but in the end, it's completely forgettable, which is unfortunate, because you have Spielberg, Hanks, and the Coen Bros. here.Worth a Look!","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","gest1969","8 January 2016","I am a Cold War child, born in a country which did have common borders with a Warsaw Pact member but was never a target of thermonuclear destruction. I was still at primary school when I came across a couple of serialized excerpts from Powers' memoir. He really caught my imagination. I saw ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" and ""Across the Bridge"" (with Rod Steiger), films in which the bridge is both the passage and the frontier, a no-man's land in which destinies can be decided in a split second of hesitation or bad luck.Bridge of Spies was a great disappointment. Cars and costumes were fine but the spirit and the people of the era was absent. I don't understand why, when I think of ""Munich"" or ""Schindler's List"", when there are so many novels to consult for the atmosphere and so many memoirs to consult for the facts. Why was Powers pictured with such unkind shallowness? Why were CIA men and DDR functionaries such caricatures? No matter how great Mark Rylance was, where was the motivation and the ideology of the Soviet spy? Where were the political leaders of the two superpowers? How did the little lawyer from the Bronx become such a cool operative behind the lines, from one day to the other, without experiencing any fear or trepidation?There is nothing wrong with high morals or nostalgia in cinema but when a film tries to portray an episode from a complex political and ideological conflict serving only these ingredients, then I can only be disappointed at the waste of means and opportunities. Pity.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Reno-Rangan","14 February 2016","The movie that should have been made 50 years ago, but due to the international political tension it did not take off. So now it's here, the same director made it. It's a rocking combo, once again Spielberg and Hanks come together, tell me who's going to miss that. Simply spellbinding, one of the best movie of the year.I think this flick is for adults. There's no sex, no nudity, not even a single kiss or the bad language and zero violence, its fine for teens and kids can understand, but the story is what I meant that suits only for the grown ups. Like the usual, this Spielberg movie is easy to follow, there's no tricky twists and turns, but aimed for only the event that's based on the real.Over a 2 hour long negotiation drama with surrounded by suspense and thrills. It's completely a one man show and the end has been just like everybody wanted. I'm not surprised that it is nominated for the Oscars in the 6 categories including the best motion picture. I would be very happy if it puts at least a couple of trophies to its basket. I feel it is a must see if you're interested in WWII related subjects, other than the war.8½/10","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","kgprophet","23 October 2015","Although this is an exceptional story that enjoys examining the minutia of the period, the story arc as a whole does not really offer anything new. This leaves the performances as the primary appeal for the film. Tom Hanks has proved himself as the Average Joe of this generation. Then again, I never felt he was really in peril at any point in the film, perhaps because of his role in Captain Phillips or even Saving Private Ryan. In those films he was an Average Joe who nevertheless had the courage to face violence when necessary. One of my favourite films with Tom Hanks starring is Road To Perdition. Because that was also a period piece, sometimes I felt I was watching the mafia character he portrayed. The most standout performance is Mark Rylance playing Abel, the Soviet spy caught in the U.S. He certainly could get an Oscar nod for a supporting actor.The story rolls along well enough, the longer length of the film comes from the fact that two stories are told. First is the capture and conviction of Abel in America. The second story follows the downing of Francis Powers and the setup of the exchange. I think some places to condense the exchange story could have brought the film back closer to a more appropriate two hours. Why? Well, I forgave Spielberg for the longer running time in Lincoln, because that film also had such a large cast to flesh out, and most of those characters were the real attraction in that film. Here, time is spent with Hanks visiting many East German characters that aren't particularly noteworthy, along with a few side trips that ultimately slow the momentum.One thing that has become annoying is the one-note style of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. As usual, every scene has a washed out backlight. Spielberg is known for incorporating longer single-take shots that are well choreographed, traveling along with the momentum of the scene. Oddly, he is too constrained with that style, where I was hoping some dynamic camera-work would provide a unique perspective of some interesting locations. I can't say I totally disagree with that decision, other than when a dynamic shot occurs, such as one showing the sentencing of Francis Powers, it seems it is the only time the films shows any real visual energy. The music hits the right beats, but again, does not try to stand out in any way.I doubt general movie goers will embrace this movie. The subject matter will not really connect with anyone beyond those who enjoy period pieces like this. Hanks' character, unfortunately, has no Oscar moments to emote. The climax of the film also doesn't have any fireworks in the normal sense. I would recommend this film as a chance to get a glimpse of a piece of history you probably never knew before. But I would not really not call it one of the best films of the year, or a highlight of either Spielberg's or Hanks' career.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","leonblackwood","30 August 2016","Review: It's not very often that I can say a bad word about a Spielberg/Hanks collaboration but in this case, I have to say that I found this movie pretty boring. Although the subject matter was deep and emotional, I found the pace of the film, extremely slow and it just seemed to be going round in circles most of the time. Tom Hanks (James B. Donovan) and Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel) played there roles extremely well and they made the movie slightly watchable but I still struggled to keep my eyes open, through the negotiating scenes between Hanks, the Germans and the Russians. On the plus side, the whole look and feel of the film is top class and the period was filmed well by one of the best directors of all time but after the disappointing movie, War Horse, I was expecting more from this movie. The whole ""Russian Spy"" concept wasn't really shocking, even though it was based on true events, and the outcome of Donovan's actions was more interesting than the film. The fact that Abel was actually a spy, seemed to be overlooked and you don't get to see what problems his actions had caused in the past. Anyway, although the movie looked top class, I didn't really find it that entertaining and I won't be rushing to watch the movie again. Average! Round-Up: Steven Spielberg, 69, is one of those directors that people will flock to the cinemas to watch his movies, and when he teams up with Hanks, in movies like the Terminal, Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can, the collaboration usually works. To date, Spielbergs new movie, the BFG, has made $153million but it cost $140million to make so it has just about broken even. Its been a long time since this brilliant director has pulled off anything amazing but he will always be remembered for movies like Jaws, Close Encounters, the Indiana franchise, E.T., the Colour Purple, Jurassic Park etc. With another Indiana Jones and West Side Story, rumoured to be his next projects, I still find it quite surprising that he has only won 3 Oscars, 2 for Schindler's List and one for Saving Private Ryan but I'm sure he will get a lifetime achievement award for his contribution to cinema. His vision and amazing storytelling skills are truly unique but this film definitely wasn't one of his best. Tom Hanks has also gone a bit downhill lately but that is mostly due to the movies that he has chosen, and not his superb acting skills. Anyway, although I found this movie pretty boring, I'm sure that there is a market for this subject matter and it must have touched many hearts. Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $165million I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/history/thrillers, starring Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Domenick Lombardozzi, Brian Hutchison, Alan Alda and Amy Ryan. 5/10","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Horst_In_Translation","18 December 2015","""Bridge of Spies"" is the newest Steven Spielberg movie as of 2015 and once again Tom Hanks plays the main character in here. I was particularly curious about this film because I knew they were shooting here about a year ago and there is a lot of German background as the final crucial scene takes place here in Berlin. It is a pretty solid film by the books. Hanks is rock-solid as always and carries this film nicely, even if I would not go so far and say he is among the best performances this year. But he is not getting too much awards attention really, so it's fine I guess. The one getting tons of awards recognition is Mark Rylance, who is even considered a possible Academy Award winner in the supporting category. I thought he was decent, but I am not so sure if he was really that outstanding.Back to the film and away from the performances, this film is a decent watch for everybody with an interest in films about politics. It is set during the Cold War when a Russian spy gets caught and there is an exchange with an American soldier who was held captive in Russia. Most of the film is actually the preparation for this exchange and even the trial of Abel (the Russian spy played by Rylance), in which he faces the death penalty. In my opinion, the film was a bit sterile at times. I never felt any real emotions watching this. So it's not a bad film at all, but I felt the topic could have been dealt with maybe with a more personal approach. Spielberg's direction left me unattached mostly. It was interesting, yes, but I never felt really involved at any point and that is quite a shame as the topic certainly offers material of great emotion as well. Then again, this is a problem that is the case with many Spielberg films in my opinion, but that is just personal perception. I vaguely knew about the exchange, but I'm sure most Americans and non-Germans probably don't, especially the younger generation, which makes it even more informative.Finally, I recommend this movie. I am not too sure how accurate everything we see is and I am sure there are lots of additions for dramatic purpose, but that's not a problem at all. All films have such. And in the end, there is a reference about the main character's negotiations with Fidel Castro, which alone could be material enough for a complete film. I recommend watching ""Bridge of Spies"", even if it's nowhere near my personal favorites from 2015.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","alcorcrisan","19 December 2015","Mark Rylance stands out as the best reason to watch this movie. And, I feel tempted to say, the only reason to do so. His lines take the cream of the screenplay. I am quite a fan of spy movies. That is exactly why I find this to be extremely disappointing as a movie. Seeing Steven Spielberg's name come up at the final credits was a sort of cherry on the funeral cake. The direction and the editing are the two most disappointing elements of this production. Then parts of the story. It is all so predictable, so cliché, so déjà-vu. I happened to watch this film in the weeks in which the BBC broadcast a brilliant 5-part series entitled ""London Spy"". That is everything a spy-film fan can wish for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is everything but that. Underwhelming at best...","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","ferguson-6","16 October 2015","Greetings again from the darkness. For a director, true power in the movie industry means you can obtain the financing and assemble the cast and crew you need to make the films that have meaning to you. With his 40 year career of unmatched combined box office and critical success, Steven Spielberg is the epitome of film power and the master of bringing us dramatized versions of historical characters and events. In his fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, Spielberg tells the story of James B Donovan.You say you aren't familiar with Mr. Donovan? In the late 1950's and early 1960's, the CIA (Allen Dulles was director at the time) persuaded James Donovan to provide a bit of Cold War legal service. Mr. Donovan was by trade an Insurance attorney, but after others in his profession passed on the ""opportunity"", his commitment to justice and human rights drove him to accept the challenge of defending suspected Russian spy named Rudolph Abel. In the face of an angry populace and government, Donovan took the case all the way to the Supreme Court – and his exact words are spoken in the movie by Hanks.Not long after, Francis Powers (played by Austin Stowell) was piloting a CIA U-2 spy plane when he was shot down over Russia and taken captive. This sequence in the film is breathtaking to watch. Enter James Donovan again  this time to negotiate an exchange of prisoners: Rudolph Abel for Francis Powers. It's these negotiations that provide the element of suspense in the story. Mr. Donovan was a family man, but he was also very confident in his ability to negotiate on the biggest stage and under the brightest spotlight (or darkest backroom).The movie is exactly what you would expect from a master filmmaker. Spielberg re-creates the era through sets, locations, and costumes. He utilizes his remarkable eye behind the camera, an interesting use of lighting, and the score from Thomas Newman. Nope, that's not a misprint. It's the first Spielberg movie in 30 years not scored by John Williams (who was unable to work on the project). Of course, the cast is stellar and it all starts with Tom Hanks. He just makes everything look so darn easy! Whether he is talking to his wife (Amy Ryan), his kids (including Bono's daughter Eve Hewson), his law partner (Alan Alda), or agents from the U.S. or Russia  Hanks manages to make each scene real and believable.It's the scenes between Donovan and Rudolph Abel that are the most fascinating to watch. Mark Rylance plays Abel, and to see these two men grow to respect each other for ""doing their job"" is a true acting and screen writing clinic. We find ourselves anxious for the next Rudolph Abel scene during an extended span where the focus is on Donovan's negotiations. When the two finally reunite, it's a quietly affecting moment where much is said with few words.Spielberg utilized many of the locations where the actual events took place, and this includes Berlin and the Glienicke Bridge where the real exchange took place in 1962. While missing the labyrinth of twists and turns of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, it's knowing that these are real people in real situations that make this historic drama so thrilling and riveting to watch. Film lovers will also get a kick out of the fact that the script was co-written by the Coen Brothers, and history lovers will enjoy seeing some of the details provided by the written words of those involved, as well as their surviving family members. It's an era that seems so long ago, yet the topics are so pertinent to what's happening in the world today. Beyond all of that, it's a story of a man standing up for what's right at a time when that was not the easy or popular way.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","lee_eisenberg","7 December 2016","People in the 21st century might not be that familiar with the U-2 incident (a US spy plane got shot down over the Soviet Union and the pilot got arrested). If Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" is a good introduction. Indeed, one of the most important scenes is when Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) explains that he is defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) because the Constitution says that even the people charged with the most heinous crimes deserve equal protection under the law; this scene is just as relevant during the so called War on Terrorism, which is now likely to go supernova under a Trump presidency.But there was another side to the U-2 incident. Eisenhower was planning a summit with the leaders of the UK, France and the USSR, in the hope of easing Cold War tensions. The U-2 spy plane got shot down right before the summit was to take place, and the summit got canceled. It looks as though the plane got sent over the USSR to deliberately sabotage the summit, as the US hardliners didn't want an easing of Cold War tensions. This makes clear why Ike warned about the military industrial complex.A previous reviewer complained that the movie didn't emphasize things that were representative of the era, like cars or music. I interpreted the absence of these things to mean that this story is a timeless one, especially the matter of civil liberties in wartime.I'd say that Rylance deserved his Oscar win.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","amesmonde","3 June 2016","The bar association asks insurance lawyer James B. Donovan to defend a suspected Russian spy arrested on American soil. When an American spy is captured Donovan becomes a negotiator for two of the world powers to agree the prisoners release.With the film based on real-life events writers Matt Charman, Joel and Ethan Coen turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB into a tense and often humorous cat-and-mouse game. Suffering with a cold, quick thinking breifcase touting Tom Hanks' law-abiding lead character Donovan is gripping as he is used as a go between by his own government with German and Russian officials. Hanks brings an everyday man vulnerability, akin to Michael Caines' Harry Palmer to the role. Steven Spielberg offers a finely crafted Cold War espionage thriller, wonderfully recreating the Cold War era thanks to clever special effects. The stakes are high, you witness the Berlin Wall being built, it's an appealing diplomatic film. There are tense moments littered throughout, notably when Donovan is tasked in defending a Russian spy in a court of law, the backlash from his community and the danger he puts his family carries an impact.Its a fine production. Bridge of Spies is interesting throughout and it surprisingly captures some old fashion Hollywood magic.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","estebangonzalez10","27 October 2015","""This man, my father's friend, he was beaten. Every time they hit him, he stood back up again. They hit him harder, still he got back to his feet. I think because of this they let him live.""Over the past few years Steven Spielberg has shied away from the big blockbuster productions and settled for historical dramas such as Lincoln, War Horse, and Munich. Now we can add Bridge of Spies to Spielberg's list of history lessons which counts on some outstanding and understated performances from an A list cast. This is the fourth collaboration between Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and although it doesn't rank amongst my favorite I still enjoyed the character he plays here. Hanks is James B. Donovan, an insurance attorney with a strong sense of justice who also happens to be a respectable family man. Hanks plays the character very subtly and in a way he reminded me of Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch because both characters seem to share a strong moral code and they put their sense of justice above what the community might think of them. Here Donovan is given the task to serve as a defense attorney for a KGB intelligence officer named Rudolf Abel (played masterfully by Mark Rylance) during the height of the Cold War. You can imagine how the public reacts when Donovan begins to take his role seriously and defends this spy. It takes a toll on his family as well, his wife is played here by Amy Ryan and his children by Jillian Lebling, Noah Schnapps, and Eve Hewson. They believe in him, but also seem to be going through a similar conflict. My complaint here is that Amy Ryan is sidelined and doesn't get to play an important role in the movie. There is also a parallel story going on as several US pilots are being recruited on a special mission to secretly fly U2 planes over the Soviet Union to gather intel. One of these pilots is Francis Powers (Austin Stowell) who on his first mission is shot down and captured by the soviets. The two plots come together when Donovan is asked by US government officials to try to negotiate a deal to interchange their prisoners. Spielberg delivers a historical piece with precise attention to detail giving us once again another important lesson about humanity's unsung heroes. Donovan represents the ideal character here with strong moral values that are often forgotten or overlooked in today's movie. I couldn't think of a better actor to play such a character than the great Tom Hanks. However the standout for me was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. It was a breath of fresh air to see a character like this portrayed in such a humane light. He is not the enemy here, he is a man who is doing his job and also seems to share a strong moral code. Rylance gives the film's best performance and I think he out shined everyone in this film. The great Alan Alda also gets to be on screen for a few minutes although he isn't playing against type or anything like that. Political thrillers are rarely in my interest, but I couldn't let this film pass me by considering Steven Spielberg is the director who has made more of my favorite films than any other. Include a screenplay co-written with the Coen brothers and I was sold. The pacing of the film at times did seem to drag the movie down, but Spielberg treats the material with respect. Kaminski's cinematography captures the era perfectly and Newman's score adds to the emotional moments. The 50's are perfectly captured through the art direction and Spielberg managed to transport us back to Berlin during the construction of the wall. Overall I enjoyed my history lesson once again from Steven Spielberg, but I felt that the film could've benefited from more thrills and a better pacing. It's still a must see in my book. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","petra_ste","5 April 2016","This Cold War thriller confirms two things about director Steven Spielberg.First: he is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema. It's amazing how he makes every sequence visually interesting, fluid and well-paced, from dialogue scenes (which represent the bulk of Bridge of Spies) to action set-pieces (here just a brief plane crash). He gets strong performances from his actors, here Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, the latter in an Award-winning turn as a mild-mannered Soviet spy. The director's efficiency on set is legendary: Bridge of Spies looks great in spite of a slim (for Hollywood standards!) forty millions budget. Spielberg was just born to narrate stories...... and that's why his films, even the few I don't particularly like, as a general rule still have *something* worth recommending.Second: Spielberg's movies have diabetes. Sugar is sprinkled everywhere, peaking with sappy endings. Bridge of Spies would be greatly improved by radically altering or excising the last ten minutes... much like War of the Worlds, AI, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Minority Report. Looking back, it's surprising Spielberg delivered in Raiders of the Lost Ark one of the most memorably ironic epilogues ever.... and that's why I prefer Spielberg's more lighthearted films, like Jaws or Jurassic Park; in serious movies his fluffy endings feel more grating and inappropriate.Overall, Bridge of Spies is solid. The Coen brothers co-wrote the script, their touch shining through in several absurdist, humorous moments.7,5/10","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","jadepietro","26 October 2015","(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: A riveting docudrama with Spielberg and Hanks at the top of their gameGRADE: A-Bridge of Spies is a true Cold War tale about the espionage business, its unethical surveillance methods, and the ongoing political war games orchestrated between powerful nations. The film does shamelessly manipulate the emotions of its audience and, at times, lets the nostalgia wash over its subject matter depicting more innocent times than in actuality, but, in the capable hands of Steven Spielberg, this is superb filmmaking and one of the year's best. ￼ The director's masterful handling of this complex story impresses in its concise storytelling and richly drawn characters. The screenplay by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers builds its narrative convincingly and clearly lays its background exposition through its compelling dialog that not only establishes the characters and their motives but moves the action at a steady pace.The year is 1957 when the United States and Russia were major enemies and spies worked undercover in search of oneupmanship. (Some things never change.) Back then, the world was splintering into different political factions, the military industrial complex was expanding, the threat of nuclear retaliation was a common practice, and the Berlin Wall became a reality. (A few do.)￼Into this quagmire is yet another political incident involving a convicted Russian spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and an imprisoned American, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a pilot caught behind enemy lines. One man, a lawyer named James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked to act as a go-between and secretly negotiate their exchange. The film chronicles these events with authenticity and high drama.The acting is excellent and the film is very well cast. Mr. Hanks has played the similarly upright decent common man role before but he continually impresses with his restraint and understatement of a man with a moral code that will not waiver. The actor never allows his character to overplay the righteousness and make Donovan more complicated by his subtle acting choices. Mr. Rylance has the more showier role as Abel and he brings a sly and layered portrait of a man who seems to enjoy being the pawn in this chess match. Other standouts include Alan Alda as one of Donavan's associates, Dakin Matthews as a very biased judge, Jon Curry and Michael Gaston as determined CIA agents, Will Rogers as as idealistic college student caught in the cloak-and-dagger web of intrigue, and Amy Ryan as Donovan's loving 50's wife, white pearl necklace included.￼Production values are top notch. Janusz Kaminski's lovely muted photography, wonderful art direction designed by Adam Stockhausen, Kasia Walicka-Malmone's nuanced period costumes, and a subtle and haunting music score by the talented Thomas Newman all work to enhance this film. But it is Mr. Spielberg's vision that resonates. His love of period Americana and the late fifties era create powerful vignettes (e.g.: spectators in a courtroom rise segueing into students reciting the Pledge of Allegiance leading to a school lecture on the effects of radiation poisoning to highly impressionable children, desperate people trying to escape over the Berlin Wall and, moments later, seeing typical children playing and climbing over wire fences, reporters scurrying over broken discarded flashbulbs from old fashioned cameras that litter a courthouse corridor, a frightening aerial escape as a plane spins out of control. Special kudos to Michael Kahn for his skillful editing as well.) Spielberg's willingness to establish period details of pop culture images defines the film brilliantly.￼Bridge of Spies is a triumph and one of Mr. Spielberg's finest cinematic projects to date.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","swilliky","19 October 2015","I prepared myself for the slow and steady spy-craft of Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies and got to watch another strong performance from Tom Hanks.I was not familiar with this piece of history but apparently this insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan, had quite an effect on U.S. foreign negotiations during the Cold War. I can't help thinking there were some other stories to tell and should do some research on why Spielberg chose this particular story to adapt into a motion picture. There was certainly historical significance to the events depicted and I alway like to be made to think and to learn. It looked beautiful, shots, scenery, costumes, but I did notice it was just a bunch of white guys for the most part and a few minor roles for woman. I have been reading Hollywood has a problem with that but it's not like this movie set out to change that and I guess they were just displaying the times. There were also some great supporting performances by Mark Rylance, as Russian spy Rudolf Abel, and Amy Ryan, who played Donovan's wife and was also the mother in the recent Goosebumps movie. Someone should give her a leading role. I liked her all the way back in The Wire. Scott Shepherd was also good as a CIA agent.This movie hinges on Hanks performance and I had no doubt he would deliver. He especially excels in the final climactic scenes. I liked this movie but it was also a bit slow and doesn't necessarily need to be seen in theaters. This is the fourth collaboration between Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg after Saving Private Ryan (one of the greatest war movies ever), The Terminal (forgettable), and Catch Me If You Can (another great movie).

"Bridge of Spies","ClaytonDavis","5 October 2015","One of the most prolific directors in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg, returns to the silver screen with his new period thriller ""Bridge of Spies"" starring two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks. It features competent and solid filmmaking from its director, writers, and crafts team however, the film doesn't quite ignite passion and excitement from its standard storytelling. What really manages to standout is the impeccable and sensational performance of Emmy Award nominee Mark Rylance, who steals and owns every scene he's present.The film tells the story of James Donovan (Hanks), an American lawyer that is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. It all begins with the discovery of a probable spy on our own soil Rudolf Abel (Rylance), who tests Donovan's profession and safety net.Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg brings many of his signature techniques to the spy tale. Tugging at the emotional heartstrings is an Olympic event at this juncture in his career, although not exactly hitting the mark the way it was intended. He frames his scenes with the same familiar authority that we've grown to love about Spielberg, and it definitely exceeds some of his lesser works like ""War Horse"" and ""The Terminal."" What the film truly lacks is a daring approach to its source material. Unfamiliar with the story and real life individuals, Spielberg, and the writers, Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman, don't enter the grit and horror of two countries at a feud, literally on the brink of a real devastating war.Tom Hanks brings his natural charisma and wit that we've loved about him for decades. His James Donovan is caring, engaging, and reminiscent of Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" His devotion to his family and the human condition is truly admirable, all clear and on display thanks to Hanks. As Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance is just a joy to behold, filling in the gaps of the film's shortcomings with charm and seasoned acting ability. It's a brilliant turn by a brilliant actor. It's one of the year's best supporting turns and a contender for the Oscar statue.As James' wife Mary, Amy Ryan is relegated to just a few scenes but great nonetheless. Also brief are the works of Billy Magnussen and Alan Alda, who have good, solid one scenes to chew on.Technically the film does present qualms. Janusz Kaminski's camera work is distracting in parts, shining bright lights through windows, and keeping a one note camera style all throughout its 135 minute run time. Thomas Newman's score isn't put to its best use, as it swells in inopportune moments, even managing to overwhelm a key and fantastic scene by Rylance. Michael Kahn cuts the film to a bloated expansive run time but manages to keep you involved enough to make it through. The film really shines in its Production Design by Adam Stockhausen and its Costume work by Kasia Walicka-Maimone.""Bridge of Spies"" may find lovers in mass audiences. What it does well is ignite a curiosity and power to look at the history of its subject. Spielberg succeeds at introducing the world to James Donovan and what else he contributed to society, along with the supporting players at hand. We do wish that a better, more dynamic treatment had hit the screens. From an awards standpoint, it's going to appeal to a great deal. Perhaps a second viewing will open up more possibilities.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","LW-08854","23 December 2023","The film is very dialogue heavy, with great production design, well lit, expertly directed and filmed, a little humour mixed into the script, plus a brilliant performance by Mark Rylance. Both the script and the style of the film felt very old Hollywood to me, there's a strong focus on characters and carefully written dialogue rather than showy melodrama and to make clear that Mark Rylance is not playing the bad guy in the film his position is contrasted with an American captured by the USSR on similar spy charges. The characterization of Rylance's character also leads the audience towards sympathy with him, his mild manner and honest persona win not just his lawyer over but the wider audience.In terms of suitability for children I'd say it's fine, though they might find it a bit slow in parts, There's little violence and when it does happen it's nothing up close or graphic, though the mood is tense throughout. Some of the direction is slightly clunky and on the nose, but overall I think there's much to enjoy. The CGI is not great.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","writers_reign","28 November 2015","This could almost be subtitled To Kill A Nightingale for what we have is no less than Tom Hanks as Atticus Finch, the ultra respectable lawyer and seemingly the only one who can be approached to defend a no-hoper in the shape of Mark Rylance, honorary Black man and, as a Russian spy in the in the heart of the Cold War as persona non grata in New York as Tom Robinson in 1930s Alabama. In a further touch of irony Gregory Peck, the personification of Atticus Finch, would have arguably been first choice to play Donovan had he still been available but Tom Hanks who, to some extent, plays Gregory Peck good-guy roles for a living, makes a creditable pinch- hitter. Whereas Atticus Finch was a fictional recreation of Harper Lee's lawyer father Donovan was a real person as was Francis Gary Powers, the pilot shot down in Russian air space who declined to kill himself rather than be captured. As comedian Mort Sahl said at the time, there have been two traitors in US history, the first was Nathan Hale who said 'I regret I have but one life to give for my country', the second was Francis Gary Powers, who said, 'this shatters all my plans'. Donovan is, of course, unable to secure a not guilty verdict for his client but he does prevail upon the court to spare him execution on the grounds that he may prove useful as a pawn in some future negotiation and when Powers is captured he is able to broker an exchange. Both Hanks and Mark Rylance turn in fine performances and for a cerebral rather than action-filled thriller the film is a success.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","evanston_dad","15 April 2016","I thought that the Coen brothers as co-screenwriters of ""Bridge of Spies"" meant that we might get some restraint and intelligence to balance the maudlin platitudes that almost certainly come attached with a Steven Spielberg film. But I was wrong. Spielberg takes a chilly Cold War setting and then proceeds to pump sentimentality into it until by the end it's as sunny and warm as a Folgers coffee commercial.Tom Hanks, as usual, does his best to calm Spielberg down, and plays the main character as an every man Joe trying to do the right thing despite Spielberg's attempts to cram his heroics down our throats. But by the film's end, he's as overwhelmed by the rest of us by Spielberg's schmaltz, served with healthy doses of the requisite pounding Spielbergian score, this one supplied not by John Williams but rather by Thomas Newman.Mark Rylance won an Oscar for playing a Russian spy who barely speaks, and I suppose I appreciated his ability to convey emotions without histrionics, something Spielberg certainly isn't capable of. But I can't say I really see that he did anything special enough to warrant an Academy Award.The Coens were nominated for their script, which they co-wrote with Matt Charman, and the film also copped nominations for Best Picture, Production Design, Original Score, and Sound Mixing.Grade: B-","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","RforFilm","27 October 2015","As a child who grew up during the late nineties through the mid 2000's, I was part of the first generation to be raised in an era where there wasn't a second great power on Earth. Being born in 1987, I was living within the Cold War for only a few years, during the last moments of an interesting generation for America; a generation that once thought that a third World War with the Soviets was possible and that any day could be the last before the bomb was dropped. It was the last of an era were today's movie perfectly says was a war of information.Given how many WWII movies are out there, I'm surprised that nostalgia and our obsession with history has not produced more movies about the Cold War. Though there are plenty before the Soviet Union was dissolved (Including Dr. Strangelove, Rocky IV and my favorite of the bunch, WarGames), you'd think that more stories about the era would have opened up allowing for plenty of entertaining options. Steven Spielberg is a director that has tackled WWII plenty of times (1941, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), so Bridge of Spies should seem like a literal and figurative bridge to connect that transition. In 1957 Brooklyn, a middle-aged painter Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) is seen picking up a secret message and reads it before FBI agents burst into his apartment. He's arrested and prosecuted as a Soviet spy, sparking a media and public demand for his death. As per rule by the court, Rudolf is given a lawyer for his defense, which turns out to be James B. Donovan (played by Tom Hanks). The interesting thing is that James is an insurance lawyer with little experience in criminal law, but takes the case anyway to show that he's loyal to his profession.James receive hate mail and accusations from people, his own children and even get's approached by the CIA, but stands on his ground that he's simply doing his job, helping the soviet spy. Though Rudolf is found guilty, James convinces the judge the give a jail sentence rather then death in case of needed collateral. That moment comes soon enough when CIA agent Francis Gary Powers is shot down and jailed by the Soviets. Both governments agree to an exchange, but not only does James actually have to go to East Germany to negotiate the deal, but when another American is jailed, he tries to get a two for one prisoner.Steven Spielberg has a track record that's easy to rely to when defending his movies, yet I wasn't sure how I'd respond to the political-legal thriller that Bridge of Spies is. I'm proud to say that it s engaging in a most unexpected way. While the subject doesn't seem too remarkable, once you get to know both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance's (who I hope gets an awards nomination for his portrayal) character, you get a good idea of what both sides are hoping to achieve, both as a stance on what it means to be loyal to your country and doing what's right.Aside from being a strong character piece, Bridge of Spies has a different look then you might expect from the more whimsical Spielberg. This fits right along his darker material as most of the movie is shown is greyer tones and surprisingly gets greyer once the story shifts to East Germany. With that said, the recreation of a Cold War Berlin looks great, especially when you see Tom Hanks riding the train to the other side where the wall shows what the difference is in one moment (which I won't give away).I'll give this ten cold war posters out of ten. Bridge of Spies is guaranteed one of my favorite movies of 2015 and deserves at least one watch from not just cold war fanatics or even history fanatics, but from the mainstream crowd. Bridge of Spies will get least start one conversation going once the end credits roll.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","neil-476","27 November 2015","It is 1957, and commercial lawyer James Donovan is required to defend spy Rudolf Abel, which he does (unsuccessfully). When US spy pilot Gary Powers is shot down by the Russians, Donovan is called upon to negotiate an exchange, into which he factors US student Frederic Pryor in a 2-for-1 exchange. But Powers is held by the Russians and Pror is held by the East Germans, and they don't have the same agendas.Steven Spielberg picks up the hidden parts of a story which had disappeared under the headline value of Gary Powers Shot Down, and it turns out to be quite a small story, but displayed on a big canvas (the painting metaphor is apt, as Abel's painting forms part of the film's narrative). The film conjures up its era very well – the comfort of 1950s USA vs the grim drabness of Berlin, the USA paranoia over the red menace, the communist paranoia over everything. And, among the efficient and effective telling of the story (aided by a script touch-up from the Coen brothers), there are the usual Spielbergian directorial flourishes, primarily some wonderful moving camera shots. This is not an attractive film – post-war Berlin was not an attractive city – but it is never less than rewarding to watch.Tom Hanks does a sterling job as the deceptively mild but steely Donovan, and Mark Rylance's Abel is similar to his Thomas Cromwell: a watcher and a listener, with quiet depths.This is not a film full of bluster and bombast, but it is an impressive and gripping movie.","8/10"

"Bridge of Spies","StevePulaski","19 October 2015","Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" opens in a quiet, almost meditative manner, giving us a sense of the hustle in 1957 Brooklyn during the brutal Cold War. Spielberg focuses on movements of characters and slow, melodic buildup that results in a shockingly peaceful opening, giving what we can foresee will occur. We then cut to a man named Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), who retrieves a secret message in public before he returns to his apartment to be apprehended by FBI agents believing he is a Soviet spy.Subsequently, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), a lawyer who specializes in insurance settlements, is requested to take the case and serve as Abel's defense. The difficultly in the forthcoming legal battle is to ensure that Abel gets a fair trial, despite relations with Russian boiling like an unattended pot on a hot stove. Also during this time is the famous U-2 incident, where an American spy plane was shot down by Soviets and resulted in the death of Pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). As a result, Donovan must now go to the USSR in order to try and sanction an exchange for Abel's safe return to his homeland for Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), an economics professor who was arrested under suspicion of being a spy during the construction of the Berlin Wall.The first half of ""Bridge of Spies"" is so quiet and low-key that it's almost a marvel of some sort. Spielberg further proves himself to be a delicate artist, with a gentle, liberal hand for long takes and intimate settings that build relationships with characters through tight, formal structures. Working with his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, Spielberg gives this film a classic-film look, almost echoing the dark and brooding sentiments of Hanks' overlooked ""Road to Perdition."" This film feels like a Cold War-era film about a forgotten piece of the era, thanks to its emphasis on classic set decoration and Spielberg's directorial artistry.The second half of ""Bridge of Spies,"" however, opts for an approach more grounded in what you'd expect from this kind of a film: talky setups, moral conveniences, and a more linear A-to-B plot structure instead of the fascinating ambiguity and meditative qualities a Spielberg film like ""Lincoln"" or ""Munich"" maintained throughout their entire runtimes. During this latter half of the film - which admittedly doesn't cripple it - even with the film's scope extended to a more international level, we still zero in on the fine performance by Tom Hanks, who further proves that pairing him with Spielberg can almost do no wrong.Hanks plays a character conflicted because of oppressive times to the point where some may find it difficult to see ""the big deal"" behind defending a Soviet spy on American soil. The moral ideas about following through with due process and a fair trial, while pretty standard and predictable for anyone who paid attention in law class, is still nonetheless a fascinating depiction of a film that is erected on difficult, weighty decisions by characters that always come with an accompanied ""but..."" whenever they are audibly proposed. Probably the most underrated component of the film, however, is the relationship Hanks' Donovan has with Rylance's Abel. The two occupy a sort of respectful, father/son relationship with one another that makes their banter that much more believable, in addition to softly humorous in some respect. The film would've benefited from more of these simple scenes between two men caught in very difficult positions where a rulebook of any kind eludes them.The film was co-written by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, and in some ways, the more somber style of filmmaking makes this feel more like a Coen spectacle than a Spielberg film. However, it's the poetry communicated through Spielberg's directing that makes the film feel so fluid, in addition to the strong narrative that is given time to build over the course of nearly two and a half hours. All of these elements blended with some great, subtle period cinematography and a strong Hanks performance and you have a fascinating adult drama that, while not as layered as it could be, is an enriching experience.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","jamieleeackerman","18 January 2016","With the masterful Steven Spielberg behind the lens, this movie was destined to be amazing. Tom Hanks gave an incredible performance as the non-fictional character, James B. Donovan. I really enjoyed this film because of that aspect; that it really happened. It was such an eye opening film to a true story I never really knew about it. Hanks was an extremely powerful and convincing lawyer and it was very interesting to see how his mind worked when it came to dealing with the character Rudolf Abel, played by Mark Rylance. Rylance also delivered a wonderful performance. Overall, this film was an interesting insight to events during the Cold War and a story that definitely needed to be told.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Robert_duder","9 December 2015","Bridge of Spies had two things going for it that I thought for sure would make it a hit in my books. You have Tom Hanks and you have Steven Spielberg. How can you go wrong? Probably one of the greatest actors known to us and one of the greatest directors. Bridge of Spies is a fascinating story, well acted, definitely saved from oblivion by the intense talent of the two aforementioned men. However, the pacing of the film is definitively off. It feels slow and it is slow. It is almost cumbersome to try and pay attention. There just feels like there is something missing that makes it more captivating and I think professional critics will agree with me and Bridge of Spies won't make a splash at all. Now all that said, there is no doubt you can see Spielberg's masterful eye and vision in many shots. The film is, at times, a cinematographic masterpiece. Visually amazing scenes of Berlin during the wall being put up and the horrifyingly powerful scene of Hanks watching people desperately trying to get over the wall. The bleak coldness of Berlin at the time (although apparently the wrong time of year for the real story - it worked well for dramatization purposes.) Tom Hanks...the man, the legend...a living icon of Hollywood. He produces and writes and acts and gets awards and he has had an incredible career. He is just charismatic on screen and he becomes every character he portrays and this performance is no exception. His portrayal is passionate and the character well established. Hanks does what he does best. Mark Rylance is getting a lot of buzz for his performance as Russian spy Rudolf Abel and certainly he does a good job in a sort of understated and subtle way. His role isn't very big but it is effective and he and Hanks are great together. It's a very fascinating relationship. The supporting cast are all good but the film definitely focuses heavily on Hanks' character so they get small roles. Amy Ryan, Austin Stowell, Dakin Matthews, Sebastian Koch and Burghart Klaußner are a few of the better supporting performances in the film.Saying anything about Steven Spielberg's direction is literally pointless. The man is a master and a visionary and as I mentioned you can definitely his expert mastery in the film. The only issue perhaps is that someone who is editing or producing his films might be reluctant to be honest about potential issues. Bridge of Spies goes on too long and stumbles in several respects and even misses some key things that could have made the story more interesting. Still, it has it's appeal but considering Hanks and Spielberg's involvement at the head it is forgettable in its genre and that's simply unfortunate. I sort of had high expectations for good reason it only delivered on a very slight level. Worth watching once but don't expect a Saving Private Ryan or a Schindler's List but poor man's version of either of those. 7/10","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Mike_Devine","29 July 2021","As with most Steven Spielberg films, 'Bridge of Spies' was a shoe-in for a best picture nomination at the 2016 Academy Awards. Wartime setting? Check. International relations-infused drama based on true events? Check. Tom Hanks? Of course - check.Despite the formulaic nature of 'Spies,' the film is unsurprisingly as well done as most things Spielberg touches. He has a way with turning something that could be very straightforward on paper into a story that tugs at the heartstrings while making several twists and turns. Here, we see a bond develop between Hanks's virtuous Brooklyn lawyer and an alleged Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in a tangled web of deceit, wargames and trickery that defined this era. There's a cold and dark undertone to the film, which matches the harsh elements on screen, but Hanks's James Donovan is a lighthouse in his crusade for justice.But it's not just the acting that stands out here. The execution of 'Spies' is something to take note of, from the use of visual call-backs throughout the film like the images of people jumping the Berlin wall and backyard fences to the refrain of Rylance's question ""Would it help?"" in response to multiple statements Hanks makes, these serve as Spielberg's fingerprints on his product.'Bridge of Spies' is not the most memorable film from this genre. Instead, it's an understated story of personal achievement that is happy to exist as a snapshot of a moment in time from a contentious period in our history.","4/10"
"Bridge of Spies","jdring2007","9 June 2021","I'll preface this review by saying this is NOT my typical movie. But, I've been on a Spielberg binge and I do like educating myself. However it seemed that anything the Coen Brothers write gets praised; I'm ambivalent about this. Here, the script often felt forced and theatrical, despite the solemn subject matter. The movie, at its best, is powerful, but only subtly. Long and slow, with very little tension, it felt more like a documentary than a ""suspense drama,"" and absolutely not a ""thriller."" The Bay of Pigs negotiations mentioned at the end of the movie would have seemed like a much better and more inspiring movie. Nonetheless, performances were on par with the actors casted, although nothing above and beyond.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","bankofmarquis","24 October 2015","Sometimes, you go to the Cineplex to ""catch a flick"". Sometimes, you go to ""watch a movie"". And sometimes, if you're lucky, you are able to ""view a film"".BRIDGE OF SPIES is a film in every sense of the word.Directed by the great Steven Spielberg, BRIDGE OF SPIES tells the story of the Cold War prisoner exchange in the early 1960's that was brokered by the character portrayed by Tom Hanks . Taking his time telling this story in a script that was written by Matt Charman and punched up the the Coen brothers, Spielberg and Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski create a gray, grainy and, yes, cold world that accurately depicts the feelings of the time.Not only is Spielberg at the top of his game but so is Hanks in the lead role. He imbues lawyer James Donovan with strength courage and decency while also showing the fear of the unknown that permeates the movie and the Cold War times of the early '60's. It is Hanks best performance in quite some time and further cements him as one of the best actors of our generation.Spielberg, Hanks, Kaminski, Coen are all ""veteran"" movie names that show, yet again, that they know what they are doing and create a film/world that is interesting to look at and satisfying to experience. But it is relative film newcomer Mark Rylance, as Russian spy Rudolf Abel who steals the show. This veteran theater actor has a minimalist expressive face that shows more emotion in a raised eyebrow than most actors show in the entire performances. It is a memorable performance and one that I expect to see called out come Academy Awards time.If you are looking for an ""action"" spy movie - wait for the James Bond film that is coming out in a few weeks. If you are looking for a smart, atmospheric, well acted FILM that accurately depicts the mood, feeling and atmosphere of the Cold War, view BRIDGE OF SPIES.It's terrific.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","leplatypus","31 December 2016","The 1st thing I noticed is that even Spielberg has turned into this blue/orange grading so that's the proof that things have really turn bad! But his Kaminsky knows at least to compose with lights and for some really brief moments, I thought I was back into the X-files! Next, this movie is clearly divided into 2 parts: the one in US about the trial of the soviet spy and the other in Berlin about the exchange. The 1st one is the best as in Munich, Amistad and Lincoln, Spielberg defends justice for all and punches the security pretext! However, the 2nd part is just awful, filled with candid sugar (Hanks is also responsible) and totally unbelievable! In addition, the movie is much too long because of a lot of useless scenes (U2 mission, the detention, ). At the end, Spielberg is really far of his best: he proves one more time that he is very fragile on political movies but at least, he did them and he has found a great old actor with the soviet spy.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","jaysanchu07","28 March 2022","Bridge of Spies is a well crafted film that tells an important yet unnoticed story on the Cold War. Don't expect guns blazing and pistol whipping action however, as Steven Spielberg's picture keeps away from the frontlines & focuses on the talking points of governments at war. In the film, we see James Donovan, an insurance lawyer roped into representing a Soviet spy, who is later promoted as a negotiator for the exchange of American POWs held captive by the Commies.As a film that relies heavily on directing, dialogue & acting, BoS delivers. Spielberg showcases masterful camerawork, adding thrill & emotions through well timed close ups and character placement in long takes. This compliments very well with the crackling script stamped by the Coen brothers. As for our stars, Tom Hanks gives another Oscar worthy performance as his dramatization of intense and colorful moments was captivating. Thanks to his satisfying performance, I was blindsided with how un-dull the film was specially for a ""talking"" film. Mark Rylance was just as impressive! His delivery of the restrained and unnerved Soviet mole takes an unsympathetic character & turns it into one of the years 's memorable movie creations.Overall, I would give this film an 8/10 and further props for its old school Hollywood traits in filmmaking.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","kmonk-67893","10 December 2015","How Steven Spielberg went from the king of summer thrills to the most boring director in Hollywood is a problem that's perplexed me since I pried my eyes open through Lincoln.We all know the man can make a great movie. Most of us grew up on a diet of E.T., Jaws and Indiana Jones: spectacular event films with all the entertainment oomph of a theme park roller coaster.Then, Spielberg hit middle age and wanted to make important films for grown-ups. He made Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Munich, but he also made Minority Report, A.I and War of the Worlds – pretty decent action films with big star power.It looked like Spielberg had come of age with a sharpened skill set and a slightly deeper world view, but the more high-brow Spielberg gets, the duller his movies become...Inspired by real life events, and apparently a footnote in a JFK biography, Bridge of Spies tells the story of an insurance attorney named James Donovan. A mild-mannered family man plucked from a Norman Rockwell painting, Donovan is as American as the flag itself – and it's a trait he waves at every opportunity, from gratuitous speeches about the American Constitution to his acceptance of a case he is destined to lose.In the opening act, we watch an older man (Mark Rylance) take his easel on the subway, sit in the park and paint, and very carefully remove a fake nickel from the underside of a park bench. The nickel is hollow, and written on a tiny piece of paper within, is a series of codes.The man's name is Rudolf Abel, and he's arrested for treason and espionage just a few moments later. Given the year is 1957, Abel's fate looks bleak. The Rosenbergs were executed just four years earlier after being convicted of similar charges, and Abel refuses to cooperate with the CIA, making him delectably disposable.These days, he'd probably just disappear, but back then, America still believed its own propaganda and the notion of due process. It must appear as if Abel is getting a fair and just trial, which is where James Donovan comes in... It feels a little like a greatest hits album, but the scenes with Mark Rylance have real pop. The two men have an interesting dynamic as ideological warriors who landed on different sides of the battlefield, and it's the only part of the film that has any real traction because everyone else is locked in a freezer of Cold War archetype.Spielberg capitalizes on the common ground, offering up timely and inspirational rhetoric concerning the importance of due process, Constitutional rights and freedoms, and the American way, but like Lincoln, the big speeches have all the subtlety of a Broadway musical...Abridged from Ex.Press.com","7/10"

"Bridge of Spies","howard.schumann","29 November 2015","The height of the Cold War, the late 1950s, was a time of anti-Communist hysteria fueled by Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist crusade and only four years after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted and executed for providing atomic secrets to the Russians. While it may seem anachronistic to make a film about the Cold War, the points made in Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies are just as relevant today. Like Spielberg's Lincoln, it is a film about values, about standing up for what you know to be right instead of succumbing to your fears, not an examination of the rights and wrongs of international intrigue or the merits or demerits of the Cold War. Co-written by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman, insurance lawyer James Donovan, (Tom Hanks), is called upon by his boss (Alan Alda) to defend Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a defense that would thwart a public opinion calling for his summary execution. In attempting to mount a defense, Donovan discovers that the government only wants him to go through the motions of due process, not to actually mount a strong case for his acquittal. Not even Donovan's family wants him to defend Abel, especially after they receive death threats and rocks are thrown through the windows. In the film's opening sequence, Abel is seen painting a self-portrait in a room filled with receivers and transmitters when he is interrupted by a phone call. Leaving his building, he is pursued by federal agents in a frantic chase through streets and subways tracked by cinematographer Janusz Kaminsky. When captured in his home by the feds, the taciturn Abel in a breakout performance by Shakespearean actor Rylance maintains his calm and denies that he is a spy. All he can say is to ask that the agent to please fetch his teeth from the bathroom. Un-Communist spy-like, Abel is also given to dry humor. When asked why he is so calm in the face of possible execution, he replies, ""Would it help?"" a response that is humorous and appropriate but repeated once too often in the film to maintain its edge. Though aware of the strong evidence of his client's guilt, Donovan establishes a good relationship with Abel whom he calls a man of integrity who is only serving his country. The first part of the film depicts the court proceedings, the sentencing, and Donovan's appeal to the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds, an appeal that he lost on a 5-4 decision. The bulk of the film, however, takes place in Berlin where it turns into an international spy thriller, and a good one at that. The film shows the CIA's secret U2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) flying at 70,000 feet en route to Russia to photograph military installations when it is shot down over Russian air space. When Powers disobeys instructions from his superiors to go down with the plane and is captured by the Russians where he is imprisoned and tortured, the event torpedoes the summit meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, dashing the world's hopes for peace. Spielberg does not hold back from showing the techniques that Powers is forced to undergo, perhaps a reference to the CIA's use of water-boarding during the Iraq War. Called upon to negotiate a prisoner exchange between the Soviets and the East Germans of Powers and captured American student Frederic L. Pryor (Will Rogers) for Abel, Donovan is mugged by East German punks and stripped of his overcoat in the freezing snow, suggesting the addition of ""The Spy Who Got a Cold"" to the film's title. Anyway, coat or no coat, Donovan must maintain the ruse that he is an independent party, not an official government representative and the back and forth intrigue and chess match of opposing wills ratchets up the tension until its dramatic conclusion. Bridge of Spies strives for and achieves a refreshing balance, not gratingly pro-American or excessively anti-Soviet but a film that demonstrates the sordid nature of espionage on both sides. I could complain about the unnecessary role played by Amy Ryan as Donovan's devoted wife, the ending that goes on past the film's logical dramatic stopping point, or the overwrought score by Thomas Newman, but would it help? The film is best when it makes clear what American values are supposed to be about. Donovan's argument to the Supreme Court expresses this well. ""Abel is an alien charged with the capital offense of Soviet espionage,"" he said. ""It may seem anomalous that our Constitutional guarantees protect such a man.  Yet our principles are engraved in the history and the law of the land. If the free world is not faithful to its own moral code, there remains no society for which others may hunger."" Amen, brother!","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","blanbrn","17 October 2015","""Bridge of Spies"" is a thriller starring Tom Hanks that was set during the Cold War times which involved a rescue mission of a Soviet spy.

Not so easy to do walking around a recently-bricked up city of East Berlin. STASI (East-German nasty secret police) and the KGB were ruthless & unpredictable.Hanks portrays a firm, but fair man in an under-stated but convincing manner.

"Bridge of Spies","paul-allaer","17 October 2015","""Bridge of Spies"" (2015 release; 141 min.) brings the story of how insurance lawyer Jim Donovan became involved in negotiating a prisoner exchange in Berlin between the US and the USSR. As the movie opens, we are told that it is ""1957, the height of the cold war"". We then follow someone in Brooklyn, who after a long chase sequence gets arrested for spying for the Russians. In order to make it look like the spy is getting due process and a ""fair shake"", the US government appoints a lawyer to represent him. Turns out to be NY insurance lawyer (and ex-Nurnberg assistant prosecutor) Jim Donovan. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest in series of historical ""inspired by true events"" movies from director Steven Spielberg, this time directing from a script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen (yes, THE Coen brothers). I had seen the trailer a number of times, and was expecting a riveting movie in line with earlier historical movies from Spielberg such as Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Munich. Alas, it was not to be. The movie lacks any tension whatsoever, and has the feeling of having been done strictly ""by the numbers"". The best scenes are when we get to Berlin, in the frantic days as the wall was being completed and people were desperate to get out of East Berlin. And the of course the climax of the movie, filmed on the real bridge of spies (the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, near Potsdam--I had the good fortune of visiting this site a few years ago, it gave me the chills walking on it). There are several noteworthy acting performances: Tom Hanks (in his 4th cooperation with Spielberg) as Jim Donovan, and Mark Rylance as the spy Rudolf Abel (great line: Donovan: ""you're not worried?"", to which Abel responds: ""would it help?"", ha!). As always with Spielberg, the production is terrific and authentic in to the smallest of details. Last but certainly not least: the orchestral score is, shockingly, NOT by John Williams, which I believe marks the first time in 40 years in a Steven Spielberg (the score is from Thomas Newman, who does a fine job). Bottom lime: I found ""Bridge of Spies"" strangely subdued and to me it feels like Spielberg played it safe in this one.""Bridge of Spies"" opened nationwide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, but frankly I had expected a lot more people, given this is the movie's opening weekend. I have seen most of Spielberg's movies and as a long-time fan, must admit this to me feels like one of the weaker movies he's done in a long time. Is it bad? Of course not, but neither is it great. Nevertheless, this is of course a personal and subjective view, and I would encourage you to check out ""Bridge of Spies"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.","7/10"

It depicts the story of a Mr Abel (Mark Rylance), captured and accused of being a spy during he 1950's at the heart of the cold war between the US and Russia. Tom Hanks plays the Lawyer Jack Donovan who is offered the task of defending Mr Abel.Hanks does more than that, delivering a heartwarming portrayal of a good man who just wants to do good. After defending Abel and fighting for his survival, the US continues it's spying actions over Russia. Hanks is eventually asked to take a role that will challenge his nerves, his family, and his belief in all he believes in. Will he succeed in this role, or will he suffer the same horrible fate as so many East Germans?I really liked Bridge of Spies. The direction by Spielberg was excellent. The costume and scenery were great - really authentic. Hanks was terrific, and Rylance was good, though I think Rocky in Creed should have won the Academy Award.

This didn't really interest me. Something of interest - a bit of action maybe, or intrigue - only happened every now and again; few and far between.There's no denying this is a well made film.

"Bridge of Spies","jaimegonzales210","12 January 2016","I guess the point of the movie was to demonstrate that Americans are over-reactive, unfair and hateful. From childhood, apparently, Americans learn to be bad people who grow up to be worse people. Any enemies we have must be good people. Never mind that there were Russian spies in America, they are portrayed as the ""good guys"" here. Americans were bad for a.) catching Russian spies and b.) engaging in the same espionage Russia was engaging in.A common theme among Hollywood stories seems to be that everyone but Americans are the good guys, yet Hollywood still has not relocated to the Palestine territories. Curious. It seems somewhat ironic to me that they benefit from capitalism while making movies about how actually evil capitalists are, then give themselves awards for half a year. Nobody I know makes $42 million for 24 days of filming, but somehow the person that does is more virtuous than my neighbor, who retired from law enforcement. He thinks America is a great place to live.","10/10"

Like more of Spielbergs more recent films this is more of a dialogue driven drama and it's not discredit to him his films all have amazing dialogue and this is no different it makes for a compelling film that any Spielberg fan should watch. Tom Hanks in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg is fantastic in this film he's impossible not to get behind he just knows how to portray the every man quality of his character that just wants to do the right thing and that's what makes James Donovan such a great protagonist for this film he just wants to do the right thing despite all the hatred it brings him. But ultimately movie new comer Mark Ryalnce stole this movie and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for it he has amazing chemistry with Hanks. Ryalnce just brings a likability and vulnerability to him and his ""Standing Man"" scene will go down as one of the great movie scenes in a Spielberg movie. The courtroom scenes in this movie really gave you a sense of how people were during this time and gives you a chance to see what Donovan and Abel were facing for what they were trying to do. The flaws from this film though come from its second half the plot to free Powers just wasn't neither as compelling as the plot to free Abel and I would have personally would have portrayed his character more like James Ryan from another Spielberg film ""Saving Private Ryan"" it just would have made us more excited to finally see him and would have made for a more compelling story arc.But in the end I like Bridge of Spies much more than I ever thought I would it has fantastic dialogue, characters and performances making for one of the finest films of 2015. 88%-A-","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","imdb-45","29 November 2015","With all the power names in this film it has all the potential to be one of the greatest. And sadly, this watchable and reasonably entertaining film falls incredibly flat on many accounts if you're someone who uses your brain. When a film relies upon a character study and doesn't have lots of action, there needs to be a proper foundation to justify why characters act the way they do - and that clearly wasn't the case here. And the film's attempt to be clever outsmarts itself.In summary, Hanks plays an insurance defense lawyer. He's recruited to be the face of a defense for an alleged Russian spy. The full details of the spy are unfortunately just left for the viewers imagination. There is a complete lack of developing the character other than ""a dispassionate old guy who likes to paint and look like a nice old man"" that Tom Hanks finds his heart bleeding after a meeting. There seems no question that the man is guilty. But Tom Hanks decides to go all the way to defend this man and beyond, in spite of being demonized in public as the defender of a traitor. Things get complicated when a US pilot is captured in Russia and an innocent American student as well in Germany.The performances are excellent. There is some witty dialogue and some character study, unquestionably the unrivaled abilities of the Coen brothers. I found the first 1/3 of the film to be the most engaging, by far.But as much as I admire their work, this film has Spielberg shmaltz draped all over it. And this ultimately is what makes this film (a) totally predictable; and (b) overly dramatic to the point of groaning multiple times. I found myself drawn completely outside of the movie when it was clear that these actors were just caricatures and very shallow, cardboard cutouts. The film was cardboard, mostly telling a noble series of events without knowing very much at all about all of the players. There is precious little to understand the true motives of any of the characters. And then there will be repeated one-liners for laughs (I thought the characters would wink at the screen) and moments where you could practically hear the director call for the camera to pan out and admire the actor, transfixed in his expression which makes a bold, iconic statement. (Yeah, I'm guessing it all went down just like that, a dramatic artistic moment.) It's an entertaining film but make no mistake before you decided to go -- this has Hollywood draped all over what you would not expect from a Coen Brothers script. If you can shut down your brain and cheer for American patriotism, you'll very much enjoy the film. But if you're a thinking person who picks up on subtle cues, you may find this a very contrived and predictable work.","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","rogerdarlington","30 November 2015","A thriller co-authored by Joel and Ethan Coen, directed by Steven Spielberg and, starring Tom Hanks promises much - and fortunately ""Bridge Of Spies"" delivers. For all this super-talent, what gives the movie such power is the compelling story which is largely inspired by true events. At the height of the Cold War in 1962, an insurance lawyer called James Donovan (Hanks) - without any specific status or authority and suffering from a head cold during the key negotiations - managed to facilitate a spy swap. In return for downed U2 pilot Gary Powers, (and an unfortunate American student detained in East Berlin), the Americans agreed to hand over convicted Soviet KGB spy Rudolf Abel, the physical exchange of the actual spies taking place on Glienicke Bridge (hence the title of the movie echoing that other bridge in Venice).This is a great role for Hanks who plays the kind of decent American that is rare in the movies these days, an amicable lawyer who is willing to offer Abel a legal defence and gives a CIA operative a mini-lecture on the need to honour ""the rule book"" that is the US Constitution. In effect, Donovan is the bridge between Abel and Powers and the film cleverly tells the spies'stories in parallel - two dedicated state servants who become lonely prisoners whose only physical connection is a few seconds passing one another on a snowy bridge without a word exchanged between them. Abel is played by the outstanding British actor Mark Rylance who, as he did in his portrayal of Thomas Cromwell on BBC television, ushers a laconic, wry and understated persona (although his accent rather wanders).It is a tribute to the sharp (and sometimes amusing) script - co-authored by British dramatist Matt Charmian - that, although we know how the mission will end, it is still a gripping tale. Thanks to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, the film looks good with a lot of attention to period detail, but there are a couple of contemporary political messages here. The first is clear: in the face of a war (whether the cold war or the war on terror), we should not abandon our ""rulebook"" (that is, our protection of liberty). The other message might be unintentional: just as the East Germans build a wall and fortifications to prevent their citizens from seeking freedom and prosperity in the West, so Europe today - but notably not Germany itself - is erecting fences to present Syrian and other refugees from their efforts to flee another form of totalitarian rule.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","tavm","26 May 2016","I finally watched this Steven Spielberg-directed drama starring Tom Hanks on Netflix disc with my mom just now. We were both enthralled by this based on a true story of Hanks' James Donovan-an insurance lawyer who previously was involved in the Nuremberg trials-and his attempt to first defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance who gave a performance worthy of his Oscar win) and then fostering an exchange with Russia and East Germany to trade Abel for pilot Francis Gary Powers and student Frederic Pryor, respectively. It was fascinating finding out later how much of the movie was historically accurate, turns out quite a bit.

"Bridge of Spies","jeustace7","8 October 2015","I know that a portion of my positive experience in viewing this film came from the fact that I was privileged enough to see an advance screening attended by the Secretary of the Air Force, Francis Gary Powers Jr. (son of the U2 pilot downed in the USSR), and an AF Colonel who flew the U2 for the making of this film. All three spoke before the film and they had many warm words for Steven Spielberg's professionalism and his appreciation for uniformed service-members. Apparently Spielberg's father visited Russia during the Cold War and served as a radio operator in the military at some point- giving Spielberg a personal reason to ""get things right"" in the movie. I thought the film's strongest point was its edifying, anti-xenophobic message. Tom Hanks plays a kind of Atticus Finch in the face of McCarthy-style anti-Russian public sentiment. The (french?) recurring epithet for Hank's Character's resolve ""stoique majete"" (sp?) reminded me of the yiddish concept of a ""mensch."" And that's not too surprising seeing as the Coen Brothers co-wrote the script. Though there was no spiritual theme to the movie, I couldn't help but thinking of 1 Peter 5:6 ""Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time."" This would apply to Tom Hank's unassuming character who is elevated to more and more influential positions simply because he is faithful in the tasks he is given. Very refreshing to see a ""reluctant hero"" as realistic as this. Just a man willing to do the right thing even when it's unpopular. Definitely echoes of Oscar Schindler, one of Spielberg's previous protagonists. Also had a couple scenes that reminded me of Munich, though this film is much more enjoyable. Last thing I'll say is that I enjoyed a number of the casting decisions. Don't know that I could name any of the actors outside of Hanks, but it made the film so much more fun to have a strong actor in the role of the Russian spy (the relationship that develops between Hanks and the spy is really fun to watch). Hank's character's wife plays a small part but does a great job of portraying stern, loving concern without becoming grating. Honestly thought Powers (the downed pilot) could have been a little more two-dimensional, but the movie is clearly ""not about him"" so the movie didn't suffer and he had enough aw-shucks-young-american-in-the-60's to make him likable. Hank's one line to him is priceless. Such a relief to have a summary of the film's themes delivered in such an effortless way. Great film! And it got a thumbs-up from the downed-pilot's son in terms of historical accuracy (obviously some details changed for screenplay's sake). Enjoy!","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","gorlumello","27 January 2016","this is a silly and stupid set of stamps and manifestation of an inferiority complex from a lack of knowledge. In the film, the mass of historical and factual errors, and the film is not a history of the spy Rudolf Abel and his exchange on pilot Francis Gary Powers, and a pretentious propaganda picture.It all started back in the Spielberg movie ""Terminal"", but in this movie took a truly catastrophic proportions. Spielberg does not have a clue about life in the USSR and the GDR, and all of his view of life in these countries is based on a picture of the American propaganda magazines and newspapers of the time (ie, during the Cold War. Who started the United States and its allies, and the Warsaw Pact was created as a response against the NATO alliance. And the plan of offensive war in Europe, originally did not belong to the Soviet Union and the United States and the United Kingdom).If you are interested in the history of flying spy plane U-2 over the Soviet Union and the subsequent exchange of Francis Gary Powers to the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, see the Soviet movie ""Dead Season"". It is much better to do than this fake of Spielberg. In addition, in this old Russian movie authentic costumes, interiors and uniforms of the period. Unlike Spielberg film in which nothing is authentic, except for helmets GDR Army.By the way, Francis Gary Powers voluntarily told all in captivity, without tortures and horrors in ""Spilberg style"". Upon returning to the US, he was accused that not blew himself up along with the aircraft at ejection (under catapult CIA profit laid an explosive charge) and that did not take the poisoned needle for suicide (Francis Powers voluntarily gave the needle during the arrest).If you interesting to see a movie about Powers, watch Soviet movie ""We accuse"" (1985). As far as I know, in the United States was no movie about Francis Gary Powers. Although he fulfilled his soldier duty to the end, and died like a hero - rescuing children from falling helicopter.This movie - 0 from 10.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","mowasteph","7 March 2016","What is it about Spielberg? He has turned into the King of the Banal. Or perhaps he was always thus? Except for Jaws maybe?But let's start with the GOOD stuff first. First off, I'm okay watching a Spielberg movie because I know he's not going to be using HAND- HELD throughout the movie. I seriously appreciate the camera work of people like Spielberg or Wes Anderson because I know I don't have to take Dramamine to watch their stuff.Secondly, Rylance probably deserved his Oscar. He's so mysterious. You always want to know what is going on with that guy! I just loved his fake befuddlement near the beginning of the movie when the CIA bust in on him. Great stuff.Third - Hanks. Tom Hanks does a bang up job giving this character real humanity. He turns him into a real person...as much as he can, since there is not much of a real person in the way the character was written. Another one of Spielberg's stalwart heroes. Dull as dishwater - except for the fact that Hanks wrestles the human being out of the flat script.So now onto the stuff that bugs me - let's start with the ending. Seriously, this movie could have ended 10 minutes earlier. Why oh why does S.S. have to always put those crappy endings on his movies? Hero comes home to wide-eyed adoring wife and/or children. And I'm a bit tired of these cypher-like, no-personality wives in these stupid movies.Was the wife really part of the story? No, so it is not necessary to cram that character in there being all 50s wife-ish and yelling about what it's all DOING TO THE FAMILY and all that other trite crap. Since no women were actually involved in this story - historically - it's OKAY to not try to shoehorn a female character into it. We women won't get all offended! We'd much prefer you just leave out the doting wife crap altogether. And leave the precocious interactions with the son out too, please. Why is this stuff always in an S.S. movie? Every. Damn. Time.Was there a point to having Alan Alda show up for 5 minutes to be a dick? And why set up this whole thing with the young man who was going to assist Donovan with the case and then the character just...disappears. Could S.S. cast someone even REMOTELY interesting to play Powers? And was all of New York really all reading the same newspaper and staring Donovan down on the subway? I really hate these dumb, made-up movie scenarios. Finally, nobody ever shot up Donovan's house. You really lose your credibility when you spice up the truth with bull-dooky incidents.(As long as we are on that vein...did people in the late 50s/early 60s watch as much television as the family in this movie does? Wouldn't the little ones be outside playing stickball? Wouldn't the teen girl be up in her room playing 45s?)It wasn't torturous to watch this movie. But it was just a movie. What it mostly did was spur you onto the internet to read about the real people and the real incidents. But as you are sitting and watching and getting curious about ""the real story"" you will find yourself rolling your eyes a lot.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","palavitsinis","19 September 2016","After watching Sully, I went back to see some movies with Tom Hanks that I had skipped. Bridge of Spies was brilliant. The way in which a civilian, although a lawyer, was dragged into this whole thing and the way in which he handled it, was amazing and thrilling to watch. Mark Rylance was also breathtaking in his role as Rudolf Abel. The movie had a really nice plot behind it, amazing scenery and photography in general, and it did keep you at the edge of your seat. It was quite long, but still I felt like it could have used some extra time towards the end. My favorite moments were of course towards the end of the movie, when all loose ends are tied up one way or the other. Overall it was a performance by all actors but also by Tom Hanks in particular that was up there with all the major roles he has portrayed so far.","9/10"

"Bridge of Spies","metalrox_2000","24 November 2015","History comes alive with Bridge of Spies. Mark Rylance is excellently cast as Rudolph Able, by all appearances, a kindly man who just wishes to be alone with his paint set. Appearances are deceiving, as we learn he is actually a Russian spy. Playing out as a secondary story, we watch as Francis Gary Powers is selected to fly a US plane in order to gather intelligence on Russia. Given a poison to take should he be captured, Powers realizes how dangerous a mission he was about to undertake.James Donovan is charged with the task of providing Able a suitable defense, not unlike John Adams had been called to do nearly two hundred years before with the Red Coats who fired into the crowd at Boston. Donovan loses in court, but is able to spare Able's life, citing that killing him would only incite hostilities against the US by Russia.Powers' mission is a failure as he is shot down, and tortured by the Russians. To add to the events, the Berlin Wall is going up in Germany, causing strife in that country as well. Fredric Pryor, an American college student studying abroad, is taken prisoner. Sent under orders to do an even change, Able for Powers, Donovan doesn't like the idea of leaving an American behind.To the dismay of the US Government, Donovan begins to set negations to get both Pryor and Powers, telling the Russians that they won't get Able if the US doesn't get both of their citizens back. The drama intensifies as it appears Germany may balk at the suggestion of giving up Pryor.The events come to ahead on a snowy bridge, as Able and Powers stand on opposite sides of the bridge, not knowing if they would step foot on the homeland again. At the last second, the Germans show up at Checkpoint Charlie with Pryor, and the exchange is made, and Donovan is happy with his success, yet worried about Able's fate, as the two have become friends amongst the madness of world politics.The brisk pace of the movie, as well as the engaging characters make this a must see movie. Alan Alda proves he still has it, even though he appears briefly in the film. Both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance both forth such amazing performances, that both should be considered Oscar worthy.It's next to impossible to make a suspenseful film about a historical event of which you already know the outcome. Yet Spielberg is able to do just that. This is a true must see film! 10 out of 10.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","RNMorton","23 October 2015","Hanks plays lawyer and former counsel for the OSS who represents Soviet spy Rudolph Abel on espionage charges, and is then asked to broker a deal permitting Abel to return to Russia for the release of Francis Gary Powers, captured U-2 spy plane pilot. I have a natural distrust of Spielberg, most recently from the fictional War Horse, for being overly manipulative with his audiences. I have checked the basic facts behind this movie and they appear legit. If the movie was confirmed on a few other points I would give this a 10 without reservation. Sorry, for me historical movies (and particularly Biblical movies) need to be accurate - subtle deviations from the truth can (to me) create false impressions. As it is Hanks and Rylance (as Abel) are just superb, Hanks seems made for Spielberg's sort of movies. The period work is very impressive and cinematography superb. The story starts slowly but once things get going it moves along very well. This has the feel of Oscar work, just an impressive movie.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","SimonJack","11 July 2017","""Bridge of Spies"" is a first rate film about three true events that occurred at the height of the Cold War (1946-1991). They were headline news stories of their day. The first two incidents were unrelated but were tied together by the third event. Director Steven Spielberg and the writing team had a tough job condensing three stories over five years into a film of less than 2½ hours. They had to skip much detail, and the film seems crammed in places. Some things may not be apparent to one who doesn't know the history. The first event was the 1957 New York arrest, trial and conviction of Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy. The second event was the 1960 crash of an American spy plane over Russia and the arrest, trial and conviction of the pilot, Francis Gary Powers. The third event was the 1962 prisoner exchange of the two men, along with a second American. The first and last of these three events involve a third principal character, James Donovan, a New York attorney. The film revolves around Donovan and his role in the lives of the captive men. All of the cast are superb in their roles. The film naturally had Hollywood treatment, so some parts are fiction. Folks interested in the Cold War, or in espionage, or Soviet spying in particular, might enjoy more details. So, I offer some here from my study of these subjects. Rudolf Abel was one of many aliases of Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (1903-1971). Fisher was an English-born Russian. He moved to Russia in the 1920s, served in the military and became a Soviet intelligence officer. After World War II, he joined the KGB and was trained to spy in the U.S. He left Russia in 1948. Using different IDs and passports, he made his way across Europe to Canada and then the U.S. on Nov. 17. He operated in a spy ring under the code name, Mark. When things heated up, he was about to leave the U.S. with a new ID. But, he was arrested before he could leave. That was June 21, 1957.The film gives a sense of intrigue with Abel's capture. It didn't happen the way the movie portrays it. He answered the door in his hotel room and was arrested by FBI agents. But the scenes with a hollow nickel were one way to bring into the story a real aspect that led to Abel's capture. In 1953, a Brooklyn newspaper boy received a hollow nickel for payment when he was collecting for his paper route. He dropped the coin and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm. It wound up in the hands of the FBI. In time, through trailing other known Soviet spies, and the defection of one in May of 1957, the feds were able to corral Abel. The federal court in New York convicted him of spying and sentenced him to 30 years in prison. He had served just over four years in an Atlanta prison, when he was exchanged in 1962 for Gary Powers. Back home in Russia, Fisher lectured on his experiences until he died at age 68 in 1971.Francis Gary Powers (1929-1977) was a U.S. Air Force jet pilot during 1952-56. He was discharged from the Air Force as a captain in 1956, and went to work for the CIA to fly U-2 missions over the Soviet Union. Those began on Sept. 27, 1956 and continued into 1960. On May 1 of that year, Powers was shot down by a new Soviet ground to air missile, and parachuted to safety. On Aug. 19, the Soviet Union convicted him of espionage and sentenced him to three years in prison and seven years of hard labor. He served just over 21 months in prison before the February 10, 1962 exchange. The movie doesn't show it, but the Powers family and two American attorneys were at his trial.In later years, Powers received honors for his service. Soviet records released after the fall of the Iron Curtain verified the details Power had given of his U-2 flight. Powers died on Aug. 1, 1977 when his TV traffic helicopter crashed in Los Angeles. While making an emergency landing, he swerved to avoid hitting children playing in a park. James Donovan (1916-1970) took the Abel case after several others had turned it down. He had been in a private law firm just seven years after serving as a commander in the Navy. During World War II, he was associate counsel in a research and development office. After the war, he was assistant to Justice Robert H. Jackson, the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg war trials in Germany. Donovan was the main negotiator in the prisoner exchange of Abel and Powers, which also included an American student, Frederic Pryor. While the movie doesn't cover it, Donovan's efforts that same year and the next for Cuban exiles were as harrowing as his negotiations with the Soviets. In June, exiled Cubans asked him to negotiate the release of the Cuban Americans captured by Fidel Castro after the failed April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The negotiations concluded on July 3, 1963, and led to the release of about 1,100 people. Donovan was just 53 years old when he died of a heart attack in January 1970. A 1976 TV movie was made about Gary Powers. Lee Majors starred in ""Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident."" A 1948 movie, ""The Iron Curtain,"" stars Dana Andrews as Igor Gouzenko. He was a Soviet crypto clerk who defected and exposed a massive spy network in Canada and the U.S. The Soviets were way ahead of the U.S. in their espionage work after WW II and during the early years of the Cold War.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","maurice_yacowar","5 November 2015","Worried but smiling, Mary Donovan sees her husband off on his secret mission to East Berlin: ""Can't you give me something to go on? I don't even care if it's not true."" As the stay at home, perky wife, Mary doesn't have much role in the action — but that line strikes to the heart of Stephen Spielberg's Bridge of Spies. As insurance lawyer James Donovan learns when he's introduced to the web of lies woven by the Russian, American and East German governments, everyone indulges each other's fictions.When Donovan negotiates the exchange of Russian spy Rudolf Abel for the U2 pilot Gary Powers and a hapless American economics student taken prisoner in East Berlin, he finds layer upon layer of fiction. All the agents lie and hide. Actors are presented as Abel's family. The lawyer Vogel proves a rare bird, elusive in flight and of ambiguous power and role when finally spotted. Nobody is who they seem to be. The CIA enlists Donovan as negotiator because the swap is too touchy for governments to negotiate. Only Donovan refuses to lie. Mary doesn't believe his cover — the company sending him to Europe for clients — but even to assuage her fears all he says is ""I'm doing this for us."" They go through the marmalade game to confirm her confidence. The metaphor extends even further. When Donovan defends the Russian spy, when he enforces the Americans' guarantee of justice, he offends all America. Vigilante citizens shoot up Donovan's home. A cop turns against him, preferring to persecute rather than to protect him. The lawyers and judge want to present just the appearance of a fair trial — precisely what we disdain in the Russian autocracy. Donovan is totally invested in the moral principles of US justice, which the other lawyers, the judge and the embittered frightened citizens are all too willing to scuttle. Only by appealing to the judge's self-interest does Donovan manage to avoid his client's death sentence. The Golden Rule fails Donovan: Shouldn't we treat their spies as we would want them to treat ours? He wins by foreseeing the possibility of using Abel for an exchange the next time Russia catches an American spy. Pragmatism trumps principle. Tom Hanks's James Donovan is what the Russian spy Abel admires as ""the standing man,"" a character so strong of will and ideals that he stands by them whatever the cost and challenge. After the swap Donovan appears standing still solid — but dwarfed by the machinery of the bridge that looms black and impersonal over him. When he finally collapses on his bed at home, exhausted, he's still in that standing pose, though splayed out horizontal. The political chill of the Cold War permeates the West, as we see in the school kids' oath of allegiance and Duck and Cover drill, and in the sniffly cold that starts with Abel, overwhelms Donovan when a German gang steals his Saks Fifth Avenue overcoat, and passes on to the CIA agent. The white hanky signifies the characters' surrender to the era's paranoia, cruelty and abandonment of American values.That's what makes this film about now as much as then. The film addresses the current threat, America abandoning its values in their supposed defence against a monster enemy, whether their Communism or our current bogey, radical Islam. ""There's no book of rules,"" the CIA agent tells Donovan, attempting to violate the client-lawyer relationship. There is, Donovan reminds him — the constitution. Of course, the Supreme Court is split down the middle on what the constitution was intended to advance. But the principles of freedom, justice, protection of the individual, should guard against the system's corrupt pragmatism. That's the gist of Donovan's terse but resonant address to the Supreme Court. His appeal fails on the familiar 5-4 count. Bridge of Spies reminds us all of what distinguished America and made her a beacon for humanity worldwide. It also warns us how easy it is to abandon those values in the name of defending them. On the train home Donovan shows a flicker of disturbance when he sees American teenagers playfully leaping over backyard high wire fences. He's remembering the young people shot dead trying to leap the Berlin Wall? He's remembering his close call when he was threatened and robbed by the East Berliners? He sees the spectre of the fascist society in America? We're reminded that however great our social and political differences, we and our enemies are equally tempted to abandon our values for expediency. That's when we indulge our own fictions, which is even more dangerous than indulging each other's.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","gradyharp","14 February 2016","The setting for this based on a true story film is the 10950s – that tense period when in America children were put through classroom drills in case of an expected (or rather, feared) nuclear attack form Russia. Most people had bomb shelters stocked with supplies for the propaganda response that the Cold War ruled everyone's thinking. Remember those days? If not then this film will most assuredly force you to stare at the anxiety that ruled the politics and the military and the populace during that awful time.Steven Spielberg directs a script created by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman and has engaged a splendid cast that offers many insights into the thinking of that period. The story (for those who are shaky on facts and dates) is as follows: 'In the cold war, an insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II, is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers (Austin Stowell) who was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission- with a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) who was arrested for espionage in the US. The strong anti- Communist mood at the time makes him a target from those (the general populace) who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. And of course Donovan's theory works, emphasizing the humanity that can resist fear of the unknown in the time of Cold War. The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Alan Alda, Sebastian Koch, Amy Ryan and of course Hanks and Rylance. Superb script, well re-enactment of an ugly part of our history, and some fine nuances about faith in the democratic system make this one of the finest films of the year.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","tomgillespie2002","31 January 2016","Steven Spielberg's latest exercise in good ol' fashioned American wholesomeness, integrity and diplomacy transports us back to 1957, where undercover KGB agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is about to be busted by the FBI under suspicion of passing secrets onto the Soviets. The idealistic man at the centre of the story is James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer working in Brooklyn who joins the likes of John Quincy Adams, Oskar Schindler and Abraham Lincoln on the list of great, conflicted men caught up in a difficult period of upheaval and portrayed by Spielberg in an admiring light. And who better to play a man of such a clear sense of morality than Hollywood's favourite nice-guy Tom Hanks?Working with frequent collaborator Janusz Kaminski, Bridge of Spies is about a good-looking as a film gets. Infused with the same eye for detail and greyed-down solemnity of Lincoln (2012), the backdrops on show provide the perfect location for serious men talking serious business. The main crux of the film rests in the blossoming friendship between Donovan and Abel, who are captured on an equal par in a bleak interrogation room as the sun blazes through the blinds. These are two men from opposing sides, but share the share the same determination, stubbornness, and loyalty to the ideals of their country. Abel accepts his increasingly-likely execution as one of the requirements of his job, but Donovan wants to exercise his rights as a PoW, making himself public enemy number one in the process as his face splashes across the newspapers.Donovan also hopes to keep him as a tool should the need for a prisoner exchange rear its head in the future, which was incredible foresight for anyone who knows the true-life story. As Donovan fights for Abel in the courtroom, the United States are prepping their own mission - to send a spy plane over the Soviet Union to take photographs. Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is shot down and, after failing to swallow the cyanide given to him by his commanding officer in case he finds himself in such a perilous position, is taken prisoner by the Soviets and routinely tortured for information. The U.S. government again turn to Donovan in the hope of setting up an exchange just as American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) is also arrested.For a story so littered with intrigue and espionage, Bridge of Spies is oddly lacking in thrills and tension. When Donovan arrives for the exchange in Berlin as the Wall is being put in place, the city is hostile and seemingly lawless in areas, but instead the film focuses on the various bizarre characters, including a Petter Lorre- alike KGB man, who flock around Donovan, a man they simply do not know. Perhaps the unevenness in tone is down to a script-polishing by Joel and Ethan Coen, who never shy away from taking a genre and stamping their own particular brand of humour on it. Spielberg also cannot resist resorting to sentiment at the film's climax on the eponymous 'bridge of spies' (Glienicke Bridge). Still, this is Spielberg at his most professional, harking back to classic Hollywood while maintaining the relevance of the films themes.","10/10"

"Bridge of Spies","AmyJenson1995","23 February 2016","Who said that a thriller has to be violent to be considered as successful? Bridge of Spies is a smart movie about the Gary Powers affair, a dramatic event which could have become the spark of a destructive conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.Despite what the title may suggest, Bridge of Spies is not a movie about espionage. Don't expect to see thrilling chases, firefights or anything we could see in James Bond or Mission Impossible. This movie is about the real story of the efforts of one man, Jim Donovan, a Brooklyn lawyer specialized in insurance issues, who became involved in spite of himself in the most sensitive crisis of that time and, by using his negotiating skills, is trying to settle peacefully the crisis by organizing an exchange between Powers and a Soviet spy who was arrested prior to the crash of the U2.Once again, Tom Hanks is playing with perfection this role of a man who put his reputation, his life and his family's in line by defending a Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (played admirably by Mark Rylance) because he truly believes that anybody, whatever the charges are against him or her, deserves the right to be defended.Mark Rylance is also perfect impersonating Rudolf Abel. His performance is very sober and I have some sympathy for the character. As Donovan says in the movie, Abel is just a loyal soldier of his country and he should not be branded as a traitor as many did back in that time.But what gives to this movie all its credits is its sobriety and objectivity depicting the tension between the two sides back in that era, the hypocrisy of both judicial system including ours who wants the world to be considered as a model of justice but in reality are ready to deny the values of our country by violating the Constitution and depriving Abel of his basic right to defend himself.There are some scenes who literally broke my heart. I had tears watching Jim's son filling the bathtub of water because in school he learned that the first basic needs which couldn't be able to be fulfilled in case of a nuclear bombardment will be electricity and water or when those two people got shot to death while trying to climb the Berlin wall and escape the oppressive Soviet regime. I looked up and it turned out that more than 200 people were gunned down trying to escape including women.So yes maybe some would have preferred an action movie but for the ones who prefers a realistic recalling of the facts like myself will really appreciate this picture. We need more movies like Bridges of spies. Movies who can give you a realistic insight of what was going on. In that matter Bridge of spies is accomplishing its mission very perfectly.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","dave-mcclain","16 October 2015","A friend of mine recently posted on Facebook that his daughter had asked him who played the character called Hawkeye. ""Alan Alda,"" was my friend's reply, thinking of the surgeon on TV's ""M*A*S*H"". But my friend's daughter was asking about the Marvel Comics character in the ""Avengers"" films (played by Jeremy Renner). Besides amusing me, that little story got me thinking about how I was going to write my review of Steven Spielberg's historical drama ""Bridge of Spies"" (PG-13, 2:21). If I'm going to discuss a movie in which ""The U-2 Incident"" plays such a big part, it might be a good idea to point out that this reference has nothing to do with ticket scalping at a rock concert or anything of the sort. In fact, to better appreciate this review and, more importantly, Spielberg's film, you might want to do what I just did – reinforce and add to your historical knowledge of the aforementioned Cold War crisis, the Hollow Nickel Case and Rudolf Abel, Francis Gary Powers and James Donovan. Or you could just read my review and then go to the film, not just for a great cinematic history lesson but to see one terrific movie.Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer in the 1950s. Donovan is smart, honest, hard-working and, most importantly, he has principles and integrity – especially when it comes to the law. He has also served his country in uniform and assisted in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials. Donovan's law firm's senior partner (played, coincidentally, by the same Alan Alda mentioned in my previous paragraph) asks him to accept the thankless task of defending accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (multiple Tony Award winner Mark Rylance).Donovan is understandably less than enthusiastic about all of this, but his sincere belief that ""everyone deserves a defense"" leads him to take the case. In spite of (and because of) his patriotism, he represents this obviously guilty spy as zealously and ethically as he represents all his clients. In the vehement and almost universal anti-communism of 1950s America, Donovan runs down every ground ball, making him one of the most hated men in America – and even endangering his family. His wife (Amy Ryan) supports him throughout the case, but she has some trouble understanding the lengths that he goes to for Abel.Fast-forward a few years. Abel is still in prison, and Donovan brings him a letter supposedly from his wife in the U.S.S.R. The letter amounts to a back-channel proposal from the Soviets to discuss trading Abel for recently captured U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). C.I.A. director Allen Dulles personally asks Donovan to negotiate the swap – but as a private citizen, NOT as a representative of the U.S. government. Telling his wife he's going on a business trip to London, Donovan heads to East Berlin, just as the politically divided city is being physically divided by the construction of the Berlin Wall.With a C.I.A. employee (Scott Shepherd) briefing and supporting him, but needing to otherwise keep his distance, Donovan begins his dangerous mission. Navigating check points and a street gang, he walks alone from West to East Berlin for an appointment inside the Soviet embassy. He meets unofficially with another man to, as Donovan says, ""have the conversation that our governments can't"". Further complicating an already tenuous negotiation is Donovan's personal decision to insist that the prisoner swap include an innocent American university student recently detained by East German authorities. Clearly, it's going to take every ounce of Donovan's intelligence, skill and nerve to accomplish his objectives, not the least of which is avoiding getting shot or even detained and put on trial himself.""Bridge of Spies"" is that rare movie that can make history come to life and give it the immediacy of a first-class cinematic drama/thriller. Of course, there are those (as two people behind me in the theater seemed to do) who will walk out of a movie if it isn't very quickly filled with explosions, murders or at least a good chase scene, but short-sighted individuals like that miss an opportunity to enjoy the artistry of well-crafted stories that, sadly, are not as common as they used to be. This entire cast is exceptional, especially Hanks, who is as at the top of his game in full-on thinking man's ""boy scout"" mode, and Mark Rylance who deserves significant awards season recognition and, of course, the always impressive Ryan.I should mention that the Cold War intrigue highlighted in the film's trailers is all in the second half of the film, but the script, co-written by Matt Charman and none other than Ethan and Joel Coen, is smart and compelling throughout. That story, coupled with Spielberg's expert touch, impressively recalls a time and tone that few Americans still remember, while giving us the twin dramas of a Soviet spy in the U.S. and a downed U.S. pilot in the Soviet Union. These two tales are seamlessly woven together and perfectly edited. The film also reminds us that what makes all of us Americans are not the political or religious beliefs we hold, but the principles we all stand for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is as American as apple pie and about as rewarding an experience as anyone, regardless of nationality, could hope a film to be. ""A""","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","blackwidowis7cool","10 August 2019","Pretty much historically accurate movie about a lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is hired to defend captured KGB agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in a court trial and ends up organizing an exchange for two captured Americas Powers and Pryor in exchange for Abel. (Bad plot description, sorry).
This is a great and very well-done movie. Spielberg does another awesome job with this movie. It has great themes and is thought-provoking at times. It has a great message about standing up for what is right, even if/when everyone else hates you for doing it.
This is Tom Hanks best role (that I've seen so far, anyway). He does a fantastic job as Donovan and literally embodies in every sense who the real Donovan was. Everyone does an awesome job, really. Their acting is very believable.

Rather its valued; perhaps, one of the important outcomes of watching this drama-caper.Based on the negotiations for American-Soviet spy exchange of ""Powers for Abel"", and the craftsmanship of American insurance lawyer, James Donovan.Only when one started to think that it would be a regular, even a little banal-looking account of some Cold War events, it came out to be not just different but a lot better than imagined. Surprisingly comical, this politically paced drama-thriller keeps one hooked for more than usual reasons - which has now become a typical attribute of a Steven Spielberg film, and doesn't stop surprising.Tom Hanks, with his effortless portrayal of Donovan, and the ""staggeringly sharp"" Mark Rylance as the Russian Spy Rudolf Abel - remarkably contribute in the film's subtle nod to the spirit of resilience and men of courage. As aptly stated in a Russian phrase for ""Standing Man"" - of virtue, of missions, of patriotism and of the families.Watchable, enjoyable, and likable! Clear 8/10","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","oscaralbert","19 October 2015",". . . actually believe that they should uphold the American Constitution in practice (if even in theory). Spielberg proves many if not most American law enforcement and military officers, prosecutors, judges, and lawmakers perjure themselves when they take their oaths of office to live at U.S. taxpayer expense. Crooked FBI and CIA agents, prosecutors, judges, and cops abound in Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES. All of them apparently had their fingers crossed behind their backs when they were sworn into their offices, thinking that they will ""uphold the Constitiution"" only when it's convenient and profitable to themselves to do so, treating it like toilet paper whenever it conflicts with their personal agendas, profit motives, idiosyncratic belief structures, or if they feel a sudden urge to enjoy an ""opposite day"" at the Constitution's expense (not unlike most of the officials depicted in the current release, BLACK MASS). I say, cut the hypocrisy now! Things have gotten much worse in America since 1957, when the BRIDGE OF SPIES story begins. Let President Obama make it official, and tear up that ratty old parchment signed by James Madison & Co. on a live national TV broadcast. Follow up this PURGE-with-a-purpose by letting the Walton Family, whose Wal-Mart Co. just had a really bad week, dash off a New Constitution everyone can believe in, as a gesture which says, ""Thanks for all the fish!""","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","cagebox111","2 May 2022","Bridge of Spies is a fantastical movie and the second-best collaboration between Spielberg and Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan has to be #1). Bridge of Spies tells the real story of a lawyer who is called on to represent a Soviet Spy in the heart of the Cold War. Though much of the movie concerns a hostage exchange and is tense and interesting, I found the actual trial and ethical complications around the trial the most interesting. At the time, America was anticipating a nuclear war with the hated Soviets and the thought of representing the captured spy in court must have been a daunting one. The movie stands up for the Constitution and holds dear to American ideals that make the country the great nation it is.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","orkunkeskin","17 May 2016","Beside the good acting of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, there isn't many good things about this movie. Tom Hanks appears as a symbol of 'great' America, doing the right things one after another, even though the authorities are against it (like it is possible for him to act so independent) to symbolize how 'great' is the US.On the other hand Soviets are the evils as usual. Tortures against American soldier/spy, hostile military officers even against their own spy ( while American soldier does the exact opposite), scared children that got education at school about nuclear war (ironically with the footage of nuclear experiments that US did) and many other things that show how evil the Soviet was. But the American side had right causes to act unjust (not evil, just unjust) because they are patriots which is a good thing.To summarize, it is all about taking necessary dosage of American propaganda with some good acting.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","nclka1990","4 February 2016","Steven Spielberg does not make bad films. Okay, admitted there might be one or two exceptions (I'm looking at you Crystal Skull!). However, he has not made a really good film since Munich in 2005. With Bridge of Spies he returns to a well-known arena for him with a story centred around the defense trial of a Soviet spy caught in Cold War America and the subsequent prisoner exchange with the Soviet Union and German Democratic Republic. Teaming up with the Coen Brothers as the film's writers, masterful composer Thomas Newman and regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has probably made his best film in 10 years!The story is divided in two: the first half centred around the trial of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and the second half focusing on the proposed prisoner exchange with the USSR and GDR. The first half is small-scale courtroom drama where we get to see the political idealism and propaganda originally behind the American defense of the most hated man on US soil. The courtroom scenes and portrayal of the actual trial might be the film's weakest asset feeling rushed and unimportant. The real drama in this first part lies in the chemistry and increasing relation between Rudolf Abel and Tom Hanks' lawyer James B. Donovan and the study of the personal consequences of this for Donovan's private life. Especially the chemistry between Tom Hanks and the impeccable Mark Rylance as Abel is a joy to behold. Highly acclaimed stage actor Rylance's performance is one of the best supporting roles I have seen in years. He underacts Abel perfectly and he becomes the image of the hopelessness that were everywhere in these times. Donovan keeps asking Abel if he never worries and before Rylance can say 'Would it help?' we already know that this is Abel's view on it; he is way past that point. Hanks also delivers his best performance in years as the idealistic yet vulnerable Donovan and especially in the scenes with his family he shows that he is one of the best to portray the ordinary man. Roughly half way through the film, though, we leave the small-scale setting of the courtrooms, the prison cells and the living room as Donovan is sent on a secret mission to East Berlin to negotiate the exchange of Abel for by-the-soviets-captured American soldier Francis Gary Powers. The story of Powers prior to his capture feels weirdly out of place, but as the story unfolds this actually makes sense. In this exchange drama (that suddenly includes an American student held by GDR too btw) the persons captured does not matter in the bigger picture. It is all about showing the public that you do not leave people behind - the return of Powers is to become the symbol of the American power in the cold war! The most interesting asset of the film's second part is its portrayal of the very dawn of a physically divided Berlin. This is the dawn of the Wall, the dawn of 'us' and 'them'! Spielberg portrays the small-scale horrors and the grand scale political drama of this situation with such respect that it is close to becoming predictable.What ultimately saves the day for Spielberg (apart from tremendous performances from Hanks and Rylance) is sheer sense and amount of quality. The cinematography of Kaminski is grand when it needs to be and hauntingly gruesome in its simplicity when showing the horrors of Eastern Berlin. (Here, a certain train ride is in particular touching!). The score from Thomas Newman is classic and without surprises but as with the rest of the machinery it is simply just of the highest quality and fits perfectly in every scene. Finally, the script by Ethan and Joel Coen balances perfectly between the little drama, the grand thriller and some refreshing comedic scenes and pieces of dialogue. The film is a showpiece of how you construct a well-working film. It lacks the final surprise or courage to become a masterpiece like Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, but if everything in Hollywood were to collapse this film stands as an example of why Spielberg will always get back up and be the standing man.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","brutzel","5 February 2016","In the late 1950s insurance lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is tasked by the CIA with defending Russian spy Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance) in a U.S. court of law. Later Donovan is tasked with negotiating the swap of Abel for downed U.S. U2 (spy plane) pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). Then Donovan learns of an American Economics student, Frederick Pryor (Will Rogers) held by the Russians and wants to do a 2-for-1 deal that the CIA is against. The CIA just wants Powers. Here we go.The only action scenes show the U2 spy plane being hit by Russian missiles and Gary Powers trying to reach the plane's self destruct button. These scenes are extremely good. Other than those brief action scenes, this is a talk-fest, but the conversations don't drag and are very concise among the Russians, the East Germans (this was the time the Berlin Wall went up), the CIA, some other U.S. government officials and James Donovan.The most engaging scenes are between Rudolph Abel and Donovan and they are excellent as the dialogues were spot on. When Donovan asks Abel why he doesn't show that he is worried Abel replies, "" Would it help?"" It wouldn't surprise me if Mark Rylance as Abel is nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Award. He is really good. This was history being made and this story is well told. There is nothing complicated and you always know what is going on. However, I was not aware that Donovan also wanted to get Pryor out of Russia as part of the deal. Tom Hanks as James Donovan in this role is perfect. As always.Unlike most spy stories, there really is no tension in here, but there is some suspense later on when the spy swap is supposed to take place at the Glienicke Bridge and at Checkpoint Charlie.

"Bridge of Spies","AudioFileZ","24 October 2015","The first crisis of the cold war is hardly remembered as both The Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis have eclipsed the debacle of captured U2 pilot Gary Powers and Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. Bridge of Spies, aptly named is Steven Spielberg's moving, and entertaining, big-screen correction of, perhaps, the mostly forgotten story of the first major diplomacy between the superpowers in the avoiding thermo-nuclear war.The story revolves around a somewhat obscure attorney and great American (at least prior to the events depicted) James Donovan. A brittle serendipitous stage of events, uniquely, fell into place as ""the sum of all fears"" began to reach a fever-pitch from which an unlikely chain of events thrust insurance attorney Donovan into the spotlight. It was not an enviable spotlight for Donovan as his only purpose was to avert any possibility of Rudolf Abel not being professionally represented in what could be an international incident.It was believed a swift and certain verdict of guilty with the death penalty would be reached justly. The message would be the U.S.A. is fair and just, but unwavering in intent. There was only one thing, Donovan was nobody's lackey.To James Donovan being a red-blooded American meant first and foremost upholding the constitution because it is what separated America from all other nations. Donovan believed any accused human, citizen or not, gets the rights guaranteed by the constitution in a U.S. court of law. While he didn't wholly succeed at first he set a series of events in motion that ended up defining post World War II détente. Spielberg masterly brings this story of a man who steps forward to embody something greater than himself at great cost. Fighting for something larger,he not only defines himself, but who we are as a nation. In the interim, before the righteousness the man stands on is actually embraced he may just be labeled a pariah, there's no doubt Donovan was being the target of many death threats. And without the lack of support from his family and employer. Slowly though his moral wisdom rises to save two men from prison and a nation from greater threat of nuclear war. This is a piece of American history very deserving to be retold, sure for entertainment, but also for our inspection. A real defining moment in history whose good set a precedent. This is, another of Tom Hank's finest moments. He captures the essence of a man whose time to become something more curiously fell into place. This, combined with the impeccable period sets and concisely powerful writing, make Bridge of Spies a very important movie that celebrates a lesser known historical event; an event which still defines how two mortal enemies can achieve a kind of peaceful outcome. I give this movie my highest recommendation and could care less even if there is slight artistic freedom interwoven; it gets the big things right and makes me proud. We need more men like James Donovan...maybe more than ever.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","ingmarbeldman-753-927212","15 February 2016","Name every aspect involving making a film and thumbs go up with this one.The master speaks, uses his skills to the sublime. No one doubts. Spielberg at his best. Right?Yes, but...1/3 courtroom, 2/3 cold war suspense. Thats a rough outline of the scrips structure. The latter would be deeply satisfying for it's exiting, sentimentally old- fashion, home- cooked cold-war-spy-movie grandeur. But it is not satisfying to me. Why? Because there is a 1/3 courtroom part that is so much more, so much more promising, so much more layered, with so many exiting set-ups, that i miss - i miss him more often these days - good old Clint Eatwood to bring all that complexity to a satisfying end. The first part is not about cold war, not about a spy and not about court. The fist part is about.....us. Us people in modern days turmoil , caught in the middle of international terrorist fear. In the middle of fear for Muslims, in the middle of fear for 'the other' human being, in the middle of group pressure, consensus, media hysteria, etc..... The first part is showing a hero who thinks for himself, who is not giving in to group- thinking, who dares to stand alone, who uses reason in the right way, who is a hero because he keeps his brain sound and clear, his private property, not owned by Apple, Google or God knows who..... All in the setting of the 50s. This 1/3 part promises a movie that uses a cold war concept to dig deeper into the psychology of group thinking and the harmful consequences of it.Instead, we turn to a good old spy movie, Spielberg forgets his million-dollar worth set-ups, leaves us alone with the moral expectations we developed and gives us goodies and baddies....with a twist, sure, but......Americans that think, act straight and...... Eurpoeans that act weird and confused.Great movie to watch, because it is nothing more than great popcorn. My favorite is white ceddar cheese btw...","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","rusoviet","13 March 2016","...Spielberg's films do.Even allowing for the time (1957/62) difference (2014), the scenes reminded me of a 'stage set' - faux walls, sky etc.. In addition the award to Rylance wasn't warranted. His script was nearly a monotone and always let Spielberg make a bolshevik/red 'human'.The historic accuracy re. the second 'captive' 'Pryor', was false - another 'trick' by Spielberg to 'add' some human/family hook.A far better script would have added after successfully negotiating the exchange for Francis Gary Powers, Donovan's negotiated the freedom of initially 1,103 but expanded to 9,703 Cuban anti-Castro men women and children.With Spielberg, as with all Hollywood leftists, there is always the kid glove treatment of the horror of the reds, even allowing for the callous machine gunning of the fleeing East Germans over the wall. In Schindler's List, Spielberg made sure he got his anti-gun message in the final scene when the Jews are surrounded by the German SS guards and tell them (the Germans) to go. In the movie no one has firearms in reality the Jews did and had them pointed at the Germans.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","adrian-j-ng","5 December 2015","I personally felt this film was not to my taste. I went in expecting a nice meaty courtroom drama. Turned out it was something else entirely. Something bereft of any drama at all, really. This film is about a man who faces numerous obstacles that he needs to overcome in order to do the right thing. The problem is that each time he comes across an obstacle turns out all he has to do is simply ask someone to remove it for him! And for some reason they do it for him! Every single time! He does this over and over again throughout the film. It's ridiculous. If he can simply ask for whatever wants then there is nothing at stake. There is never any tension. I wish I had not wasted my money. And I wish I had instead sat at home watching a tin of beans heat up in a microwave. And because everyone knows you can't put metal things in a microwave, it would have at least provided more drama and more tension than the entirety of this very long and very boring film.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","aharmas","18 October 2015","It has become customary to expect the best from Steven Spielberg, the man behind so many classics in American cinema, and he keeps growing as an artist, always availing himself of the best team, and working along with them to give us the finest quality in the art of cinema. IN ""Bridge of Spies"" he has directed an old fashioned film which shows in precise detail how the art of diplomacy might not have been invented but fine tuned, with grace and good intentions. With the help of Tom Hanks, a great choice for the lead character, Spielberg takes on a trip to the past, to show us the world of politics and the Cold War in the 1950's. It's a time of fear and paranoia, a world that expects the worst and chases its own tail in order to find a solution that might not exist. Both Russia and the United States are expecting the worst. Regular people live in constant fear that today might be their last day. Kids receive training in school to get them ready for the moment the world will be destroyed, with everyone living in a cloud of atomic waste.One day a ""spy"" is detained by the FBI, and Hanks is hired to defend him, though it's just a charade since everyone knows the result before the case even goes to court. Somehow, Hanks predicts there are possibilities to allowing the prisoner to remain in jail. This sets off acts of violence against the defender for his anti patriotism. Without giving much away, he finds himself in the middle of international deals, with two partners going at each other when one feels the other is either outsmarting or slighting each other. Egos are bruised and soothed, and lives are in danger because arrangements are not that easy to make.Eventually, everything is resolved, not without last minute twists that could undo every bit of work. This is the time when Hank shines, by portraying that everyman persona that makes him so endearing and popular. He wins us over with his intelligence and his big heart. James Stewart was very good at playing this type, and his match is Hanks, a very talented actor who once again proves that with the help of a great team behind him, he has found his niche again, and we are given movie gold.""Spies"" brings back a world lone gone, with extreme detail going into his production and much care at the heart of the script. With every performer giving his best in order to fully realize a vision. The result is a classic, a film that makes us think and satisfies us.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Tweekums","17 March 2017","Set at the height of the cold war Soviet spy Rudolf Abel is arrested in New York; nobody is keen to represent him in court but eventually James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer with previous experience at the Nuremberg trials, takes on the job. He is not expected to do much more than go through the motions but he is determined that Abel will represented to the best of his ability even if that makes him unpopular. Donovan is adamant that Abel must be given the best defence as demanded by the US Constitution not doing so would make America little better than countries that don't have fair trials. Somewhat inevitably Abel is found guilty but Donovan makes a very logical plea against the expected death sentence if for no other reason he should be kept alive so that the United States will have somebody to trade if one of their spies is caught by the Soviets. Not long afterwards just such an event happens when US pilot Gary Powers is shot down while flying a U2 spy plane high over the Soviet Union. Shortly afterwards another American is arrested on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain; this time a student in East Berlin. Donovan soon finds himself in Berlin, where he is to negotiate with the Soviets to exchange Abel for Powers however he wants both Powers and the student; it won't be easy though as the latter is held by the East Germans and the CIA aren't at all bothered about getting him back; they just want Powers before he cracks and starts to spill secrets about the U2 project.This is very much a film of two halves; both of them gripping. The first half is a court room drama where Donovan represents Abel to the best of his abilities even though it makes him very unpopular with a population that seems to think that anybody who represents a suspected spy is little better themselves; during this we also get scenes showing Powers entering the U2 programme and explanations of his mission before his eventual shooting down. These scenes serve to introduce the main characters and their situations but are still gripping in their own right. Tension raises significantly once the action moves to Berlin as it is made clear that if anything goes wrong while Donovan is in East Berlin he doesn't have any formal protection. There is a sense of anti-communist paranoia in America but this is nothing compared to the tension in East Berlin were people are being shot trying to cross the newly erected Berlin Wall. Tom Hanks does a great job as Donovan; an apparently ordinary man who has found himself in an extraordinary situation. Mark Rylance also stands out as Abel; a likable character with a dry sense of humour. Director Steven Spielberg does a fine job keeping the story gripping and capturing the feel of the era. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","zkonedog","27 February 2017","The combination of director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks is almost certain to produce a quality product at the cinema. That's exactly what happens (again) with ""Bridge of Spies"". It probably won't be your favorite effort from either of those two film luminaries, but it is instead a quite, brooding tale about life and espionage during the Cold War.For a basic plot summary, ""Bridge of Spies"" tells the adapted-from-true-events story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer tapped to defend one of the most hated men in America, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is convicted of spying in our homeland for the Soviet Union. Donovan first fights for Abel's rights (when no one else will seem to, even in full breach of the law), then is sent to Russia in order to facilitate an espionage-laden exchange mission.The area in which ""Bridge of Spies"" works best is when it can relate the themes of the Cold War to everyday life, showing that the events around the world may change over time, but people's reactions to them are usually more predictable. The overwhelmingly negative and hateful response to Abel's more presence in the country is startlingly familiar to the country's response to people of Islamic faith after 9/11. Seemingly all rule of law (and even some of decency) was thrown out the window in favor of ""patriotic justice"". Early in the film, there is also a poignant angle dealing with how children are reacting to Cold War tensions. At school, they are taught to ""duck and cover"" in case of an Atomic explosion (right after reciting the pledge of allegiance, of course), and at home Donovan's children are all very conflicted about how he could possibly defend the ""Commie traitor"".Bolstering those themes is the expected brilliance from Hanks in the leading role. Here, he is very much akin to, say, Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", or the typical Jimmy Stewart ""defend peace and law at all costs"" type role. In a world turned upside-down with misinformation about the Communists and hatred about something that isn't probably understood, Hanks's Donovan is able to keep a level head and pursue the tasks that really seem to make a difference, such as diplomacy and preserving the rule of law.The only reason ""Bridge of Spies"" probably isn't even better is that the ""espionage stuff"" over in Russia, while still rather entertaining in general, isn't the highlight of this film. The themes in the first half or so of the movie, feating Donovan's interactions with his family and the Abel case, just work on a deeper level. It still turns out to be a pretty emotional and satisfying ending, but the time spent in Russia is where things tend to get a little formulaic or draggy. Again, nothing terrible, but enough for me to drop this to four stars instead of an all-out five.Overall, I enjoyed the deep themes and powerful messages of ""Bridge of Spies"", as well as the notable acting performances given. It is a movie that can really be enjoyed by anyone teenaged years and up, as it touches on so many distinct avenues to get its message across. That Cold War era is one that often doesn't get its ""fair shake"" in history books or curriculums, so it is nice to see Spielberg bring it to the masses.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","sol-","23 November 2015","Based on the true story of an American insurance lawyer who wound up negotiating spy exchanges during the Cold War, 'Bridge of Spies' does a sterling job depicting tensions and insecurities during one of the most volatile periods in US history. While the focus of the film is always the American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, the film successfully weaves in several subplots that hint at what it was like to live during the Cold War. Most potently, the lawyer's son becomes obsessed with preparing for nuclear disaster after watching one too many propaganda films at school. Not so successfully woven in are two subplots involving the men who Hanks has to negotiate getting back in exchange for a captured Russian spy. The time-line of events in the film is also a little incredulous; no sooner has Hanks pleaded for the Russian's spy life to be spared in case of prisoner exchange is a prisoner exchange suddenly put on the table. Never to mind, Mark Rylance is superb as the Russian spy who hilariously keeps asking ""would it help?"" whenever Hanks asks him if he is worried. In fact, there is quite a bit of oddball humour in the film (Burghart Klaussner answering the wrong phone, etc), which can probably be chalked up to the Coen Brothers script. Furthermore, one of the film's strongest assets is how it balances light humour and very grim drama. As icing on the cake, the film looks superb with accurate period sets/costumes and lots of fluid, mobile camera-work from Janusz Kaminski. Thomas Newman provides an effective score too in lieu of John Williams.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","vsks","26 October 2015","Stephen Spielberg's riveting new film portrays the real-life events and personalities that led to a historic U.S.-Soviet-East German prisoner exchange in the frozen depths of the Cold War. In 1962, in a divided Berlin, an accused Soviet spy is to be traded for two Americans, if all goes well. An off-the-books U.S. negotiator has led the Soviets and the East Germans separately to the brink of agreeing the exchange, but hostilities are strong, motives are complex, and success is far from guaranteed. Based on the 2010 Giles Whittell book of the same name, the story centers around the intertwined fates of William Fisher, born Rudolf Abel, a British-born KGB agent whom the FBI arrested in New York; Francis Gary Powers, U.S. pilot of a super-secret U-2 spy plane shot down while flying over Russia; and Frederic Pryor, an American graduate student who finds himself on the wrong side of the new Berlin Wall and in the hands of the Stasi, East Germany's notorious secret police. Spielberg tells these men's stories, but centers on the role of U.S. insurance attorney James Donovan in the negotiations. Donovan's role initially is to defend Abel in his trial on espionage charges. He takes on this thankless task, even though everyone in the country, including the judge in the case, believes Abel is guilty. However, American legal processes need to be followed, if only to show the world that every prisoner receives a fair trial (an ironic punctiliousness half a century later). Inevitably, Abel is convicted, but at least Donovan persuades the judge not to invoke the death penalty. It's a controversial choice for Donovan to decide to appeal the verdict, and one that puts himself—and perhaps his family and career—in some danger. When Powers's plane is shot down, the possibility of a prisoner swap is immediately seized upon by the CIA. They want Powers back. He knows too much. Donovan is asked to negotiate an Abel-Powers trade, unofficially. What he encounters on all sides in Berlin is stubborn resistance salted with suffocating paranoia. He also hears about the unlucky American student and insists he be part of the deal, which the CIA rejects. They're not interested. The acting is terrific, especially Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel. In smaller roles, the CIA agents and Soviet and East German negotiators are suitably opaque and blustering. Amy Ryan, Donovan's wife, is always excellent. They have the benefit of working from a strong script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen, and Joel Coen. I particularly liked how, whenever Donovan asks Abel if he is worried about some particular outcome, Abel responds, ""Would it help?"" The look of the film is exactly right—cold, forbidding—and the Glienicke Bridge, site of the hoped-for exchange is a desolate place. Spielberg's handling of Donovan as ""the standing man,"" underscoring a metaphor introduced by Abel, works. If only he'd resisted a few message-heavy Hollywood touches (East Germans versus U.S. children scrambling over a wall, for example), it would have been perfect.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","vav-61764","9 November 2015","Bridge of Spies is the fourth collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. This particular one is much more focused on persuasive and intense dialogues and not on big action scenes, but due to the beauty and consistency of the conversations, the film doesn't become boring.It has a captivating and inspiring plot and is based on a true story that took place during the Cold War. As presume, the direction is spectacular, Steven Spielberg once again proves to be one of the best. With the help of Janusz Kaminski, movie cinematographer, they manage capture the minutiae and subtleties in each scene, making the picture having an amazing aesthetic, besides the setting and scenery being very well-constructed and provide a higher truthfulness to the movie. Considering the portrayed event and troubled time that happened, the film could have brought a higher tension, the lack is mostly felt around Tom Hanks' character, James B. Donovan, as he's doing something so outrageous in the Americans' perspective. The hostility is there,it's perceptible but it's not high as it might be. A aspect which could help fulfill this need is the soundtrack, which didn't show up as expected, instead was restrained and discreet. Tom Hanks is the highlight among the cast, he delivers a great performance. The character is fantastic, his power of rhetoric and persuasion are astonishing as a result his speeches are just jaw-dropping. Another good acting was Mark Rylance being Rudolf Abel. He transmits such serenity and wisdom due to his personality, and when he and Tom Hanks are in the same scene, you just sit back and enjoy their chemistry creating some impressive discussions.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Anurag-Shetty","22 October 2015","Bridge of Spies is a biopic about an American lawyer named, James B. Donovan(Tom Hanks). During the Cold War, the FBI capture a spy from the Soviet Union named, Rudolf Abel(Mark Rylance). Donovan's firm, gives him the task of defending Abel, in a court of law. Donovan's insistence on being the best possible lawyer for the enemy nation's spy, makes him come under fire from the American government & press. Donovan somehow prevents Abel from being executed in the electric chair. This later comes in handy, when an American pilot named, Francis Gary Powers(Austin Stowell) gets captured in the Soviet Union. Now, it is up to James B. Donovan to facilitate a prisoner exchange & bring back Powers, safely to the US. Bridge of Spies is a spectacular film. Director Steven Spielberg, has made another masterpiece. This movie is even better than Spielberg's other biopics like, Lincoln(2012) & Schindler's List(1993). Lincoln(2012) is great, but it is slow. Schindler's List(1993) is a classic but, it is a bit slow as well. However, Spielberg has successfully pulled it off with this film. Bridge of Spies is primarily a drama but, it is extremely thrilling. You just don't know what's going to happen next, even in the final minutes of the film. I would have given this film a ten if it was say, 10 minutes shorter. Then, it would have been even more gripping. The suffering in Berlin during the time of the Berlin Wall, has been accurately depicted & is heartbreaking. Apart from Spielberg's brilliant direction, the performances are another highlight of the movie. Tom Hanks is outstanding as James B. Donovan. Hanks is charming, adds humor to the serious proceedings & can also be intense when the script needs him to be. Mark Rylance is amazing as Rudolf Abel. Amy Ryan is great as Mary Donovan. Stephen Kunken is good as William Tompkins. Austin Stowell is awesome as Francis Gary Powers. Will Rogers is impressive as Frederic Pryor. Mikhail Gorevoy & Sebastian Koch are superb as Ivan Schischkin & Wolfgang Vogel respectively. Jillian Lebling, Noah Schnapp & Eve Hewson are brilliant as Peggy Donovan, Roger Donovan & Carol Donovan respectively. The supporting characters are impressive too. Bridge of Spies is a must watch, for all Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks fans. Go for it!","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","robert-temple-1","15 April 2016","This film is an example of myth-making, whether intentional or not I do not know. There is very little chance that the U-2 spy aircraft supposedly 'shot down' in 1960 by the Soviets in the notorious 'U-2 Incident' was really shot down at all. The various existing stories significantly contradict each other. The Russians say they fired one S-75 Dvina missile, but two different internet sites say that seven or thirteen missiles were fired, one shooting a MIG-19 out of the sky by mistake. I do not believe that any of these stories is true. We now know that Lee Harvey Oswald insisted the plane was never really shot down, and papers released in 2012 by the CIA show that they never believed either that their own man, the young pilot Francis Gary Powers, was really shot down. So why should the film suggest that he was and perpetuate a now discredited myth? It was apparently impossible for the Soviets' S-75 missile to hit a target flying at above 70,000 feet as the U-2 was. Nor did they have the guidance and control capacity to hit the plane even if a rocket existed which could get that high with any semblance of accuracy. The film shows the plane crashing nose-downward, which contradicts the official report that it crashed nose-upwards. But it appears that the truth is it never crashed, and merely landed normally, as part of a complex and mysterious political plot. It has been suggested that this was to derail détente, but that may not be the whole story. There are other ambiguities regarding Powers himself. There seems to be no certainty as to his birthplace. In the 1960s he was said to be from Pound, Virginia, but on Wikipedia it says Jenkins, Kentucky, or perhaps Burdine, Kentucky. All three places are near one another on the Kentucky-Virginia border, and I used to know the area well. In the old days, apart from Highway 23, there was nothing but dirt tracks. The region is one of the wildest and most remote in the entire Appalachians. I have spent many, many weeks there in the distant past. The area was populated almost entirely by genuine hillbillies, who lived in log cabins and still hunted with flintlock rifles. I know this because I met them as a child, entered their log cabins, and held their flintlocks. I was not allowed to fire one because the gunpowder was precious and they cast their own lead ball shot from an iron mould. But the boy who let me hold and aim his own precious flintlock, which had an immensely long barrel and had 'belonged to my great-great-great-grand-pappy', was from about 1800 or even earlier. Using it, the family got most of their wild meat. The boy told me, in words I shall never forget: 'I can shoot the head off a squirrel at a hundred yards with my flintlock.' It was from this wild area that Powers was supposed to have originated, as well as another well known and notorious CIA-linked figure. (The coincidence of two major spy figures coming from the same dot on the map is impossible.) I also knew as a child a genuine local man who told me the CIA and FBI both had a special connection with Pound, Virginia, and that he had been hired himself by the FBI to do messenger work across the South and to report regularly to Pound. When Powers died mysteriously in 1977, many people thought he had been murdered. So all of these matters are extremely murky, and we shall probably never know the real truth about any of it. As for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, I do not know what the film's agenda is for showing him as a quiet gentle, thoughtful, and artistic man, who is repeatedly described as 'honourable'. Why also is the entire American population shown in the film as foaming-at-the-mouth McCarthyites who want to lynch Abel and Donovan? Are Soviet spies being set up as the new heroes? What is going on with this film? The idea that the supposedly naive insurance lawyer Donovan would be taken to see Allen Dulles, who would tell him he could carry out his own private negotiations with the Soviets at the height of the Cold War involving a spy and a captured pilot, is totally and outrageously ludicrous. Donovan had been part of the legal team at Nuremberg and must have had intelligence affiliations already in the 1940s. Rudolf Abel (aka Willie Fisher) appears to have been a failure as a Soviet spy in America, and it defies belief that the Soviets would exchange a high-value captured American airman for him. The suspicion is that the American and Soviet security services cooperated secretly, with or without the knowledge of their own governments, to stage these phoney events. The film does not make clear that Abel had been in jail for four years before the swap for Powers, and was hence 'old news'. The film maintains that the East Germans resented and defied the Soviets, which is absurd, since East Germany was the most supine and devoted Soviet satellite state in the entire Warsaw Pact. If the Germans had behaved as shown in the film, they would have been summarily executed. Why are we expected to swallow all this nonsense? The direction of the film by Stephen Spielberg is superb, and the performances by Tom Hanks as the lawyer Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel are outstanding in every way. (Powers features only as a minor figure in the two parallel stories shown here, which only come together with the spy swap on the bridge in Berlin.) But how much better and more interesting the film would have been if it had been accurate, and had explored the many mysterious byways and unanswered enigmas and contradictions. Instead, it adds to the existing, enormous disinformation overload.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","phd_travel","30 October 2015","This meticulously made and filmed movie is fascinating and topical considering the state of relations with Russia today.Some crucial things that should have been shown are left out. This movie had too much focus on Tom Hank's character Jim Donovan and his negotiations. It's interesting including the details of his catching a cold and the state of Berlin after the War but it sacrificed the broader picture. I think they could have shown the impact of the incidents on the relationship between Heads of State Eisenhower and Kruschev. Next, the shooting down of Power's plane was exciting but the movie should have shown him getting caught on the ground and paraded around Russia on TV. Thirdly, I wasn't sure how Abel was spying apart from the coin paper and how he was caught. Not very clear. Also I don't know if the silly student really got held up because he was so whipped about a fraulein but I found it so irritating that the whole negotiations could have been ruined by a silly infatuation. Leave him in East Germany - he deserved it considering what was at stake.The movie really plays the unsung hero card making him scorned by the public and his ungrateful boss (as always Alan Alda plays a schmuck to perfection). Mark Rylance is effective as Abel. Austin Stowell makes a suitably stunned looking Powers.Bottom line worth watching as a timely warning not to get into another cold war but the movie could have been better.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","rooee","24 November 2015","Amidst the megahits of Q4 (is winter the new summer?) comes this quiet sleeper from Steven Spielberg. It's a chamber piece defined by soft words and silent gestures. Even the true story upon which it's based is a relatively unseen bit of history. Although it's such an interesting story, you wonder why.You've seen the big beats in the trailer. But this is a movie of details as tiny as the secret messages that unshakeable Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) receives on the sly. He's captured and fast-tracked through the American justice system. Insurance lawyer Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) represents him, but he's powerless against a guilty-by-default verdict.Then the Ruskies capture a US spy and an American student. As a US citizen ostensibly representing no one but his clients, Donovan is bunged off to a divided Berlin to negotiate a swap: one Russian for two Americans. The devil's in the detail – and, as Donovan discovers, there are so many damned details.Spielberg is cinema's top craftsman. We know this. But he does little here to draw attention to that consummate skill – and I mean that as a compliment. The ""quiet camera"" of Lincoln continues. And as a story it's as much a humanitarian one as Lincoln, although the script here (sharpened up by the Coen brothers, who are presumably to thank for the plentiful ironic humour) is less labyrinthine, less grandiose. More on-the-nose.So is Thomas Newman's music, sadly, which sounds like one imagines a Spielberg movie should be scored, all sugary clarinet softness. It jars with the austere Cold War mood and only really making sense in the final scenes, where a creeping schmaltz lurks. The Lives of Others this ain't.That's not to belittle the human emotion the film possesses, which is mostly convincing. Abel's ""standing man"" speech is a keeper. But beyond that, Bridge of Spies is a film of Big Themes: what nationality means; what professional duty means; and the arbitrariness of national borders. Donovan is genuinely baffled by the hypocrisy of his superiors, regarding Abel as merely a human being doing a job – the same job many US spies are asked to do.Rylance, subtle and dignified, is a shoe-in for a Supporting Actor gong. Hanks, meanwhile, makes it look effortless, somehow forging a relatable everyman out of an iron-nosed lawyer. These are actors at the top of their game.Intense, involving, and intelligent: if you're looking for something patient and quietly moving at the multiplex, look no further. It might look like minor Spielberg, but it's a major dramatic success.","2/10"
"Bridge of Spies","zephyrnewyork","20 February 2016","I saw Bridge Of Spies with friends last night. It's a Spielberg film, so outstanding cinematography is a given.The plot isn't 100% historically accurate (as are most, if not all ""based on a true story"" films), but it is still very good. Every American, every citizen of the former East Germany and West Germany, every citizen of Russia or any former republic of the Soviet Union, such as Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan, Estonia; every citizen of a former Warsaw Pact country such as Romania, Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, Albania; MUST SEE this movie, especially those who weren't old enough during the Cold War. Life in our countries was very different during the Cold War. Many people, young and old alike, didn't live long enough to see the end of the Cold War, or the demolition of the Berlin Wall, because they were killed. Many families were separated or forced to relocate during the Cold War. Some of us served in the armed forces then and are known as ""Cold Warriors"". Some of these people might've been your relatives or friends of your family.The film depicts a part of the life and the negotiations of an American attorney during the Cold War and how tense things used to be. I felt the tension as Tom Hanks' character did his assigned and delegated jobs in the film. I have a better appreciation of life today as compared to the Cold War because of this film.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","scottshak_111","19 October 2015","Steven Spielberg comes up with a biography of a guy caught up in the jaws of political torture as he endeavours to negotiate the rescuing of two people in a cold war struck world. However, the movie isn't limited to that. There are melodramatic bits strewn all across in the gravy of one helluva screenplay which is brilliantly topped by a stellar cast.Bridge of Spies is an exceptional movie that has been helmed slowly, delicately and powerfully. There was a war going on, a colder one: a constant mental war of superiority between the two superpowers on the globe. In a twisted world like that, Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy ends up becoming a victim to the US-Russia distress claws. To save his ass, a lawyer by profession, James B. Donovan, played marvellously by Tom Hanks, is hired with hopes of giving a fair trial yet a subdued one to cover up the hoopla. What ignites as an unfair trial gradually tangles him up further into an even bigger commotion wherein CIA approaches Donovan to make a barter of Abel for a fellow American spy pilot caught in Russia.Scaling back a bit further, the thing that might strike you as a pleasant surprise is its beginning. We witness an old guy painting himself with the aid of a mirror. His acts are quite mundane, natural and harmless. Spielberg spends enough time on the character for us to relate to him, a normal guy who loves to paint, who is calm and couldn't possibly mean trouble. On the contrary, we see a troupe of psyched CIA crowd bent on catching him. They bag him at an odd hour and bring chaos to his house, breaking all hell lose, without a search warrant. That's where Donovan comes in with his propositions. But unfortunately chaos swallows him up. It becomes James v/s America, as every guy starts hating him for fighting a case for the Russian spy.What was also great to watch was how people change their perspective. At one point it was manifested how the world leered at James when he was defending Abel, but then at a later stage when he saves two Americans, all that hatred ends up metamorphosing into sheer love. Mark Rylance is outstanding as Rudolf Abel. At times his expressionless face belies his indifference towards the political muck he ends up in. Even when he is aware of an imminent danger, serenity rarely leaves him. He carries his knack for painting and wears it even at direst moments. For example, he calmly answers, ""Would it help?"" when asked ""Are you not worried?"" One of the most brilliant scenes in the movie is when Abel compares Donovan to 'The Standing Man' in his story. The music grows suddenly and imparts extra gravity to the bit.It is always a delight to watch Tom Hanks act. His face carries the right kind of emotions. Always lost in thought, he makes Bridge of Spies a dramatic hoot. There are top-notch dramatic frames that Spielberg slides in for emphasis. Like the one where Donovan's son gets influenced by a war video, and fills up his tub with water for safety. It is a sad reflection of how war changes everything. Also, at one point Donovan had the misfortune of witnessing people being fired at whilst trying to sneak through the border. At a later stage, James sees children leaping over fences, which reminds him of the same troubled scene which then again throws him into the pits of gloom.What is a tad sad is how long the movie runs. The movie could have survived some cuts. There are frames that we could have lived without. However, it is comprehensible and justified to show crucial bits of the horror and mental torture Donovan had to go through in order to get the job done. When he returns home in the end, he dozes off at once owing to exhaustion whilst in the backdrop his family gets to know his greatness. Quite endearing to watch actually!A highly recommended movie.","4/10"

"Bridge of Spies","indiecinemamagazine","23 February 2017","The film ""Bridge of Spies"" set during the cold war is a collection of banalities including a predictable plot, mediocre acting and dull music. The screenplay could have been much more thrilling if the writers would have followed the main events in a more historically accurate way.The real life of James B. Donovan was much more exciting than the one depicted in the film. He was a lawyer at the Nuremberg trials and was already a well-known lawyer when he took the Rudolf Abel case. Donovan did not see Berlin wall escapees being shot; the shootings, which were the most similar to the ones depicted were those associated with the killing of Peter Fechter that happened the summer after the Powers/Abel exchange on the Glienicke Bridge.The real life stories of the spies of that period offer rich material for a writer, however the Coen brothers took the most uninteresting segment of the espionage story. The characters are bland and forgettable. This is an example of a politically correct propaganda film showing the good work of the intelligence services.The film ""Bridge of Spies"" is boring and disappointing – a naïve film made for a naïve audience.

"Bridge of Spies","lasttimeisaw","23 January 2016","Steven Spielberg's 27th feature film is a superiorly constructed retro-pigmented Cold War drama, inspired by the real-life happening of a prison exchange among USA, USSR and GDR in 1957, a fourth collaboration with Hanks, who plays our hero James B. Donovan, a New York lawyer, who is firstly appointed to defend a KGB spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance), and later, he is entrusted by CIA in negotiating the release of the American pilot Francis Gary Powers (Stowell), who is captured by Soviet Union during his spy mission, in exchange of Abel, which will be held in East Germany. Meanwhile an American graduate student Frederic Pryor (Rogers) has been arrested as a spy by GDR government, but in fact, he is innocent, out of his righteousness, James wants to change the 1-for-1 swapping to 2-1, insist both Powers and Pryor should be released, where CIA's only interest is Powers, so will everything turns out as James hopes?Spielberg sensibly enacts a more true-to-life depiction of the espionage activity in the movie's slick opening, from the Hollow Nickel Case, Abel is introduced as a phlegmatic and practised old- hand, who can steadily erase the evidence while FBI is rummaging his room, and Mark Rylance, a UK thespian, whose theatre achievement is overwhelmingly distinguished, proves that he can upstage Hanks without steeping into theatrics, his portrayal of Abel as a docile, reasonable and undaunted figure leaps out to be the takeaway of the entire movie, with his offhand epigram towards James' impromptu questions like ""are you afraid?"" or ""are you worried?"". ""Does it help?"" shows his much prepared devotion to his dangerous cause, which is also the reason why he is able to win over James' admiration.Hanks acts in his very comfort zone, being an overall good guy, like his previous effort in Paul Greengrass' CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013), his goody-goody persona, aka, a standing man, has become quite weary, this is where dwells my major beef about the film, the script (with Coen brothers on board) conveniently establishes James as a textbook example of safeguarding the basic human rights without mining into his own inner struggle, as if from the very first moment, he is set about to be the unyielding fighter, against all odds of being the public enemy No. 2 to defend a so-called traitor, even after his own house being attacked, there is no single doubt ever flicking over his complexion about whether he should proceed this taxing case. More excruciatingly, he is also the one who miraculously persuades the jingoistic judge Byers (Matthews) from making a death penalty verdict to Abel by foretelling a possible prisoner-exchange would benefit from keeping Abel alive, and single-handedly accomplishes the tough deal without any assistance (he cannot even stay in the Hilton hotel) in Berlin. Everything tastes like an in-your-face American government propaganda of individual patriotism and the tropes are rather banal and a bit disappointing from Spielberg and co., e.g. the intentional juxtapositions of two disparate treatments of captives between USA and USSR, and an overlong shot of the hand of the GDR lawyer Vogel (Koch) after being denied for a handshake after delivering Pryor.But then, fairly speaking, the film is a stunning accomplishment from the production team and a captivating political drama which reflects the highest quality of Hollywood filmmaking presently, nominated for 6 Oscars this year, apart from BEST PICTURE and BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY, the other four are well-grounded (BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR for Rylance, BEST ORIGINAL SCORE, SOUND MIX and PRODUCTION DESIGN), but one might highly suspect it will go home empty- handedly.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","SvetoslavGrigorov","17 January 2016","OK, Bridge Of Spies. Long (141 mins) and boring spy thriller with the usual performance from Tom Hanks (James Donovan) who's face throughout the middle of the movie looks like a carrot due to the the bad makeup and in the other half has the usual-suspect- grimace if he is having a poo because of too much effort trying to convince us with his tricks in a particular scene. The story is ...hm ""based on a true story"" which can't save it from superficiality. Mark Rylance who plays Rudolf Abel is much more interesting/convincing as an actor but also struggle in the adapted screenplay so whoever did it better not do it again.The Iron Curtain/Berlin Wall is very much Hollywood and you have seen it in many other movies so you are already prepared for it and will not surprise you.

"Bridge of Spies","dromasca","23 December 2015","So after sharks, dynos, extra-terrestrials, WWII, Holocaust, Olympics terrorism, future, Lincoln and handful of other themes, it's the turn of the Cold War to be processed, re-created and brought to screen in the vision of Steven Spielberg. 'Bridge of Spies' inspired by the historical character of James B. Donovan, defender of the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and then main negotiator in the spies exchange that set him free for the US pilot Gary Powers downed while in a mission over the USSR, is also the first movie in the political thriller genre directed by Spielberg.Had the script of this film been written by Ken Follett or the late Robert Ludlum, I would probably have accepted much easier the outcome. However, when brothers Coen are two of the three authors of the script I would have expected more than a smooth narrative structure and well written dialogs (in many moments). There is almost nothing of the sparks or daring insolence of many of the scripts in the films directed by the two. The story is roughly divided into two parts, and the tentative to synchronize the two threads (Abel's story and Powers' story) fail not only because they were separated in time by five years but also because it is only the first that has interesting material and consistency. The lawyer who does the right thing defending the rights of a criminal who presumably caused harm to his own country in time of what some perceived as war is too gross an analogy to the contemporary fight against terror viewed from a liberal point of view. The second part is more like the classical East Berlin spy stories, but here again the schematic description of East Berlin and of the Eastern German policemen and even officials lacks authenticity and complexity.We are left with enjoying two formidable performances by Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan and especially by Mark Rylance and Rudolf Abel. I am looking forward to the nominations for the Academy Awards and I hope that Rylance will get at least an Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. His act here is my favorite from all 2015 movies I have seen until now. On the other hand the political messages that this film tries to convey are much too obvious. Yes, they are important, but important messages are not well served when the style gets that close to propaganda. Actually the genre this film is closer than other is the Western. One lonely hero fights for justice against the whole world and wins against all odds. It's just that the century is the 20th and the hero is not using his gun, but is a lawyer. Problem is that the analogy does not work very well in this recent film of Spielberg.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","ctowyi","15 October 2015","The missus asked me what I wanna see this week and I replied: ""what else, the Spielberg-Hanks one"". This collaboration has always been a marriage made in film-heaven. Yes, I even adore The Terminal. But I don't know about this latest one. My wife dozed off a few times and the dude sitting next to me slept through most of it.The story is based on the true-life tale of James Donovan (Hanks); a lawyer who was pushed headfirst into the Cold War during the 1960s when he had to negotiate for the release of downed U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) after the airman was shot down over Russia.The title refers to the popular Cold War nickname for what's now the Glienicke Bridge connecting East and West Germany at the time the film is set. Its official name then was the Bridge of Unity, but it garnered its alternate moniker due to its notoriety as a prisoner exchange point for Western and Soviet powers.This Cold War story is certainly ripe for a rip-roaring cross-country yarn but Spielberg went for a sweet classical tone instead. There is a certain elegant sheen to the proceedings and the film poses deep ponderous questions like what makes us citizens of our countries. Hanks' nobility shines off like a light from a candle in a dark room as he takes up the job that nobody wants. The spycraft is captivating and absorbing, and when I say spycraft I don't mean Bourne or Bond. Dead drops are meticulous affairs. Gadgets are giant cameras installed on the bottom of light-weight aircrafts and hollow coins with a poisoned pin for instant death inflicted on oneself by oneself. It is all good and fine but the film couldn't engage me totally with its lack of severity and tension.For me, the film worked best when James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and Rudolf Abel (Michael Rylance) are sharing a scene together. Abel's face is impenetrable, yet it is filled with the weight of histories and subsumed patriotism. There is a scene in which he opens up to Donovan that is absolutely haunting. The moment the movie just focuses on Hanks it loses me. There is nothing wrong with Hanks. Hanks is just playing.... Hanks for the umpteenth time. You know which Hanks I am talking about... he is the cleverest man, the perfect man in the whole world. He bounces up from setbacks with a dusting off of his pants. You know he will save the day. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with that. But it didn't help the cause of the character when he is depicted as the noblest Saint of Earth and all others are evil, vile and dumb. Where are the cat and mouse games and the battle of wits between the Germans, Soviets and this lone American knight in a shiny armor? Nobody stood a chance against Hanks, and to really drum it into you Donovan's Messiah powers, every American looks to him like he is the enemy of the state and the scum of the earth. I don't appreciate being manipulated like this, especially by a movie.Still, this is a handsomely made film with some superbly crafted scenes that will remain in my memory for a long time, like the building of the Berlin Wall scene. Spielberg's typical musical cues are a little too in-my-face for my liking, forcing me to feel a certain way. The narrative circles and probes, but it didn't manage to percolate. Usually Spielberg's magic envelopes me and makes me a believer, just not in the case of Bridge of Spies. The film resonates and beats with the sweet energy of a full orchestra with Spielberg-Hanks as the maestro, but like Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool's new manager, sometimes I prefer Heavy Metal.","9/10"

Idealistic lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) agrees to represent him, at a great personal cost to himself and his family. But as the situation escalates, and casualties start being taken on the Russian side, it builds to a dramatic settlement outside the courtroom that will test both sides.Hanks and Spielberg are almost like their own company, obviously an effective partnership that has produced a number of high quality, epic productions over the years. The first thought bound to run through your mind when you see the latest offering from them is: what can go wrong? And so, the third film in a row I've reviewed that's been about spies unravels before me. Artistically, it's everything you'd expect on the tin, two seasoned professionals doing their thing and delivering the goods. In the end, though, it's just a bit too under-whelming to be great.In a day and age of relentless, flashy, fast paced CGI spectacles, it is refreshing to see such an intelligent and intricate story up on the big screen, taking its time to unfold and present all the facts. The drama itself does need to be pretty compelling, though, and sadly Bridge of Spies doesn't always maintain the most exciting pace. Hanks himself is serviceable, but hardly gives the most stirring performance of his career. But then, the trailer promised a dramatization of a man who risks losing everything, whose endurance and sanity are pushed to the very limit, but the script just never really delivers this, just a slow, plodding trot to the end, so he hardly finds himself stretched.It's an undeniably well made, intelligent and generally involving affair, if you're willing to pay attention, it just could have done with a little more meat on the bones underneath. ***","8/10"

Jim argues about the legality of the search at Abel's place as there's no warrant; but he meets a dead end. Abel is found guilty of espionage, but the judge holds the sentence for another day. Visited in jail, Abel tells Jim that he looks like his father's friend who stood even after severe beatings. Jim visited the judge with his view of for Abel's sentence; that the judge shouldn't sentence Abel to die so he can be exchanged if suddenly a US spy gets captured in Russia. The judge decides to put Abel incarcerated, to public disagreement.Gary gets explained about the poison should he get shot down, which he eventually does over Russia. Jim gets a letter from Leipzig supposedly from Abel's family, so he brings it to him. Abel says it's a Russian way to contact him. In Russia, Gary's trial concludes The CIA summons Jim saying he's entrusted to negotiate an exchange of Abel for Gary. He has to act on his own, with no official government support. As Jim arrives in Berlin, complications take place as a US student Frederic Pryor is captured in East Berlin. Hoffman, now Jim's handler, tells him the Russians may switch Powers with Pryor. Jim goes to the Russian embassy in East Berlin supposedly to meet Abel's family lawyer, Mr. Vogel. Instead he meets Ivan Schischkin. He tries everything at Jim; sweet-talking to smoothly threatening; to get Abel and delay Gary's release. But Jim doesn't flinch; he even asks for both Gary and Pryor for Abel, though Schischkin insisted that Pryor is under East German authority. Next Jim meets Vogel who brings the East Germans voice, which demands the US parlays with them about Pryor, acknowledging them as a sovereign state. Hoffman tells Jim to sideline Pryor. Jim and Schischkin agree on the exchange place in Glienicke Bridge. Vogel backs down, saying Jim's selling the same thing to two parties. As Jim hitches a ride in his car, Vogel tricks him into spending a night in an East German jail. Hoffman accidentally tells Jim that the East German attorney general wants to meet him. But when they meet there's no agreement as Jim insists on his proposal; Abel for both Gary and Pryor. Hoffman gets angry with this, but as they wait eventually confirmation come from other side that Jim gets his way, although the East Germans want to exchange in Checkpoint Charlie. As they wait on the bridge, Jim keeps asking about Checkpoint Charlie. When the Russians arrive and both parties confirm identities, Jim asks to halt the exchange as he realizes the East Germans stall to see if the Americans go through while forgetting Pryor. At last the East Germans arrive and Pryor gets secured, so the Gary and Abel gets exchanged. Jim goes home and his family sees his name credited for Gary's release.The story contains great potential. A lawyer fervently defends his client despite obvious bias weighing the case, turning into a story of how a civilian managed to negotiate two-for-one prisoner exchange; this movie has its two major acts brimming with things to focus more on. Unfortunately, for me this movie feels like it lacks something. As a story about spies, the movie's first act looks more like a courtroom flick. It tries making it up on the second act, showing great visuals of Berlin on the early Wall era. But still the movie lacks much in suspense, a feat any real spy movie should have.The technicals in this movie work great wonders. The sets and props look very convincing. I very much enjoy the Berlin Wall train view as great never-been-done visuals. The scoring is also great as it supports in creating great mood for its scenes. The sequence when Pryor gets arrested is also great since as far as I know this movie is the first to show the Berlin Wall as it's being erected. The U2 shooting scene is also a great work as Gary's perspective view from his chute looks very beautiful.The movie did great in building up its mood and depicting the common anxiety in the Cold War era, particularly with the side scenes. Still, the lack of suspense really undermines the good things in this movie, particularly since this is a Steven Spielberg movie, who did great job in building the suspense in movies like Saving Private Ryan and Munich. The movie could also give more screen time for the second act to emphasize more on the spy aspect of the story, instead of balancing the courtroom drama and the Berlin negotiations.Acting-wise, the movie is a great work. As the main focus, Tom Hanks nicely measured his performance to be believable and yet still portraying Jim's persistence on his terms of the negotiation. Mark Rylance did well in balancing the performance as in one frame with Hanks. Austin Stowell and Scott Shepherd added nicely to the story angles. Sebastian Koch also did adequately to the story.My view for Bridge of Spies (2015) is it deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a so-so say from me since although it's a piece of great film work, still the movie lacks the suspense that the audience looks for in a spy movie.","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","CinemaClown","24 December 2015","Marking the fourth collaboration between Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks, Bridge of Spies is an elegantly crafted, cleverly narrated & sincerely performed spy-thriller from the esteemed filmmaker who, even in what can be termed as his semi-retirement phase, continues to thrill & surprise us with stories that may not be as magical as his best works but still make up for an enriching experience.Inspired by true events, the story of Bridge of Spies is set in the 1960s during the Cold War and follows an insurance lawyer who is recruited to defend a Soviet spy, to give the illusion of a fair trial which in actuality turns out to be completely one-sided. But when an American spy plane pilot is caught by the Soviets, he's asked by the CIA to facilitate the exchange of spies between the two hostile nations.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Bridge of Spies continues his recent fascination with setting a drama around historical events and is another masterful work from the notable filmmaker that's thoroughly captivating from start to finish. While the story is dialogue-driven, the film has the structure of a cat-and-mouse game that keeps the interest alive and is wonderfully anchored by sensible performances from its cast.Production design team does a splendid job in recreating the timeline its story is set in with all the necessary details in place. Cinematography follows the mantra that other dramas by Spielberg carry and brilliantly reflects the grim period with its slightly darkened images. The pacing is steady and top-notch editing ensures that only relevant moments stay in the final print. Also, it's is one of those rare Spielberg flicks that's not scored by John Williams but Thomas Newman does well to fill up the void.Coming to the performances, Bridge of Spies features a much mature & dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Alan Alda & others, amongst which Hanks & Rylance impress the most. Hanks is at his usual best in the role of James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer assigned to defend the arrested Soviet spy in the court and later helps in negotiating a prisoner exchange deal between US & USSR. Rylance plays the Soviet spy with effortless ease and owns almost every scene he appears in.On an overall scale, Bridge of Spies is a refreshing entry in the genre of espionage thrillers that's deftly scripted and confidently brought to life under Spielberg's assured direction & Hanks' reliable performance. The plot brims with political tension, has its own set of twists n turns, and is consistently gripping despite its lack of action. The year of 2015 has already seen its fair share of spy-thrillers but Bridge of Spies is definitely amongst the best ones to surface and marks another successful collaboration between Spielberg & Hanks. Definitely recommended.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","virek213","19 October 2015","The forty-five year period between 1945 and 1990 is one that the whole world knew as the Cold War. During that time, there was a huge struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union for control of how much of the planet should be free or under the yoke of the atheistic system that was Communism; and at several points, that war almost went from cold to hot. In the main, it was primarily a war of intelligence gathering; and the possibility of spies being captured on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain was always a possibility. Such an event is the subject of director Steven Spielberg's 2015 Cold War suspense thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES, the 27th film in this legendary director's career.Tom Hanks, who has made it his business of playing an Everyman, portrays the role of James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer who, in 1957, was thrown into the breach of the Cold War by being forced to defend a KGB agent named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) on three counts related to espionage activity. Although Hanks loses that case in court, Rylance is spared the electric chair because, as Hanks admonishes those in high places, the day may very well come when the Soviet Union might capture one of our spies behind their lines, and that a prisoner exchange might well be necessary.Three years later, in 1960, that very possibility comes to the fore when Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a U-2 pilot working for the CIA, is captured by the Soviet Union after one of their missiles downs his aircraft. Hanks sees a huge opportunity for both countries (neither Rylance nor Stowell have divulged anything to their captors); but this potential boon is tainted by the capture of an American graduate student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) on the wrong side of the newly-completed Berlin Wall in the winter of 1961. Hanks then gets a hard lesson in the bizarre nature of Cold War politics, as Rogers is being held by East German officials, and both they and the Soviets are on different pages when it comes to the Communist political playbook.With the help of some fairly cagey maneuvering on his part, though it is severely looked down by his fellow Americans in general, and his own wife (Amy Ryan) in particular, as coddling an enemy agent, he manages to set up the moment of truth for all three men on the Glienicke Bridge (the actual bridge that is known as the Bridge Of Spies) that separates Berlin from Potsdam, all of this without any shots being fired in anger.Given that these events happened half a century in the past, and that an entire generation has grown up not knowing what the Cold War actually was, almost any other filmmaker might have had a very difficult time making the story clear. But then Spielberg has never been just any other filmmaker, and, being part of that generation that did know the fear that life as they knew it could end in a matter of hours, he knew that this was a story with huge implications, both political and humanistic. BRIDGE OF SPIES is a masterpiece of tension and suspense, with Spielberg continuing to show the influence of Alfred Hitchcock in his work; and Hanks basically does a role not dissimilar to James Stewart in several of Hitchcock's classic films. The depiction of the Cold War is magnified in the way Spielberg depicts the way the Berlin Wall cut off both the eastern and western parts of that city, and how Soviet soldiers cut down those who tried to jump over the wall (not unlike similar scenes involving the Nazi death camps in the director's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST. Rylance gives a superb low-key performance as Abel, a man resigned to his fate whatever it is but willing to accept what comes from it, gaining a lot of respect from Hanks in the process. Spielberg also superbly recreates that horribly tense period of the late 1950s and early 1960s where America was at risk, probably less from its fears of the bomb than its own anti-Soviet paranoia.Because John Williams, Spielberg's long-time collaborator, was unavailable due to health issues, Thomas Newman, part of Hollywood's illustrious film scoring dynasty, stepped in to do the score for BRIDGE OF SPIES; and while it may not have the typical verve of Williams, Newman's score has a lot to recommend it, including the influences of both Shostakovich and Copland, avoiding the easy and (in some ways) expected patriotic cues. Sober and serious much of the time, but with the added wit and gravitas of Hanks' and Rylance's performances to keep the story from getting too grim, BRIDGE OF SPIES is another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces for Spielberg, especially in his collaborations with Hanks; and it is a film that reminds us that the Cold War, though a part of history now, is also still an important part of that history.","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Hellmant","13 November 2015","'BRIDGE OF SPIES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Steven Spielberg's new Cold War drama film; about an American lawyer trying to arrange a prisoner swap, with the Soviet Union. The story is based on the 1960 U-2 incident; it was written by Matt Charman, and the Coen Brothers (marking the second film in a row, that was co-written but not directed by the brothers; following last year's 'UNBROKEN'). The movie stars Tom Hanks (in his 4th collaboration with Spielberg), and it costars Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Austin Stowell, Scott Shepherd, Jesse Plemons and Alan Alda. The film has received rave reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and it's considered a likely Oscar contender, at next year's Academy Awards. I really enjoyed it.The film begins in 1957 Brooklyn, New York; where Rudolf Abel (Rylance) is arrested by FBI agents, and charged with conspiracy. An insurance lawyer, named James B. Donovan (Hanks), is hired as his defense. Donovan takes the job very seriously, despite a corrupt court system, and hatred from a biased public. Abel is convicted of all charges, but Donovan is able to convince the judge (Dakin Matthews) to spare his life; on the chance that Abel might prove valuable, as a bargaining tool with the USSR in the future. His predictions come true, when an American U-2 spy plane pilot (Stowell) is captured by the Soviet Union.The movie is extremely predictable, even if you're not familiar with the history behind it, but it's still very well made. Hanks gives another outstanding performance; and Rylance is very impressive as well, in his supporting role. The film is beautifully shot, edited and scored; it's classic Steven Spielberg (doing what he does best). I was especially moved by the movie, and teared up on multiple occasions. It's a must see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/f4ptmnmXTWE","8/10"

"Bridge of Spies","pranayjalvi","26 December 2015","Collaboration of Tom hanks and great Director Steven Spielberg created a huge hype for this movie and me too was waiting for this movie. I spent 1.5$ for this movie at a cheap price of ticket and went to theatre to watch this. There was nothing wrong with this movie as everybody acted well and Spielberg as usual directed a well deserved Oscar winning Thriller film. However the plot was too slow and I was feeling sleepy while watching. The story involves only on one thing, exchange between countries which I felt too dumb. However critics liked it too much and predicts it for Oscar. I felt the movie very slow and boring and so I would go with 2.5/5 for this Spielberg directed flick.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","matthijsalexander","9 February 2016","Absolutely genius.The problem with the slightly lower ratings is the lack of 'Hollywood' in this movie.Often one finds that cultural and historical pieces are undervalued as too many people, especially from the USA, have no cultural or historical sense.What makes this movie great it the calmness, the respect and the effort in not making it 'over the top'.Just right.

"Bridge of Spies","MLDinTN","18 January 2017","This is a movie about spies during the cold war. Main problem was the movie was well over 2 hours with not enough excitement or tension. Plot is Rudolf Abel is arrested for being a Russian spy, I guess he was but never really admits it. Tom Hanks plays James his lawyer. When an US pilot gets captured by the Russians, James makes a play to trade Rudolf for him. He does the dangerous work of even going to Berlin and meeting with Russian and German officials. He learns of a US student whom has been arrested in Berlin, so going against what he's told, he tries to bargain for the student also.So of course the 2 sides have issues, but in the end James is able to negotiate the release of both US detainees. FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but only watch it if you got a lot of time on your hands.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Screen_Blitz","19 October 2015","Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks collaborate once again this espionage thriller set in the 1950s in the height of the Cold War, a period of political tensions between many nations across the globe and a time when the United States facing threats of communism from the Soviet Union that ravaged on until the early 1990s following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Based on the true events, Tom Hanks play James Donovan, an American lawyer who takes on a daunting court case to defend Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance), who is suspected of being a Russian spy, much to the outrage of the public as well as his wife and children. When CIA U-2 Spy-plane pilot Francis Scott Powers (played by Austin Stowell) is shot down and captured by the Soviets, Donovan is assigned into a negotiation with Germany to exchange Abel for Powers who is held hostage by German officers. This film marks Steven Spielberg's first collaboration with the Coen Brothers who produced this film, though the lack of humor typical for the directorial duo make it difficult to tell.This film does a pleasant job with highlighting the key points of the Cold War conflicts. It accurately portrays the atmosphere and the paranoia of nuclear war that America dealt with during this period. After all, it is Steven Spielberg behind the camera, and his director appears to carry polished knowledge on American history as demonstrated in some his previous outlets. One of the Cold War's most crucial elements of paranoia is best demonstrated in a scene for an example where Donovan's young daughter is in school and her class is watching an instructional video on seeking shelter for when a nuclear explosion occurs, and you see clips of cities getting wiped out by nuclear explosions. It genuinely shows the emotions people felt when the United States was in conflict against the Soviet Union, and how the threat of nuclear exchange was dangerously high. The Coen Brothers' screenplay and the direction are very well accomplished here, at least for the majority. Spielberg ambitiously maintains intriguing story as it follows the perilous journey of the main character and his attempt to make a deal with the Soviet Union, a deal that can carry catastrophic consequences if gone wrong. And with a crafty hand like Spielberg, he manages to keep the plot moving at a fairly solid pace, even when the film gets a bit too talky at certain points. Though the story doesn't quite offer many elements of surprise or even emotional depth (especially for a Spielberg flick), Spielberg fuels in plenty of substance to sustain the plot on an intriguing scale. The biggest disappointment in the narrative department however, may lie in the anti- climatic (though nicely shot by Janusz Kaminski) ending as the story concludes in a fading light fashion rather than with a bang, but there are some fair goodies in terms of the acting. Tom Hanks leads a terrific performance as his character James Donovan who is written beautifully without feeling very lionized with heroism. Mark Rylance does a pretty swell job as Rudolf Abel, the antagonist character who is portrayed very humanly without falling victim to contrived villainous characterization. Bridge of Spies is one of the best film of the year and is definitely a must see. While it certainly isn't as memorable as Steven Spielberg's other works, its still very satisfying. This is also probably the best film you will see centered on the Cold War.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","jmoneyjohal","16 October 2015","Every life matters, we see Tom Hanks character, James Donovan repeat this dialogue again, and again, and not till the tear dropping climax do we realize why he says this. Bridge of Spies is probably my personal favorite film of the year, The combo of Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have made another masterpiece, this being there fourth collaboration. Both create an absolutely moving,inspiring, and tear jerking film. Spielberg is just pure genius, he is like a gift from the film gods, and Hanks gives another Oscar worthy act. Spielberg with the Bridge of Spies, promotes American nationalism, and pride in a very worthy way, he doesn't spread propaganda that we see in films like American sniper. He shows, that all American lives matter, that a man who upholds the American constitution for ever person whether they be a spy or not is the real American hero. One who follows orders like a robot is not always correct aka CIA agents. Spielberg also shows how American children where feed false fear mongering information/propaganda to instill fear for a enemy who wasn't there, they just wanted to make American Nationalists. But more on that later. In short Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks get ready for the Oscars.Story wise the film is about an Insurance lawyer based in Brooklyn New York named James Donavan, who is given a criminal case after years to defend a soviet spy during the cold war between the US and the USSR. The case is a open and shut one, the American government is ready to hang the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, but James is not going to let that happen, he wants to defend his client properly by upholding the American constitution.Even though he is found guilty in all counts of the charges against him, James somehow negotiates with the Judge to give him life in jail, and not the death sentence. While the CIA follows James for info on Abel, he goes to Supreme Court to get a retrial, he fails but a opportunity comes out nowhere. The soviets have captured a American pilot, Gary Powers who was spying in Soviet skies for the CIA and they want exchange him for Abel. The CIA send James to negotiate the deal in Germany (no mans land), where a civil war in ensuing. What happens next is what forms the rest of the plot.Acting wise Tom Hanks is at it again with another masterful act, he makes the character his own, and leaves you in awe. The climax scene when he is watching Abel getting shoved in the back seat of a Soviet car, is pure genius and evokes tears. Mark Rylance is brilliant as the Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel. The rest of the cast are good in there respected roles.Bridge of the Spies is based on a true story, and Spielberg makes sure he tells the story as true as possible. He shows the good, bad and ugly side of America during the cold war, the film has no biases at all. He shows a man upholding the American constitution for an Soviet Spy, and he also shows how American children were feed false info to be made American Nationalistic robots. He showed how the CIA had there own agenda, and didn't necessarily care about American lives. The American stance against Germany during the Berlin Wall (East and West Germany)is also shown .In short Spielberg has got his facts almost 100% correct. And in a film like this that is of utmost importance. He doesn't take his audience for granted. He instead shows a powerful, moving drama, about one man trying to save American lives during the cold war. At many instance Bridge of Spies will leave you laughing,stunned, and in the climax you will be moved in tears. The films is an emotional journey of a true American hero James B. Donavan, who went from the most hated man in the USA, to an American hero. He is an American hero, and even I salute you good sir. This is the one of the most accurate, and positive films made on American history. The film is technically sound, its shot beautifully through America, and Germany in the 60s era, and the BGM is excellent. Kudos to the Cohen brothers for writing a brilliant screenplay and script. For me the film has no blemishes, but viewers may be for warned Bridge Of Spies is no flashy, no brainier entertainer, its a film made for a mature audience, who relish good cinema.Overall Bridge of Spies is nothing short of a masterpiece, Spielberg does it again and his resume and Oscars speak for themselves, but he proves his worth again, with this moving tale. In short if you want to see one of the years best films, don't wait,run to the theaters.4.5/5* or 9.3/10","10/10"

"Bridge of Spies","billygoat1071","19 October 2015","Bridge of Spies centers a lawyer who gets involved on defending a Soviet spy during the Cold War, meanwhile an American pilot was captured from the Soviet Union after a failed infiltration mission; having both sides even. This can be called a war movie, except it takes place in another side of the war; where we see people making decisions, having negotiations and such; might be recalling Spielberg's last film, Lincoln. Though some people may not be fond of the similarity, Bridge of Spies however manages to bring more humor and excitement within this journey. The plot remains rigorous, yet finds some real humanity, anyway. There are many reasons to get hooked into this film; from the story to the craft, whether it's big or small, the entirety is just excellent.The opening is already impressive, having a wordless prologue showing what this Soviet spy does in his job, hidden behind his innocent mannerism and appearance. It's simple, but tense and catches your attention, filling you with intriguing questions about this man's work. And then we cut to James Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is supposed to help this spy who was just captured and becomes a notorious man for defending an enemy of the nation. But things get tougher when he gets on an espionage, and then there's more. Despite the plot goes through a lot of directions, it never gets tedious and that might be because it's brought with some levity and sharp writing. But of course, the movie is on point with its theme. Basically acknowledging that no one is particularly good or bad in this war, both nations are having the same struggle, except Donovan strives to represent his country better by not only defending their spy, but also defending his own nation's integrity.And ironically, the Soviet spy happens to have more empathy in this film compared to the American spy. He can still be a threat for handling information, but he is actually a quiet old man who isn't afraid of anything. And his small moments with Donovan are instantly winning, mostly by its profoundness. In the midst of people arguing how to retrieve back their spies as safely as possible, the viewers shouldn't be worried by a stick-in-the-mud plotting, because the film hints with subtle humor. But of course, there is some suspense to be seen, as well. The opening is just the most interesting for its sense of mystery; the rest of the set pieces are just tension of people probably getting into trouble.And these scenes won't be as effective if it weren't for Steven Spielberg himself. The smaller scenes are obviously gripping and given warmth when they needed to, while the larger ones have brimming spectacle. The overall imagery always look great due to its stunning cinematography. The Coen Brothers, as the co-writers of this film, can obviously be noticed by the film's levity and some subtlety, as well. The acting is all predictable, with Tom Hanks being terribly engaging as James Donovan, but the more notable actor, Mark Rylance, brings a less showy performance, yet given something more to his moments.Bridge of Spies is stellar, simply by its craft and how it straightforwardly retells this story. It doesn't necessarily try to heighten the stakes beyond than what's necessary, in which some viewers can be disappointed, but the movie offers something more earnest and riveting. There is still a fine dose of suspense, though it actually handles a variety of tones: there are moments of coldness, but there are also moments that lighten itself up; making each account quite affecting and most importantly, entertaining, in this case of these men finding better justice for saving each other's spies, during one of the toughest times in history. And it's all done much you would expect from these filmmaking and acting talents.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","donegalcat","24 March 2018","A well-made and acted but understated cold-war drama about the exchange of prisoners between the USA and the USSR in Germany.Tom Hanks is reliably good as the insurance lawyer James Donovan, drawn into cold-war intrigue, representing a Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in court. Mark Rylance gives a quiet, understated performance as the spy. Rylance is competent, but the performance is rather a surprising nod for an Oscar.After an American spy pilot is shot down over Soviet air space, much of the film is set in Berlin as Donovan negotiates with Soviet and East German authorities for the release of the pilot and an American student captured in East Berlin in exchange for Abel.The scene where the pilots plane is shot down, is poorly filmed with cheap special effects. But otherwise the film is well shot with excellent period detail and atmosphere. Although some of the scenes in East Berlin verge slightly on absurd, a hint of the Coen brothers influence as screenwriters for the film.Amy Ryan is largely wasted as Donovan's wife while the early scenes detailing Abels court case feel a bit short and underdeveloped. And the final scenes fall prey to Steven Spielberg's usual twee sensibilities. But overall, the film represents a decent notch in the well worn and capable partnership between Spielberg and Hanks.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","jtindahouse","11 February 2016","It's so nice to watch a director who's completely in charge of whatever it is he's making. Even if the end product isn't perfect or to your liking, you can still appreciate that you are watching a master of his craft at work. Steven Spielberg will always be one of those directors. It helps he always works with an incredible team and has amazing actors at his disposal to direct, but the fact remains his name alone is always a stamp of quality. 'Bridge of Spies' isn't perfect, I have very little interest in the Cold War, the story itself within the war did very little for me, and yet it was an absolute pleasure to watch. A sure sign of class. The film has been nominated for Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. I think the nomination surprised some as it wasn't Spielberg's finest work, and it was missing some of the ""neccessaties"" when it comes to getting a nod, like a compelling love story (you could say there was one but you'd be stretched to do so). Films that are considered lucky to get a nomination are never any shot of actually winning the award, as they are just supposed to consider themselves lucky to be there in the first place. So sadly you won't be seeing 'Bridge of Spies' take home the award. A well deserved nomination nonetheless.Also nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role is Mark Rylance. Rylance blew me away. He has an amazing ability to appear as though he's not trying in the least bit, and yet at the same time completely steal a scene - even from the likes of Tom Hanks. The Coen Brothers, along with Matt Charman, wrote some terrific and Oscar worthy dialogue for him to deliver admittedly, but it was no doubt him that brought those words to life. Everyone is going to have a tough time knocking Sylvester Stallone off his perch for the award this year but if anyone can do it I believe it's Rylance.The only thing really holding it back from being great is that it's a touch dry. I never felt any emotion towards any character throughout the entire film. That, along with the fact that there is very little humour anywhere in the mix, can make it a tough watch at times. The quality though makes it worth the price of admission. Nothing is done half-heartedly, the sets are astonishing, even set on the actual bridge the events happened on. Hanks is his usual charismatic self and Rylance is in masterful form in every scene he's in. It's probably not one Spielberg will be most remembered for when we look back in 50 years, but I'm certain he'll still be proud to have it on his résumé.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Benjamin-M-Weilert","19 May 2019","While at first I was skeptical for this film's Best Picture nominee status, as I was under the impression it was just given to it because it was directed by Speilberg and written by the Coen brothers, it did eventually win me over by the end. Of course, first it had to get through a Cold War version of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" before that, but once Tom Hanks' character got to Europe, things got interesting. Clearly, the direction and writing on this film is what gave it the nomination it deserved.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Dr_Coulardeau","31 March 2016","We all remember, from our history text books at least, the events from 1957 to 1962, the total hysteria of the USA about Soviet spies which had led to McCarthyism and the execution of the Rosenberg husband and wife. The fall of Cuba out of their zone or sphere of influence was a trauma they are just right now trying to put behind. The spying was primitive with those spying planes that had no chance what-so-ever to get through: the first one was the last one. On both sides they ended up with spies in their prisons kept nicely warm to be used in some political negotiations as leverage. Consider the case of a Soviet spy in New York and that of an American pilot of a spying plane shot down over the USSR, plus the fact that East Germany turned tricky and led to the construction of the wall, and to top it all like the cherry of the cake one naïve American student preparing his PhD on communist economic policy in eastern Europe was at the wrong place at the wrong moment and got arrested and prosecuted as a spy by the East Germans. But the East Germans hated the Russians who had for sure liberated them from Hitler, but who had also destroyed Berlin in the most ruthless way possible, though the Palace of the Hohenzollern was pulled down by the East Germans. Tricky situation indeed to negotiate the release of two Americans, one of whom is a real security risk in exchange of one Soviet spy. And it took some time and a lot of patience, including against the CIA who only wanted to recuperate the security hazard out of Soviet hands before he cracked. It took a lawyer from Brooklyn, a pure Irish descendant to manage to bridge the two or three divides to get what he wanted. All those among you who have actually lived this period will remember the stress, the danger, the fear amplified by what the film does not tell: the Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961 and the Soviet missile crisis in Cuba in 1962. We went through a few years of absolute scare about the possibility of a nuclear war.We can measure the immense change we have been through: reunited Germany; united Europe (nearly finished though Russia will always be on the side); free and emerging Vietnam; China the second economic power in the world; apartheid gone with the wind; Cuba accepted anew by the USA; the banana republics of South America also gone. And yet the dangerous places have just moved to other areas and mostly because of the dumb policy of one US president who decided to solve the problem he had with his own father by proving to the world the USA could create havoc in the Middle East, and they did. And North Korea is the answer of the shepherdess to the shepherd: a perverted and fouled love song that prolongs the Korean War that was a total failure in the objective of the time to get Mao Zedong and the Communists in China down. Is the world really a better place today than it was in 1957-1962? You have to be naïve to believe that. The main difference is that spying is no longer that crucial and it has been replaced by the protection of intellectual property against pirating. Pirates and Hackers are the two plagues or our modern world. More than ever the danger is no longer from the outside but from the inside. Let's move our minds and backsides a little bit and let's clean up the mess Bush Jr. did and all European countries, especially the super-duper secular ones who pretend that everyone has the right to be a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian, or whatever, provided it is kept absolutely invisible in the public sphere, are today confronted to the bill.Dematerialization and castration of at least two generations of immigrants in Europe from previously colonized countries, which means at least three, four or more centuries of colonial alienation, exploitation and extermination when necessary leading to uprooting them from their countries and transporting them into countries that refused to recognize and respect the fact that they are different. As the fundamentalist secularists would say: ""They can believe in what they want provided I do not see it."" And the hazardous population is not outside but inside our borders. We have walled them up in our backyard without any rights whatsoever as for opinions and religions.The old Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome we all in Europe inherited from centuries of wars and the two world wars was turned into a Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome called the Cold War and we are still in that mood. We see the danger outside when it is inside, and not inside our territory only but inside our minds. The new situation is that the PTSS of the Cold War is confronted today to the Post Traumatic Colonial Stress Syndrome of the uprooted millions of previously colonized people who we have brought in our countries for salaried slavery. And we think that by mocking the religion of these human beings who are suffering in their inner essence we will free them of their PTSS. Only Charlie can be that dumb. I am sure that kind of anti-empathetic attitude would have turned the 1957-1962 situation into a holocaust. And that's the real danger today. The Islamic State will be defeated but what do we do afterwards? Cartoons of the Prophet dicing onions? And I am trying hard to remain polite. I guess some secular fundamentalists do think so. Papaoutai? Really this time. https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=oiKj0Z_Xnjc. Stromae help us out of this diabolical fix!Dr Jacques COULARDEAU","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","sujanfaster","28 November 2015","There are two sides two Steven Spielberg. One- Making magnanimous movies with big budget and special effects, Two- Making history come to life with classic film-making. Bridge of spies belongs to the second type. Based on true events, Bridge of Spies tells the story of American Lawyer, Jim Donovan in two parts. The first part is where he tries to do his best as a defense lawyer for the alleged Russian spy Abel and the second part where he negotiates a prisoner exchange with Russians and Germans. The film has two different flows. But, one cannot argue over the shift in the storyline as it is based on real events and it is best that Steven Spielberg has kept it that way. Very well written dialogues, subtle humour and great acting makes this movie, a masterpiece. Not too emotional, not too funny, not too dramatic this movie balances everything well.Tom Hanks, well there is nothing to say about him we all know he gives the best. But Rylance, with very few lines is the one who steals the show in this film. His role adds a whole new dimension to a grey character. Apart from these two characters, other roles are hardly significant. If you are looking for an out and out entertainment, this movies pace might disappoint you. But this movie is for the good cinema lovers. Who loves and admires a work of art whenever they see one.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","DanielRobertRoss","16 October 2015","I've been a huge fan of Spielberg for ages. Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, Minority Report etc. But the last few films haven't really done much for me. Crystal Skull really killed my enthusiasm for his films, and with the exception of Tintin, I haven't seen anything since that matches his best. But Bridge of Spies is a true return to form. Unlike Lincoln, which I thought was dull Oscar bait, Spies is a taut, exciting cold war thriller. John Williams provides another great score, the cinematography is excellent, and the film really captures the cold war paranoia and fear of those turbulent times. Parallels can be made between this film and the Bush administration, and at the same time not get bogged down in politics (Unlike the dry Amistad). This is a film that reminds people that the most exciting words on a movie poster are ""A Film by Steven Spielberg"".","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","agmoldham","22 December 2015","I have to confess to knowing very little about Bridge of Spies before the opening credits rolled. Going from the title and Tom Hanks presence was expecting a thriller, but it's actually a docu drama. The film tells the tale of events from the cold war. Like most docu dramas it suffers from the need to spice up a few of the real life events, but judging from other comments on the web most of the main plot lines are true.Hanks plays James B Donovan who is a lawyer hired to defend a Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). The film is always at it's best with the interplay between Donovan and Abel. A few of the scenes could probably have been dealt with a little more harshly in editing. As ever Hanks is always very watchable though, so it's certainly well worth a watch and gives a sense of what life was like during the cold war.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","jrarichards","17 October 2016","If the basis of a good film is a good story, then it shouldn't be too difficult to make a success out of the real-life (1962) exchange of (British-born) Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for American spy-plane pilot Francis Gary Powers and American student Frederic Pryor, all the more so given the background of the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the events leading to Abel's capture in a ""Reds Under the Bed""-obsessed 1957 America.But ""Bridge of Spies"" does not make it very clear that its real-life events cover a 5-year period, and maybe that is as it should be. This is a film, when all is said and done, and it is as a film that it should or must be judged. Who knows if Rudolf Abel was as likable as Mark Rylance makes him out to be? Intuitively that would seem pretty unlikely. And indeed perhaps even Tom Hanks's lawyer for Abel's defence - James B. Donovan - was not quite the ideally noble character we see.It matters not in the work of art that is this film.The ever-so-slightly Nixon-like Hanks looks like he's been extracted physically from 1957, and indeed immaculate authenticity of US setting is a hallmark of the film. And - having been born in Poland in 1959 - Janusz Kaminski on camera needs no lessons in how to make the Eastern European scenes look as they should. Thomas Newman's score adds greatly to the effect, and there are enough 2015 nuances in plot-lines and script to hint to us (I think rightly) that the division of the then world into US angels and Soviet devils was almost but not quite that.Indeed, a joy of the film (if not for the first time in cinema history) is the way it depicts (again one assumes realistically) the way in which East and West did have to find some ways at least of ""getting on"", even if only for pragmatic reasons, and - let's face it - to ensure that the bombs were not actually dropped, in spite of all the rhetoric. They were not, so somehow it worked...While supporting cast members like Alan Alda, Scott Shepherd, Sebastian Koch, Peter McRobbie (in an excellent cameo as Allen Dulles) and especially Mikhail Gorevoy (as the KGB man) all do great things in parts that paint in that authentic background, this is ultimately the film of the Rylance-Hanks pairing, and this is inspiring and interesting, and offers the chance for a surprising amount of wit and wisdom, and indeed warmth.Indeed, this film has a particular cosy feel about it, which scarcely seems warranted - given the circumstances - but is quite tangible and imparts huge watchability to the movie. Not for a moment do things drag.Ultimately, that enigmatic ""cosiness"" presumably boils down to the fact that the Donovan we follow is left much to his own devices as he moves from East to West and back again, is regularly in danger (indeed even in his own home in America), is playing a potentially risky game of high stakes with very big fish indeed, but manages to do so successfully by simply doing his (lawyer's) job as best he can in a circumstance in which his ""best"" is pretty darned good. He somehow keeps himself out of danger, and although he is sharp and even at times wily, he is most of all just dogged; and he keeps (or chooses to keep) things clean, simple and straight when all those around him seek to make them dirty, devious and complicated. Given that the key concept in the whole film (put into words by Abel) is that here is a man who always stands up again no matter how many times, and no matter how hard, he is knocked down, that cohesively whole image is indeed conveyed by the film, and it comes over as remarkably refreshing, and surprisingly convincing.Those interested in the truth behind the story are encouraged to read about it at length, but that should definitely be done after the film has been seen and judged (and enjoyed) on its own merits, which are as a very impressive and enjoyable piece of art.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","PhantomMayHare","23 October 2015","Yes. I am a Cold War history buff and I am so glad someone finally made a Cold War film! Even better Tom Hanks stars in this excellent film. I love war films, but I find they usually get low ratings (like War Horse). This movie is a must see for anyone who enjoys good espionage films. I have to finally give a thumbs up to Spielberg for making a family friendly film (with the exception of some curse words which can be bleeped out).This is a must see movie! It's gripping and wonderful. I love how Spielberg portrays the Cold War era without making it to risky for those who still remember it. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job in the lead role. This is definitely one of his better roles and one that he will be remembered for. This is an exciting year for family friendly films from Bridge of Spies, Inside Out, War Room, Woodlawn and so forth.This is definitely worth your time. It's a beautiful film, true to history and not to risky.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","nmholland","27 February 2016","Bridge of Spies is directed Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks as James Donovan, an American lawyer that, in Cold War era 1957, is chosen to defend a captured Soviet spy named Rudolf Adel (Mark Rylance) in a court of law. He later is selected to negotiate a swap of sorts to trade Mr. Adel to the Soviets in exchange for an imprisoned American pilot, Francis Powers (Austin Stowell). This film is based off of a true story, and is truly one of the best films of 2015. I'm glad it's nominated for best picture.The best thing this movie offers is the directing. Very few films are directed perfectly, and this is absolutely one of them. The camera angles Spielberg utilizes are fantastic, and his ability to capture a whole conversation in just one shot is magnificent. The cinematography is also great. The cinematographer (Janusz Kamiński) did amazing at capturing the Cold War era, and the flips in between Germany and the United States are very distinguishable and impressive.On the contrary, the movie is long, and has about 2% rewatchability. Much like Spielberg's 1993 film, Schindler's List, the movie is a one or two time watch, and may be a two hour-thirty minute snooze-fest for action lovers. Anybody who comes to this movie expecting James Bond espionage will surely have a good nap. However, a film lover and admirer of the art of cinema will be on the edge of his seat.The acting is also great. Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance, as always, yet not very memorable, unlike Forrest Gump or Captain Miller (Saving Private Ryan). His character won't be remembered in twenty years or so, no matter the status that the film ascertains. However, Mark Rylance gives the performance of his career. Besides Stallone, Rylance is most qualified to acquire the Oscar. The only performance I really had a problem with was that of Amy Ryan in the role of Mary Donovan (James' wife). She didn't exactly do bad, but her ability to portray her disagreement with her husband in dealing with his defense of a Soviet spy.The main problem I had with this movie is everything having to do with the American spy, throughout the first 45 minutes or so of the film. It takes away from the intensity going on with Hanks' and Rylance's characters. Every time something suspenseful was happening, the film would switch over to Power's side of the story, which wasn't too interesting. His scenes were directed well, and acted well, so the blame goes to the jumpy script, although the Coen brothers (yeah, they wrote a serious movie) ultimately did well once the second act rolled around, and lifted the film up pretty high.The last thing I'll mention is the score. This is the first Spielberg movie in many years that is not composed by John Williams, and it shows. However, that's not a bad thing. This film has a really good score, and keeps the suspense up, in a style Williams doesn't often use. Not to criticize Williams; he's the best film composer working today, but the score is captured beautifully by Thomas Newman, this film adding to his collection of many other great films he's scored, such as The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and American Beauty (1999).Overall, Bridge of Spies is a great movie with a few nitpicky problems here and there. The acting is good, the script is good, and the directing is flawless. I'm going to give Bridge of Spies an A-, or a 9 out of 10.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Alanjackd","30 November 2015","I recall a time when SS would push the boundaries of film making. That was then.Whilst being a very good and well scripted affair it's not what you might call a thriller...no particular tension to speak of as even without a history lesson you know the outcome .All cast do a brilliant job and direction and production is top notch...I don't think I have ever seen a movie with more of a cold war feel about it...especially set direction..one would think it was filmed via a time capsule.Lot of talk of American propaganda but that's a lot of rubbish..everybody was scared at the time and were cautious.Just a word about tom Hanks...he seems to have found a director who knows how to get the best out of him...never rated him much till SS got him to act his soul out in "" Saving Private Ryan"".Mark Rylance runs the whole show with his beyond excellent portrayal of a paper soldier in a non contact war of mis-guided hatred and was a pleasure to watch.Not since Micheal Keaton in ""Birdman"" have I enjoyed such a performance.The only down is the direction was very safe and never gave the audience any real feel of threat or tension.All in all not a SS classic but well above average.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","griffolyon12","19 October 2015","Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have teamed up for the fourth time in their illustrious careers to make their latest film, Bridge of Spies. Few filmmakers could literally direct in their sleep, and Spielberg probably could do that, the same with Tom Hanks in regards to acting, thankfully both of them give it their all here and make Bridge of Spies a very polished film that, while is neither of their best work, is still well worth your time.Bridge of Spies tells the story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), a Brooklyn-based insurance lawyer in the late-1950s who took on the case of accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (a likable Mark Rylance). Donovan was seen as a pariah for doing his best to defend Abel to the letter of the law, but he was then recognized as a hero when U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), was shot down over Soviet Russia, and Donovan was tasked by the CIA to travel to East Berlin to negotiate a swap - Abel for Powers.Spielberg works from a script that was written by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, and the Coen influence is very evident throughout the script. There are scenes of high tension one second (all exquisitely milked by Spielberg), and then moments that disarm the tension with humor the very next (a place where Tom Hanks excels at), which is very reminiscent of Coen films like Blood Simple or No Country for Old Men. This five-way collaboration between Spielberg, Hanks, Charman, and the Coens, finds each of these exceptional filmmakers all pooling their collective talents together to make a film that plays to all of their strengths, and that is the main reason that Bridge of Spies is a cut above most films in current release. The fact that the movie may have too high expectations upon it, purely because of the prior resumes of all involved, does not detract from the fact that this is still a remarkable film that captures a moment in history where too few films have gone.The history of film is full of movies about World War II, but when it comes to the Cold War, it's been an area that has been vastly unexplored by Hollywood. This film accurately recreates the period when Cold War paranoia was at its height in the States, making this a fantastic history lesson as well as fantastic entertainment. The production is designed with exquisite detail, with Berlin in particular looking as if it leapt off the pages of history books, and it really reinforces how bad things really were during that period. In just the background characters alone, Spielberg could have probably made three or four other movies, all of which would be equally as fascinating, that is how insane this moment in history was, and it's why it should never be forgotten. On the technical side of things, Bridge of Spies is another Spielberg, Janusz Kaminski collaboration with stunning cinematography. The film uses muted colors, with lots of grays, blacks, and navy blues on display in the sets and costumes, while the cinematographer, Kaminski, utilizes a lot of wide angle lenses to mimic the looks of many Hollywood films from the Fifties. This film simply looks as slick and stylish as anything that Spielberg has ever made, and yet it very affectionately feels like a throwback to the movies of the era in which is this film is set. The feel of movies like Judgment at Nuremberg is very evident in many moments. Of course, while the movie is a technical marvel and a well recreated history lesson, what makes Bridge of Spies stick with you after seeing it is the character of Donovan himself.James B. Donovan was a very fascinating man. He defended Abel because he believed that if we just sentenced him to death for being a spy without any due process, how does that make us any different from our enemy? If we see ourselves as Americans as being the better men, then should we not show the world that we are? This kind of straight arrow character is a rarity in film nowadays, with Hanks really mirroring the likes of Jimmy Stewart and Gregory Peck in his performance, it's just that kind of role and he does it perfectly. Then there is Rylance as Abel, who plays him in a very quiet, controlled manner that really paints Abel in a poetic light. He was simply a patriot, who believed in his country and on top of that, was just an unassuming, nice man who actually befriends Donovan in an interesting way. It really goes to show that the bogeyman is not always the monster we make him out to be, and I think that was one of the main ideas Spielberg was wanting show with this film, and I believe he does so brilliantly.I give Bridge of Spies a 9 out of 10!","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","GManfred","28 October 2015","Just weighing in but with nothing new to add. I agree with other reviewers, it's a very entertaining film that's hard not to like. sometimes I am struck by that fact that Spielberg films often resemble Frank Capra films in that they uphold a high standard in filmmaking and don't always rely on naked characters and buckets of blood. In ""Bridge of Spies"", Tom Hanks has the Everyman role Capra used to employ. This one, in fact, is rated PG-13, which doesn't happen often in Lowest-Common-Denominator Hollywood.Tom Hanks never disappoints and an argument could be made that he is America's best actor. Here he is his old self, although a few pounds heavier than in previous pictures but an idealist in the James Stewart mold. Good supporting cast of unfamiliar faces and the story moves along at a good clip. It's all been said and I don't do summaries - read another reviewer for one. Very worth seeing, an oasis in a desert of crummy Hollywood movies.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","keithlovesmovies","22 November 2015","During the Cold War, U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is captured by the Soviet Union after his U-2 spy plane gets shot down. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, Powers' only hope is New York lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is recruited by the CIA to negotiate his release. Donovan then boards a plane to Berlin to try to secure Powers' freedom through a prisoner exchange. If all went according to plan, the Soviets would get Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), the convicted spy who Donovan defended earlier in court.I will say that the film is not as exciting as the trailer but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. There isn't too much action or suspense as the core of this film is based on conversations between characters. The suspense comes from whether or not the people on the other side will follow through with what they say and whether or not the situation in which the characters are in the middle of, The Cold War, will have an impact on the proceedings. But what had the potential to be quite dull was not thanks to the performances of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, the direction by Steven Spielberg, the score, and the cinematography that really captured the paranoia in that corner of the world during the Cold War. Hanks is great here as he was the only reason I saw this film. In his best role since Captain Phillips (I still think he should have been nominated for an Oscar for that one instead of Christian Bale for American Hustle). I liked him in this one because I found his character to be very endearing and very human. I also found that this went well when juxtaposed against the world he was in. Rylance, who I have never heard of before this, stole scenes as the Soviet spy Abel. He was very witty with a calm demeanour and who never let the situation get to him. He and Hanks had great chemistry which made their scenes together very entertaining. I just wish they could have had more scenes together as their storyline was only for the first quarter when Donovan defended Abel in court and a little near the end of the film during the exchange. The reason I say this is because the middle of the film was not as exciting to me since it dealt with Hanks being in Berlin during the Cold War and having his character negotiating for the release of Powers and also another prisoner Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers). These scenes were still good because of the great script by the Coen brothers and the acting by Hanks and others. They just just didn't have the same weight for me since the film chose to focus on Hanks's character Donovan instead of the characters he was trying to rescue so they came off as one- dimensional. I guess they just wanted Powers for what he knew but they still could have fleshed him out more than just in the one scene. Also it is evident that this is taking place during the Cold War but I wished I had more of a sense of that. In other words, they could have gone further with that idea as we never got to see ""how bad"" the Soviets and the Germans, who captured Pryor, were as nothing really happened to them (onscreen at least). Overall, this is just a great movie and one of Spielberg's best.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com","8/10"

As it is about a spy named Rudolf Abel played by would be Oscar shoo in, Mark Rylance, from the U.S.S.R. that is arrested and faces possible execution for espionage like the Rosenberg couple. But he shows no fear in what he is about to face. Still Tom Hanks who plays the noble and upstanding James Donovan the case falls into his lap. Despite the ridicule he is facing and possible loss of his job and even family.Still he will not take no for an answer despite being ""forced"" into it and doing the right thing over defending Abel, who says people like him deserve a proper defense.But the proper jury and trial the USA does not want in the height of the Cold War. But when a pilot named from the USA, Francis Gary Powers played by Austin Stowell is captured by enemy lines as the USA and the U.S.S.R are enemies during this war. He is also not given a fair trial the same way. So Donovan must work to release Powers and a college graduate student named Pryor, played by Will Rogers and trade in Abel to the U.S.S.R.It will be no cakewalk as he faces very adversary government people from the East Germany where they were building the Berlin War at the time and the U.S.S.R.

"Bridge of Spies","Philipp_Flersheim","30 May 2022","Tom Hanks plays James B. Donovan, a lawyer whom his superior asks to take on the defence of captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). To the surprise of everybody, Donovan does not just try to keep up the facade of due legal process but really attempts to get Abel off. Eventually he persuades the court that Abel is valuable currency, given that the Soviets may at some point capture an American spy who will have to be exchanged. Once this happens, the US government approaches Donovan to negotiate the exchange, which takes place in Berlin. 'Bridge of Spies' is a great Spielberg that in some ways is typical of the approach of this director to historical material: At the centre of the plot is an everday person - Donovan - who decides to do more than what is expected of him (first during Abel's trial, and then when he negotiates the exchange), and that America has people like him is one thing which makes it a great country. The care that has been taken with costumes and sets needs to be stressed. Literally everything is spot-on, from the way US and Soviet prisons differ over the S-Bahn carriages and the scenes showing how the Berlin wall is being built to the films that cinemas in Berlin are showing in the winter 1961-62 (for example 'One, Two, Three' - which back then flopped in Berlin - and 'Spartacus'). The acting is superb throughout, and 'Bridge of Spies' is beautifully filmed: Spielberg paid a lot of attention to the colour schemes that characterise scenes in the US and in East and West Berlin, with the US being far more colourful that dark blue-grey Germany. All in all this is an outstanding example of modern film-making - a world away from the propagandistic myth-making of for example 'Darkest Hour' (2017).","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","jboothmillard","21 January 2016","I saw this film reviewed on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, then award nominations were announced and this film got a good amount of them, I wasn't sure originally whether I'd want to see it or not, but I cannot ignore the films that get this buzz, from BAFTA nominated director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). Based on a true story, set in 1957, during the Cold War, lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who specialises in insurance settlements, is recruited by his firm to defend accused Soviet Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Mark Rylance, star of Wolf Hall). Donovan has never practised criminal law, after World War II he was formerly a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials, so the prosecuting attorneys, the judge, his firm and his family do not expect him to mount a strong case for Abel, Donovan becomes a hate target by many who just want Abel executed. Abel is found guilty of all charges and convicted, but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to 30 years imprisonment rather than execution, as he could be valuable to the USSR as a bargaining chip for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody, Donovan also appeals against the U. S. Supreme Court, presenting evidence that a search warrant was not issued during the arrest of Abel. This scenario does come into play, American pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) flies a U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union, he is shot down, captured, convicted and interrogated, then American economics graduate student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) visits his German girlfriend in East Berlin, during the building of the Berlin Wall, trying to bring her back into West Berlin, but border control stops and arrests him as a spy. The USSR send a message to Donovan, under a false identity, proposing a prisoner exchange: Abel for Powers, Donovan travels to Berlin to begin negotiations, he finds out about the capture of Pryor and is instead insisting on a 2-for-1 exchange. The CIA are only interested in the return of Powers, but Donovan negotiates for Pryor as well, on condition that there is no jeopardising of the Abel-for- Powers deal, however the East German government holding Pryor suddenly pull out, they are insulted Donovan did not inform them of the involvement of the USSR during the negotiation, the CIA want to leave Pryor behind, but Donovan threatens East Germany that the entire deal will be scrapped, Abel could talk, and East Germany would be blamed by the USSR for any damage. In the end, after long hours and patience, Donovan's efforts are rewarded, the exchange is agreed and takes place on the Glienicke Bridge and at Checkpoint Charlie simultaneously, Abel, Powers and Pryor are freed and handed over peacefully to the opposite sides, Donovan gains credit for his achievement. Also starring Amy Ryan as Mary Donovan, Scott Shepherd as Hoffman, The Lives of Others' Sebastian Koch as Wolfgang Vogel, Alan Alda as Thomas Watters Jr., Mikhail Gorevoy as Ivan Schischkin, Eve Hewson as Carol Donovan and Child's Play 3's Dakin Matthews as Judge Byers. Hanks in his fourth Spielberg collaboration as always gives a great everyman performance with stamina, Wolf Hall star Rylance is a great choice as the always calm mole-like dignified man,I was wondering if this film would be complicated or too political, and I'm thankful it wasn't, the real- life story about prisoner exchange and a paranoid climate is very interesting, with the backgrounds and costumes it feels authentic, it is an enjoyably patriotic wartime historical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Matt Charman, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen, Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Original Music, Best Sound, and Best Film.

"Bridge of Spies","SumanShakya","31 March 2016","Steven Spielberg is among the few legendary film makers who have made their prominence for the versatility in the subjects they bring through their films. On one hand, Spielberg had made a touching children drama ""E.T THe Extra Terristrial"" and on the other side gave ""Schindler's List"" documenting history, making it appear larger than life. His versatility continues even today with a touching movie like ""War Horse"" based on the children's novel or a historical movie like ""Bridge of Spies."" May that be 'Empire of the Sun,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or ""Jurassic Park,"" he always had the clarity in story telling and with ""Bridge of Spies"" it seems he is still unbeatable in terms of story telling.""Bridge of Spies,"" as has been narrated, is said to be inspired by true events depicting the cold war of 60s between the United States and the Soviet, during which an American attorney opts to negotiate an exchange between a Soviet Spy and an American pilot and a student. In a way, the film retells a segment of history which we haven't read yet. Whatever the film shows come very strongly and just touches you. An attorney who receives hate from the Americans becomes a negotiator for the US president explains a lot of our central character. in the role, Tom Hanks as usual gives a tremendous performance, which sadly went not nominated this time at the Oscars. But a face that catches your attention the most is Mark Rylance as a Soviet Spy, who won an Oscar for his performance. Even with the minimal dialogues he was given, he makes a prominent presence in the film, for which he deserved the award.Overall, just watch this film to know a part of history, or feel the extraordinary power of Spielberg's story telling, or simply if you're an admirer of Tom Hank's brilliant performance.Rating: 3 stars out of 4","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","bartonj2410","27 November 2015","Bridge of Spies marks the fourth collaboration between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks, a relationship that has gone extremely well thus far. Both of these Hollywood icons seem to bring the best out of each other and all things were pointing towards Bridge of Spies being another winner.Telling the story of James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer who, during the Cold War, is told he will be the defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in court, a man believed to be a Soviet spy.When the American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), is shot down and imprisoned by the Soviet Union, Donovan is then tasked with negotiating an exchange with the Soviets; Powers for Abel at a time when tensions were very high between the two nations.Spielberg is my favourite director and he will go down as one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema. Whether he's dealing with a summer blockbuster or a lower budget drama, Spielberg finds a way for the film to connect with its audience, and Bridge of Spies is no different.The sentimentality that can so often be found in a Spielberg film is usually the key component in that connection and it is ever present in Bridge of Spies, a film that depicts an event in history made possible by one honest man when some thought war was the only option.There were some rewrites carried out on the script, written by Matt Charman however, when you can call upon the likes of Joel and Ethan Coen to spruce it up a bit, you know you are going to get real quality. Every word feels like it counts and there were some genuine moments where I was thinking to myself, ""Yeah, these are the words of the Coen Brothers"", with dashing of light humour sprinkled throughout.Coming to the performances, there were two that, unsurprisingly, stood out for me. Of course, Tom Hanks is one of them, playing the spirited Donovan with a performance full of such wit and charm that he becomes instantly likable and a character the audience will be rooting for.The other is the performance from the lesser known Mark Rylance, an actor known more for his stage roles than his work in front of a camera. As accused spy Abel, Rylance shares a chemistry with Hanks that sees Donovan and Abel seem more like old friends than strangers who have just met. Spielberg was so impressed with Rylance that he offered him the lead part in his upcoming adaptation of The BFG, due next year.Weirdly, for a Spielberg film, the score was not composed by John Williams, who had to drop off the project due to bad health. Thomas Newman stepped up to the plate and, while he does a fine job, his score doesn't do enough to evoke the emotions the way a score from John Williams would.This isn't Spielberg showing off with a big special effects laden film, nor is it a film about spies that you may expect. Bridge of Spies is however, a riveting drama with two Hollywood icons in top form. You'd be crazy not to check it out.","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","statuskuo","18 October 2015","We're going to really miss Spielberg when he retires. IF he retires. This is craft to the highest form. And the attention to every detail is sorely lacking in movies. Craft is IMPOSSIBLE to relate to movie makers today, because it's when talent meets instinct. And we lack instinct.The story is of Tom Hanks who plays defense attorney James Donovan, that deals with insurance policies. As we're introduced in the beginning, he does what every defense attorney does, he spins the truth to meet his client's point. It's a little scheisty, but he's clearly effective. This gathers the attention of his boss, who assigns him the duty to defend an alleged Soviet spy. I don't even believe in due process, unless I'm bustedof course, but he is entitled to a ""fair"" trial. If that is even possible. The United States is under high alert in light of the Cold War (Muslims anyone?) and Germany is rebuildingsort of. With the freeze out of the Russians who've gone deep into secrecy. Were we ever friends? So, now we got a captured Ruskiewhat happens? Well, don't want to give away too much. But he is exactly how we imagine someone captured should act who comes from the Eastern Block. Cold, detached and resigned to their fate.So, now as advertised, we get a spy exchange. But who does it? The C.I.A. washes their hands of the issue. The State Department don't want to be involved? Well, they wrangle Donovan into the mission. Except, it's not a mission. Because if caught or killed Donovan is on his own. Because of the freeze out (literally) of Berlin, and the historical split to East and West, they aren't playing games.The movie isn't the most exciting. Espionage, in the truest sense, would most likely be a lot of waiting. But this moves at a really nice clip and because of craftyou watch every beautiful frame with anticipation of the next visual (beautifully shot on film by Janusz Kaminski).This is a movie that only professionals put together. The minute you watch, you know the people who made it are skilled. There is an easiness, practically effortless (looks like) storytelling. They let the moments between the family develop. The intricacies of our diplomacy made simple despite the thick fog of friends and enemies. A classy sophisticated movie. It's high art.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","gavinp9","2 January 2018","'Bridge of Spies' is an espionage thriller at its finest. It's set in the late 50s & early 60s and certainly looks the part - I always love seeing the old cars driving around New York, looking classy. Starts off like any classic spy film, but then Abel (Rylance) is caught. In comes Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who is asked to defend Abel, so he can receive due legal practice. The first 45min or so is a good courtroom drama and moves along fast enough, with Hanks giving a few great speeches and making some solid points about what's right and what's best.The movie really captures well the Cold War tension in America and what families would've gone through. It helps that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a few years and the best film Hanks has been in for a while. Once the movie turns into political chess, with an exchange of Abel for Powers (Stowell) in Berlin, the stakes are raised and there's plenty of great subterfuge.Hanks basically owns the film, with everyone having some good moments (especially Rylance, with his ""would it help?""s), but he really plays a great everyman who stands up to both Germany, Russia & his own country (mostly portrayed by the CIA/Shepherd) for what is morally right and just, not just what is politically acceptable at the current time.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","TxMike","6 May 2016","Watched it on DVD from our local public library.This movie has special significance to me, I was a teenager during the approximate 5-year period this movie is set, about 1957 through about 1962. I remember the news when Powers was shot down in the U2 spy plane over Russia and the cold war propaganda it generated.In this Spielberg movie, ""inspired"" by true events, Tom Hanks is insurance lawyer James B. Donovan. There is an arrest of a suspected Russian spy and the government asks Donovan to be his defense lawyer, allegedly to show the world that even a suspected spy would get proper due process. But it was clear (at least the way this script is written) that all that was wanted was a quick conviction.A critical move was to talk the judge into giving the spy a life sentence instead of death, he reasoned that maybe the spy would eventually talk, but even if he didn't maybe there would be a future opportunity to use him in an exchange.That opportunity came in the early 1960s when Powers was flying a high- altitude U2 photo mission over Russia but was shot down. After that the government asks Donovan to try to negotiate a prisoner swap, to get Powers back. This required him to travel to East Germany as the Berlin wall was being constructed. There is a lot of tension and close calls but the mission is accomplished, also with the release of a young 25-yr-old student who did nothing wrong but was studying Economics in Germany.Surely there are some things fabricated but overall it is a nicely entertaining movie based on real people and real events.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","gsygsy","27 October 2015","A solid piece of work by Spielberg and his collaborators. Tom Hanks, the James Stewart of our day, incarnates honourable American values but manages, in a way Stewart never would or probably could, to convey his awareness of their fragility. The business of holding fast to one's values in a challenging world is the spine of the film's message, dramatised in the relationship between spy Rudolph Abel and Hanks' character, lawyer James Donovan, in this tale of Cold War brinkmanship.Abel is played by someone who I have no hesitation in naming as one of our era's greatest actors: Mark Rylance. Very familiar to theatre audiences in the UK, he has appeared infrequently on screen. I have a feeling this situation is going to change as a result of his typically superb performance here. Watching him and Hanks play their scenes together was for me the film's main pleasure.Hanks is well partnered too in his scenes with Mikhail Gorevoy as a Russian diplomat and Sebastian Koch as an East German lawyer. Austin Stowell is excellently cast as Gary Powers, the American pilot whose capture reconfigures Abel's fate, and there are a number of other first rate cameos, including Peter McRobbie's turn as John Foster Dulles.The women have a rotten time. Amy Ryan has little to do but smile or worry as Hanks' wife. Nadja Bobyleva manages to make a mark with an emotional scene as the Berlin Wall is being built, one of the film's most chilling sequences.The film's stand-out sequence on the technical front is a terrifying plane crash, one of those jaw-dropping set-pieces that are hallmarks of a Spielberg movie. In this story there's not much room for another of those hallmarks - sentimentality - but where Spielberg can find it - mainly in the scenes around Hanks' family - he puts it in. Still and all, it's definitely worth going to see BRIDGE OF SPIES, not least for Rylance's masterclass in screen acting.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","leosmith-11166","22 November 2015","Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. When you have a duo like that making a movie, you know your going to be a little more than satisfied. Bridge of Spies is set in 1950s America and West Germany, and follows the struggles a lawyer has with an exchange of Prisoners.A lot of things add up to the greatness of this Film. Hanks Performamce is one. Another is how Steven Spielberg depicts the publics fear in the 50s. Another would be the beautifully cinematography. The Acting from Hanks, as per usual, is fantastic, and I believe he will be nominee for best Actor. Steven Spielberg also stays true to the original story, and does not twist fact and fiction. Bridge of Spies deserves all the praise it can get. With fantastic Acting and almost perfect direction, Bridge of Spies proves itself one of the finest Films of 2015.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","pelhamc","14 August 2016","Tom Hanks. Dreamworks Entertainment. Need I say more? This picture was corny. Bridge of Spies follows the true story of a Cold War era insurance lawyer called upon by his country to first defend and then later negotiate the exchange of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel, who looks and sounds weirdly like Sean Connery. Hanks (Mr. Mom, Sully) reprises his reluctant hero role from the Dan Brown series as Jim Donovan, an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances. It had that True Lies if-they-only-knew element to it. The KGB character was played sympathetically, replete with his own catch phrase (was that really necessary?). The closest thing this film has to an antagonist is Donovan's CIA handler. He's ""mean,"" because he doesn't abuse the trust placed in him the way Donovan does, changing mission prerogatives on a personal whim because believes he knows better. The object is an American student being held for sedition by the East Germans. Hanks wants to take him back. The Americans don't value him. So, Hanks hijacks his own hostage swap to make the kid part of the deal. Patriotism is one of the themes, along with loyalty and reputation. This film could have used more spycraft and intrigue. They could have done a lot more with the story. Suspense and courtroom drama were missing. The plot focuses on the character's personal life, without fleshing it out. Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone, Birdman) shines as the wife, but it's a bit part. Donovan's family bares the brunt of public scorn for his defense of an infamous foreign operative. Donovan seems to be stating nonverbally that they'll get over it, it's for the greater good, without bothering to even say as much, against the backdrop of 20th Century nuclear fear. He's sacrificing in strong silence. Or whatever.Bridge of Spies wants to be a ""message movie"" but the didactic is fuzzy, at best. In defense of Abel, Hanks cites the US Constitution. This raises the question as to how the Constitution applies to the case at hand? I must have missed the part dealing with the rights of foreign nationals to spy on America. Donovan avoids the question by simply circulating back to the Constitution itself. It is because it is. Logic is not met with logic. Donovan is not a fighter for critical thinking. Someone recently called Matt Damon the ""Jimmy Stewart of the generation."" I would nominate Tom Hanks for that dubious honor. Methinks Mr. Spielberg should get with the times. The classic formula is less relevant in today's marketplace of media and devoid of creativity. It's cheese with a side of schmaltz.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","edwagreen","17 January 2017","Someone will have to explain to me why Mark Rylance won the best supporting Oscar award for this very good film, especially in a year where Sylvester Stallone was well favored to garner the award.That being said, this was a very good film showing the efforts of a Brooklyn lawyer in going to Europe to secure the swap of Rudolph Ivanovich Abel, a Russian spy with Gary Francis Powers, the latter getting caught during the U-2 Spy Incident during the waning years of the Eisenhower administration.Hanks, as the attorney, is relentless that the swap must include the economics student who was studying in East Germany at the wrong time.

"Bridge of Spies","soman-kumarasamy","28 October 2015","Even though I am not American I found many interesting movies about history and biographical, but not this one. I went to this movie with great expectation of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks and the rating given for the movie, but the movie was below my expectation. I don't find ,much mystery,twist,thriller or interesting drama. The movie was just going on towards successful deal. The opposite parties involved in the negotiation with Tom Hanks are approving for all his demands after every second attempt. All looks very less complicated negotiations.Over hyped may be because of entities shown in the film are big or because of I already read about the incident depicted in the movie. But still there are many movies you will tend to watch again and again even though you read the story and watched already, this one not up to that level.

"Bridge of Spies","rannynm","14 October 2015","This film is nothing other than legendary and an immediate classic. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are back together again, to make another incredible dramatic and genius film. With historical facts, a heartfelt and dramatic story, this film is not only bound to be an Oscar contender, but I think this film may swoop any other film this year, and win the film of the year award.This is a drama. Although it cracks jokes here and there, it really is primarily mainly a dramatic re-enactment of an historical event. The story itself is a large adventure with action and intense scenes filled with various human emotions and unpredictable actions that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.The story starts in the middle of the Cold War, in Brooklyn. A man believed to be a Soviet Spy is arrested and, because of American law, he is supposed to get a fair trial. The man responsible for defending him in court starts noticing things and instead of just making it look like a fair trial, he actually tries to help this 'spy' get the right sort of action.I don't know how Steven Spielberg (director) does it but, he makes these stories come to life and helps you connect with the characters so that you cry, laugh and almost fall of your seat because it's so intense! The camera shots explore the scene from a variety of angles and go way beyond just showing one element. With each camera shot, you are prone to say, ""nice shot."" For example, in one scene, they are on a bridge and, instead of showing a sky high view as you might expect, he shows it from the prospective of the people. It is snowing; you can't see the other side or the people very well. You can just see a few lights and it is just so perfect. If you are a fan of Spielberg's work as I am, you will be happy to see some of his famous wide shots which help scenes seem to float into each other.As for the acting, Tom Hanks has done many roles and this is truly one of his best. He plays a character that does so many dangerous things and does them for a few people that he doesn't even know. He shows extraordinary skill portraying this character, bringing out emotions we can relate to. Full and heartfelt, with each scene his character gets better and better to the point that you are just sitting there with your eyes wide and forgetting to breathe thinking, ""What is he going to do next?"". When he is upset, you're upset. When he is terrified, you're terrified. He is perfect for this role and this is easily one of his best work.For this film, I cannot choose a favorite scene. Each scene is so important in its own way. Each scene is so spectacularly done. Each scene is so entertaining whether it's funny, intense or dramatic One of the scenes that was most impressive is when we see an American spy flying a plane, 70,000 feet over Russian territory. He is gathering intelligence and hoping to get some information about nuclear defenses. His plane is being attacked and the problem is, he was supposed to go down with the plane. The cockpit shatters and he goes into free fall. I love the scene because it looks like he is falling from 70,000 feet at an alarming rate. The execution of this is outstanding. It is clear and intense, which is why I love it so much.The subject of this film is rather mature like the scenes near East Berlin during the time the Berlin Wall was being constructed. A part of Berlin is cut off from food and everything else. There are many other scenes featuring the impact of the Cold War. Because of these, I recommend this for ages 11 to 18. I enthusiastically give it 5 out of 5 stars because this film is legendary. It is mind blowing in so many parts and, I believe it is one of the best films I have ever seen.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","KDPeffley-2","29 September 2021","This is on my top ten list for best acted and best directed films that cover our involvement in the Cold War. How can you go wrong with actors Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance? They are superb. And Spielberg's direction gives us a great mix of historical perspective and suspense, because frankly almost none of us living really remember the details of these events as they actually played out. You'd have to be 90 years old or a history wank to know what's going to happen, so we are given Tom Hanks as the lawyer James Donovan to guide us through those difficult times. Mark Rylance plays the Russian spy whom Donovan defends at the expense of his career, family and death threats. Rylance, who also played Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall, is completely believable as the honorable, dead pan, Russian spy who can't help but be admired, if not for being a spy, but for his gentle manner and humanity. Hanks and Rylance are most memorable, but the story never plays second fiddle. Mixed with the embarrassing events of the U2 spy plane, the backdrop of our fear of Russia, and the dreary, dark winter of living in East Berlin, we are given a perfectly entertaining account of serious times.","9/10"

"Bridge of Spies","Evan_Wheatley","11 April 2017","When the director of ""Jaws,"" the star of ""Forrest Gump"" and the writers of ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" come together to make a film, you know you're in for a treat.""Bridge of Spies"" is set in 1957 during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested by the FBI and charged with being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked by his partners to defend Abel in the impending trial. Donovan is ridiculed and scorned by his fellow Americans for representing and defending Abel, as many of them would rather see him hanging from a rope. However, Donovan's success in keeping Abel away from the death penalty proves vital in negotiating with the Soviets after they capture an American spy. Whenever I watch Tom Hanks, seldom do I see Tom Hanks. Whether it's Forrest Gump, Captain John H. Miller or Woody from ""Toy Story,"" Hanks consistently excels at becoming the characters he portrays, and he delivers a dynamic performance as James Donovan. The character is decent and kind, but firm in upholding the law and his personal values. Mark Rylance's portrayal of Rudolf Abel is Oscar-worthy. Abel is an awkward, mild-mannered and unusually calm elderly man, the last person you would suspect as a Soviet spy. In the face of potential execution following a guilty verdict, Abel remains cool and collected. Blown away by his lack of alarm or concern, Donovan questions, ""Are you not worried?"" to which Abel responds, ""Would it help?"" Ethan and Joel Coen's script dishes out the perfect comedic, dramatic and thrilling elements that make ""Bridge of Spies"" great. Its dialogue drives the story, and while this may turn off certain audiences, I found it enthralling. Fundamental themes of integrity, perseverance and standing up for what's right are broadcast clearly and effectively through the actions and words of the story's protagonists. Like most of his films, Steven Spielberg's touch is evident from the first shot. There are several scenes throughout the film in which two or more people are simply exchanging dialogue in a room. While on paper this may come across as dull, Spielberg keeps you engaged by positioning his characters in different places during a scene. Through this he is able to portray a variety of shot types and angles and simulate the effect of cuts that aren't actually there.Spielberg's narrative direction is as captivating as his visual storytelling. ""Bridge of Spies"" is based on a true story, and very little is altered or fabricated for the sake of entertainment. Aside from a few minor plot points and inconsistencies of the spies' time in captivity, Spielberg and the Coen brothers stay true to the intriguing story of how an insurance lawyer from Brooklyn saved the lives of two Americans and a Soviet spy.Novelty in today's cinema is a hallowed treasure. Unique scripts are replaced with unnecessary sequels and reboots, and dialogue-driven stories dwell in the shadow of the next Marvel blockbuster. Despite Hollywood's ever-growing lack of originality, directors like Spielberg continually restore my faith in filmmaking. ""Bridge of Spies"" breathes new life into historical thrillers, and is a must-see for lovers of the genre.","8/10"

Every single actor did their job incredibly well and could not be flawed.The story itself is very interesting and I imagine it was a very tough task to transform it into a movie but it worked so well done writers. Anyone can turn a large scale event such as Dunkirk, or Stalingrad but to turn something much more minor and make it give an effect ranking with them events requires true skill. ​Beautiful music to show tension, heart warming moments and even the brutality such as the train sequence, speaking of which was jaw dropping. The ending was so very well done and came full circle to the movies prior events though I feel the actual final negotiations could have been done a little better. ​Bad: The first act is quite slow and dull but it makes up for it after that. Some scenes could be taken away or cut down. Some subplots and minor characters such as the journalist, while possibly historically accurate, felt out of place and could have meant more if explored more thoroughly.

"Bridge of Spies","CinemaSerf","2 January 2024","New York attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is drafted in to provide what can only be described as a cursory defence for alleged Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) whom the establishment want to offer an ostensibly open and fair, but actually only a rather rudimentary, trial. This doesn't sit well with Donovan, and he manages to get the judge to commute the death sentence to one of thirty years. That proves to be visionary because shortly afterwards, US pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is off doing a little spying of his own when he is shot down over East Germany. Donovan is now drafted in by his government to travel to Berlin, without formal status, and see if he can't negotiate a prisoner swap. What now ensues is a true story that wouldn't look out of place in a John le Carré novel. Lots of dogma-driven mistrust, manipulation and a fair smattering of who needs to win the PR battle - especially complicated when the East Germans take a student hostage and he must now try to get both out - a two for one deal! Hanks is on good form delivering a measured and considered effort as the ingenious lawyer with a conscience, and Rylance also performs well, if really too sparingly, as the prisoner who is also a man of principle - though slightly less sure of the nature of his welcome at home should Donovan succeed. The film looks good, is nicely scored by Thomas Newman and we get a genuine sense of just how battered Berlin was as the wall started to go up. Perhaps a little on the lengthy side - but still a solid piece of biopic cinema well worth a watch.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","deloudelouvain","14 January 2016","That was a pleasant movie to watch. I didn't get bored for one second despise the length of the movie. It's interesting to watch the way things happened during the cold war. The American propaganda, the brainwashed American people, the evil communists, we're good and they are bad and so on... It could still apply now when I think about it. Americans are still brainwashed by the media on daily basis. It's so normal for them after all those years that they have absolutely no clue whatsoever that they are being controlled by their government. Same things happen here in Europe as well though, but on smaller basis. I wonder when people will stop thinking everything that appears on television must be true? Never I guess because humans are just sheep and easily distracted from real problems. But back to the movie. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance were to me the two best actors in Bridge of Spies. Great acting in a story that keeps you interested for more then two hours. If you like some drama with a touch of biography then you will like this movie.

Once again, Tom Hanks is so good as a lawyer who has to defend a Soviet spy during the Cold War. But probably the best performance was Mark Rylance, the man who played the Soviet spy, and he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination. The cinematography is so beautiful and Spielberg perfectly captures the world in 1957.Most of this movie is conversations between Hanks and others during negotiations or court room scenes. A lot of people can be turned off by this, claiming it's ""too boring."" But if you like drama with a lot of intrigue about history, you will be engrossed in Bridge of Spies. It is a slow and long movie, so you have to be patient while watching.

"Bridge of Spies","jimbo-53-186511","29 October 2016","James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is a lawyer who practices in 'insurance' law, but when he's tasked with defending Soviet spy and traitor Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) it proves to be a case that is not only career-defining for Donovan, but one that is also life-changing as well.Bridge Of Spies was a film that did hold my interest and have me gripped (up until the conclusion of Abel's trial). However, from this point on, at least as far as I was concerned, it gradually became less and less interesting....The first problem lies with how the film has been structured - Bridge Of Spies is a film that runs for over 2 hours, but in those 2 + hours the film essentially only has two threads hanging it together (Abel's trial and the exchange of prisoners). What you get here is about 45 minutes of trial and about 90 minutes of Donovan's various conversations with government officials. As I've said the first third of it is OK, but the final two thirds of the picture are repetitive and rather dull and it quickly becomes evident that the prisoner exchange aspect of the story does not necessitate 90 minutes worth of screen time.The next issue lies with how imbalanced the whole film feels; as I've said great portions of the film are spent on both Abel's trial and on Donovan's wonderful negotiating skills in effecting the prisoner exchanges, but Spielberg and his team of scriptwriters (2 of whom are the Coen brothers) seem to overlook other aspects of the film such as what happened to Abel whilst he was in the US? What happened to Powers when he was captured in Russia? What happened to the American student whilst he was held in Germany? Spielberg sets all these plot points up on an assembly line, but doesn't delve deeper into any of these plot points which at times means that the film lacks depth and insight. I was particularly disappointed that Powers didn't factor as prominently in the story considering that he was quite an important character.Rylance won an Oscar for his performance here which I personally found a bit puzzling (yes he's OK, but I didn't really see anything brilliant about his performance). Hanks again is OK but he generally gives a fairly stock 'everyman' performance which isn't that big a stretch for him.When all is said and done I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed by Bridge Of Spies; to me it put too much focus in some areas and not enough focus in other areas which resulted in an imbalanced and poorly structured film. I think the best way to summarise it would be 'interesting subject matter that was poorly delivered.'","5/10"

He does establish that the US should treat its prisoners well at least for the hope that our imprisoned soldiers or agents will receive reasonable behavior from jailers.In 1960, the Russians shoot down the U2 reconnaissance plane flown by Francis Gary Powers over the USSR, and imprison him afterward. Powers has a great deal of classified intelligence that might be divulged. The Russians want Abel back; the Americans want Powers back.Delineation of conflicts: James is 'requested' to negotiate the swap, but is not given diplomatic recognition, and must work as a private citizen. The East Germans detain Pryor, an economics PhD student as a spy to use as a chess piece.James has to deal with a lot of murkiness, since none of the transactions are done officially. He has to deal with the Russians to get Powers, and the East Germans to get Pryor. The Russians and East Germans have their own agendas.Resolution: There's a lot of juggling, but it turns out relatively well.","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","bix171","31 January 2016","Especially with his adult entries, Steven Spielberg has made a claim for being perhaps America's most elegant filmmaker, with shrewd choices in material coupled with effective storytelling skills highlighted by precise framing and expert use of tracking cameras (in collaboration with his superb cinematographer Janusz Kaminski). ""Bridge Of Spies"", while not quite reaching the Hitchcockian suspense and psychological depth of ""Munich"", nonetheless is a very fine example of Spielberg working with commitment and intensity to provide the mature film-goer a satisfying, thoughtful experience. Here, the Cold-War plot (based on true events) is fairly cut-and-dried: a Russian spy (Mark Rylance), unsuccessfully defended by attorney Tom Hanks, is used as a negotiating tool to retrieve downed spy pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) and, against the wishes of the CIA spook (Scott Shepherd) fronting the mission in Berlin, a student trapped on the other side of the Wall (Will Rogers). Working from a beautifully written script by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers (supressing their smarm for a change), Spielberg underplays the action, working off body and facial nuance and well-timed, eloquent dialogue. The performers act with grace, particularly Hanks, continuing his transformation into the elder statesman of Hollywood film, and Rylance, whose placidity in the face of abandonment and death is appealing and entertaining. The only thing marring the film is Thomas Newton's score: while understated, it appears at inappropriate moments, distracting from the action on screen. But this is a minor quibble. The overall result is plausible and accessible--a very admirable addition to the impressive yet under-appreciated Spielberg canon.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","maulin5","21 November 2015","A Steven Spielberg movie based on the era of the cold war. The film tells the story of lawyer James, who is entrusted with negotiating the release of Francis, a pilot whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union & in exchange for Rudolf Abel, a captive Soviet KGB spy held under the custody of the United States. Though the whole film is talkative. No fights, no actions, just chatting. So, many may not like this. I'm in that category. Background score is nowhere in the film, and may be it's a plus point. But, I don't like this kind of a silent movies. So, even after having a good story and a good casts, the film offers no entertainment to me. So I am telling you to skip this. Or watch it if you find the subject interesting!","5/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Wizard-8","16 June 2016","I'm not sure what caused me to pick up ""Bridge of Spies"" when I found a Blu-ray copy of it at my library, since its length and the fact that it had Tom Hanks (an actor who usually gives me annoyance) seemed to be obstacles. But I'm glad I did. While the movie is long (140 minutes), credit director Steven Spielberg for making the package chug along fairly briskly, while at the same time showing that the world of espionage in real life is often a lot of work and not flashy business. The acting is also pretty good; even I had to admit that Tom Hanks does a pretty good job here, giving his character a kind of everyman feel that gives him sympathy.The only real flaw that the movie has is that it doesn't go into depth enough with some key details - namely the backstory of both Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and American pilot Francis Gary Powers. Now, I actually knew a lot about their real life stories before watching the movie, so I was able to fill in the blanks. But I suspect most viewers will know little to nothing about both men before watching the movie, so they may be scratching their heads every so often. However, I will admit devoting more time to these real life individuals may have made the movie overlong. So you may want to research both individuals before watching this movie.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","PrashunChakraborty","19 October 2015","I don't think I can criticize this movie, it's a Spielberg film after all, nearly flawlessly made, Tom Hanks is excellent as usual (but let's face it Tom Hanks has never acted poorly in ANY film EVER), mostly historically accurate as well. In fact if it would have been made by anyone else I may have liked it a lot more than I currently do, but alas Steven Spielberg has become a victim to his own success and ability. So all I can say is that while this movie is solid it's nothing spectacular, there are no great scenes but the story is well done and it's evenly represented, a couple of weeks ago I watched Edward Zwick's Pawn Sacrifice and found it to be very pro American and anti Russian, Spileberg of course is above all this pettiness and delivers a balanced film in which both sides are fairly represented. However, I was expecting the raw power that Spielberg delivered in Munich (last time he tackled the theme of espionage) but that's not what this movie is about, it feels a lot simpler and the stakes never feel high. Bridge of spies is a good movie and can go on the B-Side of Steven Spielberg's greatest hits along with The Terminal, Lincoln, War Horse etc. while the A side continues to have Schindler's List, Saving private Ryan, Raiders of the lost ark etc.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Sylviastel","20 September 2018","Sir Mark Rylance earned an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Rudolf Abel, a German immigrant in the United States over espionage in the late fifties. America was going through the McCarthy era where the fear of communism was paranoia. As a daughter of parents who lived through Communism Eastern Europe in the fifties, they immigrated to the United States. The Germany especially the East Berlin side was grim and bleak under communism. This film did a terrific job in relating and bringing the story to life about James Donovan, a lawyer who defended Abel under enormous pressure. His family endured bullying and taunting from friends, neighbors and colleagues. Tom Hanks was perfect in the role by the way. Alan Alda also played a supporting role. Again the film really belonged to Sir Mark Rylance who was also awarded Knighthood for his services as an actor. I could watch him in anything.","4/10"
"Bridge of Spies","siderite","30 December 2015","Personally I thought the movie was a bit too heavy-handed and that the ending was way more melodramatic than it should have been. But the movie was good. More than that, it is a story that must be shown today. I felt the ending kind of ruined the effect a little bit, though.The story is that of a lawyer who believes in the law - imagine that - and because of his extraordinary efforts to defend a Russian spy in the heavily patriotic legal system from 1957 he is tagged to intermediate a prisoner exchange. You get this idea directly from the trailer and the plot, as it were, is not deviating from that. Instead, it is Hanks' acting and Spielberg's directing that you need to appreciate, as they masterfully make the case for the spirit of America, not for its power.The film is based on a real person, and his own autobiographical book, and it is well rendered, albeit a bit paint-by-numbers. The title of my review is more accurate than I would have wanted. Even so, I felt that the first part of the movie was great and that it should have been a film on its own. You get a man that is doing his job and upholding the moral values Americans are so proud of by defending a man that everyone thinks is despicably guilty and as reward gets scoffed at, gets the evil eye and even has shots fired at his house - 2nd amendment style - from a driving by car, only to be blamed for it by the police officers called to investigate. He returns to his job only to find that cases he was assigned to were reassigned and his partners are reluctant to speak to him.That message is far more relevant today than the general result driven heroics that movies - including this one - usually portray. The point is that good means different things for different people and therefore it never actually wins. The fact that Donovan had a successful career as a negotiator later on is good for Donovan, but I felt it hurt the movie.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Zoltanko","17 October 2015","It's easy to get caught up in the magnificent acting performances of this film's phenomenal international cast. Of course you expect Tom Hanks to put his usual Oscar-worthy skills on display, and he does in scene after scene. But everyone in the supporting cast is equally as memorable, not to mention Mark Rylance, who is one of the most talented actors many people may not recognize or even be familiar with. It's also easy to get caught up in the beautiful, period cinematography, locations and sets in Bridge of Spies. The look and feel of both early 1960's America plus the depressing starkness of East Berlin during the escalation of the Cold War are depicted perfectly.But what came through to me more than any of these individual pieces is the unsurpassed storytelling skills of Steven Spielberg. Not only does he get one of the best performances out of Hanks in his entire career, but his attention to detail and nuance is utterly amazing. When Hanks is confused, Spielberg makes sure you are as well. When he's feeling anxious or paranoid, the director makes you equally as apprehensive. But he does this with visual cues, glances, hints and a marvelous musical score.This is cinema at its purest and its best. Dialog is less important than the visuals, but the script is tight, crisp and taught. Nothing is wasted. In a season when there have been a great many outstanding films to hit the screen (Mr. Holmes, Black Mass, Everest) Bridge of Spies is a must-see for anyone who loves a well-told story that will make you wonder how two hours can fly by so quickly.","9/10"

The story is basically NOTHING else but one long continuous discussion about exchanging a Russian for an American during the start of the Cold War. Over 2 hours of talk, talk, talk between Russian / East German officials and Tom Hanks is rather tedious, to say the least...The good: it's well acted, for sure. Especially Tom Hanks performs well, but he cant ignite any spark, because this story is incredibly dull.The bad: the story is dull: There are NO surprising plot turns.

It felt as though nothing really happened after the first thirty minutes or so. Obviously this rendition of spies during the Cold War is more realistic than what you typically think a spy movie would be, but they definitely could have spiced it up a tad. I like the message that Hanks' character sends about the treatment of human beings, but I still have no idea how he really pulled off the 2 for 1 BOGO trade. Giving this movie a 6/10 because the concept is cool, but there were a lot of loose storylines and I got lost. Bonus point for young Noah Schnapp.","4/10"

"Bridge of Spies","cherold","31 January 2017","Bridge of Spies tells the story of lawyer James B Donovan's defense of a Russian spy and subsequent role as a negotiator in the trade of that spy for U.S. pilot Gary Powers.It didn't strike me as that intriguing a story, honestly, but I like director Stephen Spielberg so I thought I'd take a look.The result is surprisingly engaging. The story is simple but interesting, the movie deftly sketches out cold war tensions, and there are solid doses of humor and drama. While I often find Tom Hanks a little too noble, he nicely underplays Donovan, who comes across not, like a lot of Hanks' roles, as a man so noble that he is on the verge of tears at his own nobility, but rather a smart lawyer with a great deal of integrity. There are no speeches, no tearful moments, but you wind up really admiring the guy.Even better is Mark Rylance as the Russian spy, an odd, phlegmatic little guy with his own kind of integrity.While the movie is entertaining and absorbing, it is a movie that, like Spielberg's Lincoln, feels a little too careful and educational to really bring history to life the way a movie like Spotlight does. Spielberg seems to have lost interest in taking chances (I really think he should break out of his mold and make a Dogme 95-style film), and that can make his films seem a touch stodgy, but he still has that remarkable directorial expertise, and certainly knows how to make a movie.","6/10"

"Bridge of Spies","paul2001sw-1","12 September 2020","'Bridge of Spies' is a solid retelling of the Gary Powers incident, where a U.S. pilot was shot down over the Soviet Union while conducting reconnaisance at the height of the cold war. Powers was ultimately repatriated in a prisoner exchange, and the film is told from the perspective of the civilian lawyer who negotiated the deal. Tom Hanks plays the lead as an All-American, squared-jawed liberal lion, but the film is nicely nuanced, with just one moment of corn (where Hanks happens to see some wannabe escapees from East Berlin shot in the act). Spileberg directs and the Cohen brothers wrote the script, so the film's basic competenace is hardly surprising; but it's nicely nuanced story with a Le Carre-esque mood, with just one moment of corn (where Hanks happens to see some wannabe escapees from East Berlin shot in the act). Overall, it's an interesting portrait of a difficult time, and one with a rare happy ending where a negotiated solution stopped the cold war getting colder in a way that the world could little have afforded.","3/10"
"Bridge of Spies","caseynicholson","17 January 2016","If you're a fan of historical dramas--films based on true stories and the like--then you definitely should check out ""Bridge of Spies"". I found this movie to be absolutely great, and it's very easy to see how and why it's been nominated for Best Picture.Perhaps the strongest part of this film is its overall production. I didn't know a thing about the movie going into it (I watched it as part of my attempt at seeing all of the 2016 Best Picture nominees), and so I had no clue that it's a Steven Spielberg film. That said, when you see this movie you'll be reminded of what true craftsmanship looks like in a film production. The scenes, the camera work, pretty much everything in this film just comes together to make it an outstanding effort in filmmaking.I also can say that I enjoyed Tom Hanks in this performance. I do sometimes have trouble getting into Tom Hanks movies these days, as he's sort of become too big of a star--I always see him as himself rather than as whoever he's playing on screen. That was true for ""Bridge of Spies"" as well, but the role of a random New York attorney in the middle of the 20th Century makes that whole aspect less bothersome than if he were playing a more well known historical figure.All that said, I seriously considered giving this movie a perfect 10, and I can see how many people might do just that. I've held back from the perfect rating for one lone aspect, and that's that this movie probably doesn't have the ""epic"" feel to it that I tend to want to reserve a perfect score for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is a fantastic movie that will entertain you for a couple of hours--but fifteen years from now it's probably not going to be a movie that you remember too much about. The story provides great escapism for the moment, but it just isn't so mind blowing or suspenseful that it warrants being thought of in the same category as, for me, an ""Unforgiven"" or a ""Chinatown"". Thus my 9/10 star rating.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Real_Review","12 May 2019","Can Spielberg make a movie that's less than 2 hours anymore? Seriously... WAY TOO LONG!!! And, why, you might ask? Well, because of all of the bad puns and jokes that have no place in a movie like this. Also, because of all of the dead air and space that Spielberg left in the movie for 'effect' (like a clock ticking for 20 seconds to illustrate that Tom Hanks was bored... Thanks.) Oh, and it was also long from all of the interludes filled with terrible orchestral music. Music can make a film, and there were times where the music was as bad as the jokes. No one wants to tell the Legendary Spielberg and Iconic Hanks that less is more, so we are left with a movie that will be forgotten by the next decade.One bright spot - the scene where Gary Powers' plane gets shot down is brilliant (not a spoiler - it was in your history textbook in 9th grade).

"Bridge of Spies","eva3si0n","19 December 2020","Bridge of Spies is divided into 2 parts. The first time the action takes place in the United States, excellent judicial drama. With a slow development of events, which is noteworthy completely without musical accompaniment (a rarity in modern cinema). The second part, this is already an action movie in the style of M (James Bond), where the whole action is accelerated and at least repel the turnover of musical accompaniment. And the second part is terrible. In the first, the USSR and the GDR are shown as barbarians. Great propaganda. The most important thing is how Spielberg fakes the facts. Berlin was bombed not by the USSR, but by the Allies. The USSR, on the contrary, helped restore the ruins of eastern Berlin. And finally Abel in the USSR was recognized as a hero and confirmed the status of a spy. And to talk about the light in which the GDR is represented does not have to, some kind of ghetto.
And most importantly, 2 part of the film is a natural B-movie, which you watch by inertia and only for the sake of acting by Tom Hanks.","8/10"

"Bridge of Spies","rubenm","7 December 2015","Who would ever have thought that the Coen Brothers would co-write a film directed by Steven Spielberg? At first sight, it seems a very improbable combination. On the one hand the traditional Hollywood giant of blockbuster fame, and on the other hand the unruly creators of weird characters and unorthodox stories.This could have been a disaster: a terrible clash of two styles of film making. But in fact, it is a wonderful cooperation. The film is mostly made according to the standard Spielberg recipe of big drama, but seasoned with some very tasteful spices of Coen-like creativity and dry humour.I think I recognized some very clear Coen-moments in the film. At one point the hero of the story, American lawyer James Donovan, walks into the Russian embassy in Berlin hoping to meet an official called Mr Vogel, but instead is greeted by a bunch of rumpled peasants. This is, I think, typical for the Coen Brothers. One other very recognizable Coen-moment is Donovan's visit to the East German prosecutor, who picks up the wrong phone. This whole scene is filmed in the slightly surrealistic way that characterizes many Coen-films 'Bridge of Spies' is a cold war drama. It tells the true story of a righteous American lawyer who defends a Russian spy, learns to appreciate his professionalism and subsequently is asked to negotiate an exchange of prisoners in Berlin. The screenplay is very clever, with three spy stories woven into one narrative: the Russian spy in the US, an American pilot who is captured by the Russians after his plane is shot down, and an American student who happens to be in the wrong part of Berlin when the Wall is built.Sometimes Spielberg accentuates the dramatic effects a bit too much, for example when the student tries to leave the Eastern section of Berlin and sees how the last peace of concrete closes the Wall between him and the West. But on the whole this film is cinematographic craftsmanship at its very best. The screenplay keeps on introducing new, exciting story elements, the sober but effective acting by Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance is spot on, and the period sets recreate the Cold War era perfectly. It is hard not to like this film.","8/10"

"Bridge of Spies","kislaykaushal22","18 October 2015","Set in the Cold War era, in Brooklyn, Bridge of Spies is a story about a successful insurance prosecutor, James B Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is given a case to defend a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A true nationalist and yet an idealist lawyer, James draw a lot of flak from his men for his earnest and professional efforts in the case. But soon, his ideology leads him to a precarious task of rescuing an American pilot, a task gravely sensitive for the two conflicting nations. The movie is not a nail biting thriller which the title or the trailer or Saving Private Ryan might have suggested. This is a very evenly paced drama, predictable for most of the time but boasts of meticulous details, a hallmark of Mr Spielberg. The story is inherently a little weak, yet Mr Spielberg manages to spin off a decent movie out of it. James and Rudolf really hit it off and it is fun to watch them together. Tom Hanks is at his usual best and Mark Rylance befits the character of an extraordinarily wise, artistic and resolute Russian soldier. Other characters are not of much significance and a couple of them actually seem needless. The movie follows a depiction of the event as it happened and doesn't display any deliberate dramatization. Consequently, it doesn't evoke any strong emotions while watching which some people might actually prefer. Personally, I believe a better connect and impact would have made this movie far more memorable. This definitely is a decent, American film which scores completely on actors, cinematography (involving 1960 Brooklyn) and direction. But considering what Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks have done before, I had stomach for more.","6/10"

Given the accolades, I was hoping for something more suited for an adult audience. Rylance is a good actor, but that doesn't make it a good film, just watchable when he is in the scene. And those poor kids of Hank's - subject to such hatred because big daddy stood up for justice and the American flag. It isn't even interesting from the historic recreation of New York - just a demonstration of how much money can be spent on a movie that really doesn't tell much of a story. There could have been more depth, and less devotion to period drama. And the script was pretty dire at many points - dialogue when no words were needed at all.","1/10"

I don't think many actors could have given the role so much effect, especially such a quiet one, but he managed to do that and more. The problem is that he's stuck in a film that is completely and thoroughly just fine. The good thing is that, except for the sentimental ending, Steven Spielberg doesn't interfere too much with the story around him. He is mostly restrained. Overall, this isn't something I will be aching to rewatch any time soon, and not something I will remember.

"Bridge of Spies","DareDevilKid","12 February 2016","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.8/5 starsWith ""Bridge of Spies"", Steven Spielberg infuses new life in Hollywood's all-but-forgotten Cold War espionage thrillers from the 70s and 80s. He goes about creating an arresting, sometimes haunting milieu in the midst of a mission of wits and high-intensity at the height of the Cold War, where American attorney James B. Donovan is recruited by the CIA to negotiate the release of a US spy-plane pilot - shot down and captured in Soviet territory - in exchange of a KGB spy, Rudolf Abel, who was arrested for espionage in the US.Spielberg enters full-blown Stanley Kramer mode, and triumphantly delivers (like he has on numerous times in his distinguished career) a socially conscious tale of back-and-forth diplomacy and behind- closed-doors politics at home, at the office, and on the global stage. At the same time, he doesn't let up the tension for a moment in this richly-detailed narrative where the interactions between smart and unpredictable characters is the main focus of the Director and his writers (the maverick Coen Brothers; avant-garde filmmakers in their own right). And, eventually, it's these interactions that are the core foundation of ""Bridge of Spies"", with its real strength lying in the bond developed between its two main characters - unwitting negotiator Donovan (Tom Hanks in fine form) and incarcerated Soviet spy Abel (Mark Rylance deservedly an Oscar nominee). The warm portrait of a highly unlikely friendship is perhaps the movie's greatest achievement, even more than its sublime Direction, crisp writing, lasting cinematography, and exemplary performances.Steven Spielberg and the Coen Brothers take on the Cold War and spy world with a visually stunning, tension-filled, and surprisingly feel-good thriller that slithers along with gripping intensity and tantalizing uncertainty.","10/10"

"Bridge of Spies","kekca","6 January 2016","Okay. Because of the perspective of every idealistic person and mostly because this movie is based on real historical events it should be also presented here. Yes, the world has the need of such persons, regardless of age, gender, nationality. The final explanations in the film can best explain this.About that the highest human nature does not recognize propensities and is capable of creativity. Often transcend the established order and shines above it, although we know many cases where it remains neglected, gray and misunderstood.About the nonsense that we have caused to ourselves some time ago, and are still trying to inflict. About complete rethinking of our values. About the price and the meaning of human existence. About farsightedness and nearsightedness, which in both cases are defects, equally different world views.About the cult of personality, but also of the way that it is displayed. More decently for the one who receive himself as surpassing it will always be better if he is modest and non-woven. I.e. it may be added further quality and quantity to be removed.

"Bridge of Spies","tabuno","13 January 2019","24 October 2015. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance star in this amazing, intense, and compelling movie about the behind the scenes negotiations between James Donovan, a United States lawyer, and the U.S.S.R. and East Germany for the exchange of Rudolph Abel, a convicted Russian spy and Gary Powers, whose American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Russia in 1961. This mainstream movie directed by Steven Spielberg brings great cinematography, setting, and performances to build the tension, suspense through acting and script especially without action and fireworks. This is truly a big screen, big tent-pole event movie based on historic events as well as the poignant fear and importance of the human spirit in the face of a frightening, uncertain foreign world.There is a pungent feeling of both dread and hope in this dark mysterious world of espionage. Bridge of Spies carries its weight of deeper psychological warfare reminiscent of John LeCarre's classic Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy (1979) or Breach (1997) and with setting a similar tone and flavor of The American (2010) or Sum of All Fears (2002) as well as a same period spy movie The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965) or The Russia House (1990) presenting a smaller scale, or the more broader sweep found in The Good Shepard (2006), all possessing a powerful espionage theme. This movie is riveting, capturing the visceral emotive uncertainty and fear, sometimes powerlessness, and sometimes faithful confidence that arises from an understanding the serious game being played. In addition there are some nicely timed and edited subtle humor to balance the drama occurring on screen. Overall, this is one of the best movies of the year.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","eleagece","25 January 2016","When Spielberg is behind the cameras you know you're going to watch a movie which is at least correct. Luckily, Bridge of Spies is more than correct: it's a remarkable film from start to finish.Its strenghts are the great staging, the dark and cold photography and the rock-solid acting. There is nothing more to be said about Tom Hanks, he is able to make crappy films like Da Vinci Code entertaining, so in a good movie like this one, it's obvious he nails it. I've loved the other main character, Mark Rylance as the Russian spy. He transmits composure no matter what is going around him. The ties that bind his character to Hanks' one trascend the main plot and send a bright message: people have essentially the same values, and if we are confronted is just because of the part of the board we started from when we were born.Its weaknesses, well... no risks taken. The plot is predictable and based in values overused in cinema like friendship, loyalty and honesty. Even the cinematography: after so many movies Spielberg knows himself too well, and his way of managing the resources seems obvious. Don't get me wrong, that is great because with an interesting story we have an interesting movie, but far from that feeling of novelty that makes a film special. To be precise: there are shots which feel like copy-paste from other of his movies (those scenes with headlights in backlighting, those slow chases, those cars moving and braking to stop in front of the camera...) and the pace is sometimes quite slow (there are scenes in which Spielberg shows the exact same thing from different angles, adding really nothing to the movie but redundant information). But anyway, it's an enjoyable movie. In fact the best from Spielberg lately.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","adamjohns-42575","3 November 2020","I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did. Cold War, historical things don't usually float my boat that much, but the story itself was very interesting and played very well.Based on real events, essentially it is about James Donovan's (Hanks) refusal to endure injustice, as he fights for the rights of Rudolf Abel (Rylance), back in 1957.
Later we learn that Donovan is almost as much of a humanitarian as Schindler with the work he does in Cuba, but we don't see that in this film, it's just interesting to see that he wouldn't be swayed by anything. He firmly believes in the law and stands by it.Both of the lead actors give outstanding performances, as you would expect and deliver a tale that could have been quite dull or something we've seen before.
It's funny how we have seen so many films these days that we have come to expect horrible things or sudden changes of circumstance to hit right at crucial moments and then we realise that it is a bio-pic and things don't always happen like that in real life. It actually adds to the tension and makes stories new again, because it changes the current formula of movies. Sometimes even when you know how the history actually turned out, you can still find yourself expecting the hero to be shot, even though you know he grows up to become the president or something?Based on the IMDB Trivia section, very few bits were added to flesh out the story and none of them really make much difference to how it made me feel, so you are getting quite a genuine interpretation of the events as the occurred.This film actually taught me a few things I didn't know, showing up huge gaps in my historic and geographic knowledge, but if you're more clever than me (It's not hard (That's what she said)) you may not experience this. I had no idea the USSR had control over East Germany and that's what the wall was all about, but then I did fail my Mock history exam and never turned up for the real thing. I shouldn't have taken all those days off school.I can't really say what made this one so good, but it's probably a lot of things all coming together as one, the filming, lighting, direction, sets, costume, all working collectively alongside the superb acting perhaps?","6/10"
"Bridge of Spies","MattBrady099","15 November 2015","James Donovan: ""Aren't you worried?""Rudolf Abel: ""Would it help?""Bridge of Spies takes place during the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.So I finally just watch Bridge of Spies and it was pretty damn good. Steven Spielberg once again made a great movie, and just like I said about Ridley Scott about how great it is that we still can go to the cinema today and see a new movie directed by an icon.Steven Spielberg is the type of director you never know what you're going to get and I'm talking about the type of film making he uses. Spielberg will always make a well directed movie even when some of his movies are not great or something you'll never watch again, it will still be well directed. Steven Spielberg's directing in Bridge of Spies was absolutely superb, because every scene is so perfectly crafted and Spielberg knows when to cut to a emotional reaction with the characters. These a couple of scenes in this movie that I didn't notice was all in one long wide take with no breaks, and that's because I was so locked in on what was going on with the characters and the scene itself. Spielberg brilliance is still present today as he's masterful style of film making is still alive today. If you love that kind of film making that's so masterful, perfect and old school, then Bridge of Spies might be the movie for you. This is one of the best directed films I've seen this year.Tom Hanks is one of the most lovable and respected actors of are times, as in every role he dose, he never disappoints. This is he's fourth collaboration with Spielberg after: Catch Me If You Can, Saving Private Ryan and The Terminal, and in Bridge of Spies Hanks once again deliverers a magnificent and believable performance. This is an Oscar worthy performance as he made his character so relatable, funny and very likable. Without spoiling anything, there's a scene in this movie where Tom Hanks character (James Donovan) gets followed by this unknown figure and at one point Donovan goes to sit at this restaurant to confront this man and the scene itself is just amazing, because Donovan knocks this guy to the ground with no action, just dialogue. Tom Hanks was amazing in this movie.Another performance that blow me away was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. I have seen this actor before in the hit TV show ""Wolf Hall"", and he was great in that show, but he impressed the hell out of me in this movie, because Mark Rylance was absolutely fantastic. This guy deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and I hope he dose, because it would be a huge sub if he doesn't get nominated. Mark Rylance was fan-freaking-tastic in this movie.The cinematography was excellent, the score was great, the dialogue is outstanding and the story was really good.Now for the problems: These a couple of scenes around the second act that wasn't that interesting to me.If you don't like talky movies then you may not enjoy Bridge of Spies, because this whole movie is nothing but talking and I know some people may not find that enjoyable. I'm the kind of person who likes dialogue driven movies and that's why I enjoyed this movie, because of the movies excellent dialogue and I how locked in I was while watching it, but I know it's not going to be for everyone and if you think this movie is boring because it's a talky movie then that's fine.Overall Bridge of Spies isn't Spielberg's greatest movie compared to his other ones, but it is a well crafted movie with excellent performances, fantastic directing and great writing. Bridge of Spies is the best Cold War thriller I've ever seen.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","shahe-512-458330","1 April 2017","Not my type of movies, but I liked the cinematography, story and the directing. Of course, who am I not to like Spilberg's movies? Tom Hanks is a stand alone, Oscar worthy element in the film and has not been nominated even. What will make me wonder for a while is how on earth did Mark Rylance win an Oscar as an actor in supporting role for this particular movie, and Tom Hanks was not even nominated? Yet again, to date I don't understand how Emily Blunt was not nominated as a best actress for The Girl on the Train... I will never understand how the Globes and Oscars committee work to give the credits. Bridge of Spies was a bit slow at the beginning but it elevated to an action packed, emotional second half bringing it to a satisfactory truthful ending. I recommend it to all spy and war genre lovers","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","takiyapatton-53976","27 October 2022","I really didn't like this movie. It was boring it didn't have any action in the movie. The acting was alright and it had good actors in the movie. Tom Hanks was very funny throughout the movie. The beginning kind of confused me because it just started off with arresting a random man. There wasn't any fighting, shooting, killing or anything, it was just very dry. This movie is my least favorite of all the other ones we have watched. I was expecting more drama and more intense scenes than what they showed. I was very confused throughout the movie. It really isn't worth watching. I rated this movie a 1 out of 10.

"Bridge of Spies","mikipryor-1","9 October 2015","Predictable and somewhat plodding story-telling. Yes Spielberg/Hanks are fabulous, but nothing felt fresh or original, no surprises. Watching masters doing what they have done over and over, for many years is OK, but felt stale. It's a good story, well acted, directed and written, but lacked spark. The first 30 minutes or so seemed pointless. They make good use of period cars but that was about it. Anticipated Schindler's List, but got 1941, not great. There is a moral compass but the energy was flat. Something is missing, no excitement, no chemistry. The family scenes felt inauthentic, forced intimacies. Minimal exploration of interpersonal relationships, ineffective and emotionless. Overall, disappointing.","10/10"

"Bridge of Spies","r96sk","11 September 2020","Superb film!I love 'Bridge of Spies'. Every angle of it, at least from my point of view, is expertly crafted. The score by Thomas Newman is outstanding, the onscreen talent bring their a-game while the story is extremely riveting. It lasts for 141 minutes, it felt like 90 minutes tops; it absolutely flies through its run time, at no moment did I feel anything close to bored.Tom Hanks is brilliant in the lead role as Donovan, yet another great performance to add to his résumé. He rightly takes all the plaudits, but some must be left for Mark Rylance who is also brilliant as Abel. The support cast also more than pull their weight, too.Undeniably worth your time.

"Bridge of Spies","peefyn","6 November 2016","So little was needed to make this a fantastic movie. The story itself is great, the insurance lawyer ending up way over his head, but approaching it with perfect calm. The mysterious spy. THe tension of the cold war. And the people involved in making this movie are also fantastic. From the Coens, to Hanks, Spielberg and so on. The movie looks good, and the actors do a good job.It seems like they tried to make a movie that is a bit more nuanced than good versus evil, where the characters aren't just black or white, but complex moral beings. But it doesn't really succeed. I like the way they explore the act all of the nations has to put up, and how all of them blunders, but do try to avoid war. But at the same time, the movie does not take the time to show the East Germans and the Russians as more than narrow minded. It was a terrible situation, and it should not be excused, but even a big movie like this should try to do justice to the (very real) people who lived back then, on all sides of the conflict. Much like Donovan does, in the movie.The movie is somewhat split into two, and the first part is definitely the best.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","akcenat","28 January 2016","This film was one of the most anticipated movies of 2015. It's directed by Steven Spielberg, has Tom Hanks in the lead role and has a script written by Joel and Ethan Cohen, but...it's more conversational and seems to be more dialogue intensive rather than any movement or action. Also, the movie is too long for the story and unnecessary baggage of scenes are added. Absence of adequate background score makes many scenes sound boring. Generally, there's not as much tension as one might hope, especially once Hanks is in Berlin, when film becomes slow as we wait for the deal to be brokered.It is OK movie, but that's about it. The film runs for over two hours and is almost nothing but talk, which makes it a bit of dull historical movie. In some ways, it feels like a film for school children. The flick's headlining novelty is Mark Rylance, who plays Abel with mesmerizing performance. Compering to him, Austin Stowell as Powers comes off as the equivalent of actor negative space. Overall, it just didn't make a huge impression on me. Rating: 6-Favorite quote:

"Bridge of Spies","GusherPop","20 May 2021","It's in the middle of WII, and James B. Donovan is an american lawyer and United States Navy officer in the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the Office of Strategic Services. And he got the case that would change his life and history. Donovan is recruited to defend a russian solviet spy in court (Rudolf Abel). At the same time work with and help the CIA arrange and exchange for the american spy for the soviet spy. The director, Steven Spilberg did an astonishing responsibility making a film that will have an effect on the younger generation, and the older generation. Some rare facts about this film is all the actors were very comfortable with each other. Tom Hanks took the job without reading the script, Powers' son was very concerned about getting the accuracy of the movie right, and Francis Gary Powers wasn't instructed to commit suicide upon capture.The characters in the Bridge of Spies are so well casted, and written, James B. Donovan is such a big and important character because he inspires Rudolf Abel to keep fighting to get back home, and don't give up, and fights for his rights, and freedom's. The characters have a special way of taking and putting a mode into the film and making the words come to life. Everyone deserves a defense. Every person matters. ""Everyone deserves a defense. Every person matters. You're asking me to violate the constitution. I'm an insurance lawyer. I'm not sure I want to pick it up. Everyone will hate me, but I'll lose."" James Dovovan's character really doesn't define what he does, it defines what he does and says, and he doesn't care about the law or the constitution says, he wants to save and get the trade done, no matter what it takes, even if he has to break laws. Most of what Donovan says, and his passion for securing over 9,703 men by July 3, 1963. This really adds to the film because a man or woman that wants to make a change or save a life(s), describes recognition or a movie on them, and respect. Bridge of Spies really shows how much power James Donovan had, and he didn't abuse it, he used it to save over 9,000 women and children from Cuban detention. The film was beautiful casted, Tom Hanks (Sully) , Mark Rylance (The BFG), Joshua Harto (Magnum P. I), Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone), and Alan Alda (M*A*S*H). All the Actors portrayed all the characters so well, I believe that they went through what the characters did.There are so many symbols in this film, The most important one is the handshake at the end, which shows James Dovovan and Rudolf Abel's friendship becoming more than friends, there family now, and over the entire film they get to know each other, and begin to trust each other, and become best friends. The next symbol is the picture of Donovan that Rudolf drew by hand, and he was given the plane back from russia. This shows that Rudolf showed respect and a thank you to Donovan for saving his life, and returning him to his family. The last symbol is the Glienicke bridge, it explains the division between the American government and the Solivet Union, and they have different views, political ideals, and way they treat their citizens.Some eye opening shots in ""Bridge of Spies"" is one of the last scene where they're walking on the Glienicke bridge and it's all dark and all the light is on the ground and the bridge, and it is such a rare shot in any drama I've seen. Another great shot is when Donovan is going to Germany and the Nazis ask for his papers, and the shot is over 2 shoulders and just shows James Donovan's feelings and emotions and speaks a little german.The Theme of Bridge of spies is ""Everyone matters"", James Donovan gets involved because even Soviet spies deserve a fair trial. The main dilemma for him in the spy swap is his determination to rescue not just the high profile, spy plane pilot, but the unimportant student too, and the movie covers issues related to today. Bridge of spies teaches you, everyone matters, even the smallest kid to the smartest person alive they matter. When I watched this film when it came out on October 4,2015. As I watched it, it made me reflect on my life. Did I give everyone a chance, did I respect them, etc.. It made my think so deep, i watched it over and over and over till I got what the movie was trying to teach me which was don't believe what the news, people say about another person, get to know them and ask them there side of the story, and get to know them, and respect them, because you never know how you can change a life if you don't start caring and putting a little love back into the world.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","davidgee","9 December 2015","The role of James Donovan would have gone to Jimmy Stewart in years gone by and Hanks brings that same 'warhorse' integrity to the role: a man of modest intellect bringing more to his duties than was demanded or expected of him. Mark Rylance has a more challenging role, since Rudolph Abel is given very little back story, but as Donovan slowly warms to this cold enigmatic man, so do we, the audience. The trial scenes are inevitably slow and static, like their equivalents in LINCOLN and AMISTAD, but when events move to Germany this becomes as enthralling as anything else maestro Spielberg has brought us. Berlin in 1961 - a seamless mixture of set and CGI, presumably - is almost the real star of the movie, grim and oppressive: we see the Wall being built and some heart-wrenchingly desperate escapes. BRIDGE OF SPIES is history, with only a little jazzing-up (and some condensing of the time-line), so we know how it's going to end, but Spielberg and Hanks manage to generate terrific tension in the final scenes. This whole picture is a chilling reminder of the darkest period in East-West relations, hopefully never to be repeated.","10/10"

What seemed like an open and shut case of espionage Abel was given insurance lawyer James B. Donovan, Tom Hanks, to represent him to show the world as well as the hated Soviet Union that he was to get a fair trial before he's to be executed or at least sent away for life for his crimes. Donovan really takes his job as well as the US Constatution seriously and defends Abel to the best of his ability only to have his client convicted and given a 30 year sentence which to many Americans seems like a slap on the wrist: That's after the Rosenbergs were executed for the very same crimes that Abel was convicted of some five years earlier.With Abel locked away in federal prison in Georgia and Donoven appealing his conviction US Air Force pilot Francis Gary Powers,Austin Stowell, is shot down with his U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union on of all days May 1-May or Workers Day in the USSR-1960 giving Abel a lifeline for an early out by the US Government who's ready to exchange him for Powers. It was Powers who against orders didn't end up killing himself with a cyanide tipped needle before he was captured by the Russians alive that exposed him as a US spy not a weather man as the US Government claimed he was.With Donovan still Abel's lawyer he's told by his government to negotiate Abel's release in exchange for Powers who's been given a three year sentence, a lot less the Abel was given by the US courts ,behind bars as well as seven years house arrest-In the Moscow Hilton- by the Soviet peoples court. It's with all this going on a love sick American collage student Fred Pryor played by Will Rogers?, not the one you think it is but someone else, is busted by the Communist East German police in trying to get his German girlfriend out of the city of divided Berlin before it's walled up by the East German police as well as military. With the US more then willing to let the totally innocent Pryor hang-by his you know what's- but only wanting to get Powers, who in fact was spying on the USSR, freed Donovan makes it a point to get both Pryor as well as Donovan freed or else he just won't cooperate with his string pullers in both the State Department and Pentagon.***MILD SPOILERS SINCE HISTORY ALREADY SHOWED US WHAT HAPPENED***Donovan prevailed in the end getting both Powers as well as Pryor freed for the return of Rudolf Able in a nail biting exchange on the Berlin Gilenicke Bridge with out as much as a shot, in anger or celebration, being fired. Donvovan who was hated and called a dirty Commie by almost everyone who knew him is now a hero not only by getting Powers and Pryor back but later getting over 9,000 Cuban freedom fighters and their families back to freedom after being captured and arrested by Castro's troops in the disastrous ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion of Communist Cuba in 1961. As for Francis Gary Powers the main man in this movie he never was given the respect that he deserved in him not killing himself before the Commies or Russans captured him thus exposing the entire U-2 spy operations to the world at large. And putting the US, who up until then said it was national policy not to spy on anyone, the self proclaimed ""Good Guys of the Free World"" in a bad light.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","RossRivero99","27 October 2015","Steven Spielberg's latest film ""Bridge of Spies"" is another great historical masterpiece in his entire film-making career but with this one being much different than the rest, with Schindler's List talking about a very successful businessman at the time who also happened to be a member of the Nazi party who ended up saving 1200 Jews from concentration camps, Saving Private Ryan talking about the D-Day invasion and the casualties on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, Catch Me If You Can talking about the early criminal life of Frank Abagnale Jr., Munich talking about the five men assigned by the Israeli government to eliminate the terrorists responsible for the Black September bombings at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, as well as Lincoln talking about the last few months of Abraham Lincoln's presidency, and now with ""Bridge of Spies"" not only does Spielberg tackle the Cold War but also takes on the subject of communism along with it. The movie stars Tom Hanks (in an Oscar worthy performance) as a Brooklyn insurance lawyer named James Donovan who is told by his boss Thomas Watters (played by Alan Alda) that he was the unanimous choice to defend a Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) whom the majority of Americans want to be hanged but I'm not going to give anything away. After the trial is over the mission of the U-2 spy plane is in effect which it's job is to take pictures of what is going on in the Soviet Union from an altitude of 70,000 feet in the air and the person on that mission is an Air Force Lieutenant named Francis Gary Powers (played by Austin Stowell).After Powers gets arrested and jailed by the Soviets Donovan flies to Berlin to negotiate an exchange between Abel and Powers, soon after a college student majoring in economics gets arrested and immediately ends up being a part of the exchange. Spielberg directed this movie with suspense,passion, and a huge love of country, and not to mention those scenes with Donovan and his wife Mary (played by Amy Ryan) are just heartbreaking. This movie is undoubtedly in my mind the best movie of the year.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","iquine","14 September 2017","(Flash Review)This movie's story is very linear and straightforward. The story objectives are clear as lawyer Hanks is tasked with negotiating an international exchange of a downed American pilot for a Russian spy while in Germany in the 1950's. Hanks must manage a few negotiation twists and read between the lines to keep and get leverage. The movie highlight must go to the sets and production crew. It looked and felt greatmuch like Munich. Hanks was quality as usual and the editing kept the pacing moving along at a nice clip. The best character was the Russian spy; tremendous performance. The movie could have somehow added more tension or emotion or to help me care for the character's outcomes. Overall, a very solid movie without causing much cognitive effort.","9/10"

America had in their possession a man they believed to be a Russian spy and James B Donovan, an unassuming insurance lawyer was coerced into negotiating the exchange of the two men. This film was pure Spielberg. Extremely well shot using interesting angles to provide menace and intimidation, combined with writing provided by Matt Charman and the amazing Joel and Ethan Cohen, this film had me glued to my seat. It wasn't all action, it was gritty, moving, and in places even amusing. It was also very sobering as we were treated to scenes of the wall being built between East and West Germany and the desperation of people trying to cross before it was completed. The plane spotter part of me was happy to see the U2 being depicted (whether it was real or a model I don't know but it looked pretty good). I could easily watch this again. Superb performance from Tom Hanks and I really liked Mark Rylance, who played the 'Russian Spy' Rudolf Abel, spy or not his performance evoked empathy for the character. It was good to move away from superheroes and disasters for a while and get my teeth into a gritty drama.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","feakes","25 August 2016","Bridge of spies is based on a true historical event. When Rudolph Abel is caught sending secrets to the Soviet Union and is found out to be a spy Abel needed a lawyer and when no one came forward to do it. One lawyer named James Donovan was appointed. Donovan formerly a criminal lawyer and had served at the Nazi war trials had settled down and became a Insurance lawyer. Donovan doesn't want it. But it becomes clear to him that the case has already been tried and Abel found guilty in a court of public opinion. Donovan decides to do his best to win by any means Legal. This makes him a target in many quarters and unpopular. In an age where anti communist feelings ran high. The case was done in a highly illegal manner and Abel found guilty. Donovan however found a way to save Abel's life by suggesting that he may be useful in the future if say a American Spy had been caught. In this Donovan was smart and foretelling the future because that is what happened. Francis Gary Powers and A young medical student are captured as spies Powers for his failed U2 flight in which he got caught shot down and Pryor for being on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. the U.S. Government wanting to secure the release of both men but not seem involved ask Donovan to work for them but Publicly Donovan works for himself his mission get Powers home. Donovan finds out about Pryor and is determined that Both men come home. Donovan is on his own. no gadgets no tools no back up a lot of handlers watching him and giving him orders which he ignores some he takes seriously but over all he refuses to give up on Powers of Pryor. both men he insists are innocent and are coming home. Alone in a strange country not speaking the language and scared Donovan does the impossible. And that is the movie in every bit of glory. This humble man that would never think of himself as a hero is one. And this man who does the impossible wants one thing to go home and get rid of his cold.This just may be the best spy movie to come out of the last 35 years . and it also is tom Hanks best. Mark Rylance shines as Abel the unworried spy who becomes a pillar of strength to Donovan in the darkest points of the trial.

This was my benchmark when I decided to spend almost 2.5 hours in front of screen; I had some vacillations as the Americans tend to approach European events and characters in a different manner we are used to. Luckily, it was not the case here - European venues seemed authentic, German characters spoke/were German, there was no black-and-white approach regarding ""us vs. them"", etc. And as the plot is based on true characters and events, then realism prevails, and artistic exaggerations just ensure more spirited and dynamic course of events, diminishing aridity usually so characteristic to Cold War spy movies. Thus, the main ideas of justice vs. fairness and legality vs. humanity were skilfully moved to the surface. As for performances, they are good as well, particularly Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan and Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel; unlike many other movies with Hanks' starring, he does not dominate here, he is not evidently ""better"" (= so more famous) than his co-stars. And just today, Mark Rylance obtained his first Academy Award. Congratulations!PS Only last fall, my country experienced a similar event: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Dressen","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","troyputland","14 December 2015","Steven Spielberg. Tom Hanks. Mark Rylance. Joel Coen. Ethan Coen. Five reasons to love this film. Spielberg's directing is top notch, Hanks and Rylance's acting's cutting edge and the Coen's writing adds comedy to a serious film. There are two parts to Bridge of Spies. First part sees Hanks' lawyer defending Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) during the Cold War. In the second part Hanks' James B. Donovan negotiates a prisoner exchange; Abel for a captured American pilot. The coming together of the cast and crew make Bridge of Spies a riveting watch. Tensions are constantly high, even though there's minimal action. The few jokes spread throughout make it no less thrilling. Mark Rylance and Hanks are superb. It's hard to say whether one outdoes the other when they share the screen time.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","zutterjp48","3 July 2019","In 1957 James B. Donovan ,an insurance lawyer, becomes the defense counsel of Rudolf Abel.Donovan is a very intelligent man: he is convinced that Rudolf Abel alive might be more useful for a future prisoner exchange that condemned to death.So he manages to to spare Rudolf Abel the death penalty.The climate was very tense in the United States and Donovan was attacked in the newspaper for saving the life of Abel.Some days later, Gary Powers, an U-2 pilot is captured in the Soviet Union.The CIA convinced Donovan to organize a exchange of spies and sent secretly Donovan to Berlin (for his family he was working in London).Donovan hears about a U.S. student Frederic Pryor who has been arrested in East-Berlin and against the opinions of the CIA and U.S. government he is insisting in exchange Abel againt Powers and Pryor.
Donovan was an ecellent negociator, he had this intelligence and tenacity for convincing Russian and East-German for the exchange.

"Bridge of Spies","Danusha_Goska","18 October 2015","""Bridge of Spies"" is a big-budget, beautifully produced movie that is unabashedly geared toward thinking adults. There are no nods to fanboys who need to see ""part four"" after a title or a comic book superhero in tights to commit to a film. If you go to movies for fast- paced fight scenes, explosions or strippers, stay home. ""Bridge of Spies"" is an historical drama about the Cold War. It's based on real events. Insurance lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is pressured by colleagues to defend Russian spy Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), who has been caught in 1957 Brooklyn. It's his patriotic duty, they tell him, to provide the accused with counsel, even though the accused is a Russian spy at the height of the Cold War. Donovan does such a good job defending an unappealing client that he is later selected to help negotiate the release of downed U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. No, this isn't the most scintillating of plots. Most scenes consist of men over fifty wearing suits conversing in cagey language and subdued voices about big, big issues. Lavish spending by gifted costumers, set directors and cinematographers is all over the screen. The interior of a middle- class American home in the 1950s-1960s era is beautifully recreated, right down to the divided aluminum foil trays for TV dinners. It would be hard for a male to watch this film and not feel serious fedora envy. Women may yearn for the day when a woman could single-handedly prepare a five course meal for an intact family that eats together in a formal dining room, and yet appear at that dining table looking like a Vogue cover model with cinched waist, pointy assets, firm hair and bright lipstick. And then mom, dad, and the kids hold hands and say grace, and no one looks at their cell phone, or even the TV. They all pay attention to each other. As soon as the camera moves from the United States to East Berlin, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski drains almost all color from his images, the way Dracula drained blood from his victims. The sky is dead white, without clouds or sun, and almost everything you see is the lifeless gray concrete of the Berlin Wall or the charred gray of remaining bombed out buildings. People dress in gray wool; their grim faces are the only vague smudge of color. East Berliners attempting to escape are shot by snipers in watchtowers. It's a totalitarian nightmare. When Donovan enters East Berlin to negotiate Powers' release, he enters an absurd maze of petty manipulations and espionage that would be laughable were it not so deadly. These scenes are reminiscent of the depiction of the state apparatus of petty terror in real Eastern European films like Andrzej Wajda's ""Man of Marble."" Russian actor Mikhail Gorevoy as Ivan Schischkin, a Russian negotiator, is simply a weird and scary looking and sounding man. He wonderfully channels Peter Lorre. We all know, love and trust Hanks so much that there is not as much tension in the film as there ought to be. We know he's going to do the right thing, in spite of every obstacle, temptation, threat or sneer from a stranger on a train who recognizes him from a newspaper photograph. Somehow ""A Man for All Seasons,"" as many times as I've seen it, gives me the sense that maybe, just maybe, this time Paul Scofield's Thomas More will figure out a way to compromise with Henry VIII's demands and not be decapitated. That tension that maybe Donovan will weaken or sell out or be even slightly less than utterly heroic is missing from ""Bridge of Spies."" Spielberg wanted an uncomplicated hero, and he has created one. Mark Rylance gives an amazing performance as Russian spy Rudolph Abel. Rylance is apparently a highly celebrated British stage actor but I'd never heard of him. Rylance does virtually nothing noticeable except tuck his chin into his neck and elevate his eyebrows, yet he is riveting, moving, and memorable. Now that's acting! Abel was just one of the spy's many aliases. His real name was Vilyam ""Willie"" Genrikhovich Fisher. He was of German-Jewish ancestry. Did that play any role in his dedication to Communism? He had lived during the Holocaust. Did Communism offer the only brighter tomorrow in which he could believe? It would have made his life so much better if he had defected to the West, rather than go to prison. Why did he not? The film offers no clue. ""Bridge of Spies"" recreates for the viewer the undercurrent of daily fear during the Cold War. Schoolchildren cry during a school ""duck and cover"" presentation. A boy fills his bathtub with water so as to be prepared for nuclear attack. What was missing for me was what each side offered: an articulation of capitalism v communism. Perhaps the film could have included scenes where Donovan and Abel present their respective systems, their promises and flaws. There are reasons the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, and came down in 1989, reasons that seem to elude the supporters of US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. As it is, there is a marvelous scene where Donovan tells Hoffman, a CIA agent who looks a bit like Bobby Fischer (another pawn in the Cold War) what makes an American an American – the Constitution.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","RileyOnFilm","26 December 2016","""Bridge of Spies"" is a film directed by Steven Spielberg. For some these days, that may not be persuasive enough to buy a ticket so let me say it is crafted to make a historical event come alive on screen. It stars Tom Hanks but doesn't rely on his huge appeal. Hanks lets the story play out on its own without grandstanding with his character. There's an excellent cast with him and they all work together to make this film amazing.There is so much to enjoy here. It's first of all interesting because it is a true story. Second, it heralds the accused's right to a solid defense. There is much here about negotiations in and out of country. It's also a period piece replete with authentic props and there is a remarkable conclusion one may or may not expect.""Bridge of Spies"" is top notch storytelling about an event that should be remembered from the cold war. A couple questions are addressed:How can people thought of as evil make grand gestures of humanity? Why should we put effort into defending the rights of those such as a foreign spy?There are parts of those questions that require a long telling so the length of the movie may put off some. I was bored at times but I kept regaining interest. If one can keep ones attention span alive between the slower scenes, ""Bridge of Spies"" has many engaging moments and a most intriguing payoff. This is yet another in the sequence of movies I've been reviewing lately that definitely could win movie of the year. It is a story told by Spielberg worth watching.","7/10"

"Bridge of Spies","PipAndSqueak","5 December 2015","This is a very creditable attempt at telling the real story of 'Rudolf Abel' and the Cold War shenanigans that happened after the Second World War. Rylance manages to give a slight Scot's accent to Abel who was in fact born near Newcastle Upon Tyne (i.e. he would have spoken with a Geordie dialect). Never mind, Rylance conveys with perfect restraint the imperturbable front any spy worth his salt ought to aspire. This compares starkly with the slightly inept attempt at 'keeping secrets' shown by his American swappee, Powers, when subjected to interrogation. Spielberg manages to apply rose tinted spectacles at strategic points but thankfully, not too detrimentally. Compelling to watch for both Hanks' and Rylance's performances, you may be tempted to find out more about the characters they portray. Nice intro to the history!","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","meeza","15 January 2016","Master auteur Steven Spielberg's latest movie ""Bridge of Spies"" is not falling down, not falling down, not falling down. OK, I think my Bridge of Puns is nearly extinguishing you from further reading. But please continue to read for puns' sake. This 1950's true story film adaptation stars the splendiferous Tom Hanks as insurance lawyer James Donovan who inexplicably is delegated to defend arraigned Russian spy Rudolf Abel, exceptionally & subtlety played by Mark Rylance. Donovan is conflicted on defending a Russian spy and all the negative publicity it will receive; and not to mention how it will affect his family. Spielberg once again puts on the genius directorial cap with his intelligent direction of a Steven flick; and there are no bridge of lies with that statement. Another truth you have to handle is that Tom Hanks keeps on putting up strong work; he captivates with his starring performance as Donovan. But it is Rylance here who is the master thespian of the movie, and you can rely on that. Would you want me to add more on the movie? Would it help? But a few tidbits I will add: loved Thomas Newman's score of the picture and the solid screenplay from Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman. That's all I have to say about this movie. In other words, I would rather not be a spoiler spy and let you cross the rest of the ""Bridge of Spies"". ***** Excellent","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","burlesonjesse5","22 October 2015","Spielberg and Hanks. Hanks and Spielberg. Their collaborations have become legend. You've got 1998's Saving Private Ryan which I never went gaga over. Then there's The Terminal, not an awful film just meh. Finally, we have Catch Me If You Can, the duo's entertaining masterpiece (this is just my opinion). Bridge of Spies (my latest review) is the current synergy between these two celebrated, Hollywood giants. It's cinematic hot chocolate recommendable because of historical significance. ""Bridge"" with its darkly-lit scenes and bloated two hour- plus running time, falls into Steven's two categories of movies being hyperactive, action adventures and historical sagas. It hightails into the latter meaning it's talky, draggy, and mostly devoid of anything compelling. I felt as if I was watching Lincoln again minus the circa range of 1865. Translation: No second viewing for this camper.Taking place during the Cold War via 1957, featuring a cast of virtual unknowns (a Spielberg emblem), and written by none other than the Cohen brothers (Ethan and Joel Cohen of course), Bridge of Spies chronicles real-life insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Hanks). He's a family man, a dude bent on doing the right thing. When he gets saddled with defending a Russian spy (Rudolf Abel played uniquely by Mark Rylance), Donovan helps said spy avoid the death penalty while attempting to trade him for two American refugees (a fighter pilot and a graduate student who are both detained by way of espionage). The flick then involves globetrotting within the territories of Germany, Russia, and you guessed it, Brooklyn, New York. Scenes build to a slow creep combining negotiation dialogue that spews mannerisms at verbatim (Tom's James B. has the flu, we get it). I sensed that I'd been in the theater for ten hours and sat through three drawn-out endings (the final sequence is reminiscent of 1985's White Nights. It looks like a soundstage which is uncharacteristic of the mighty Steven Spielberg).In retrospect, the acting (as expected) is solid with Tom Hanks being well, Tom Hanks. We all know he's the quintessential everyman. Will he get a nomination from the Academy? Maybe but this is October so there's sixty days left in the fiscal year. Bottom line: The World's most socko director provides us with admirable storytelling, technical skill, and period detail of the highest order. Does he entertain the moviegoer in the process? Not entirely. Be sure to bring heightened intelligence and an attention span (the size of Texas) to actually feel immersed. This is a ""bridge"" too far if you ask me. Rating: 3 stars.","8/10"

"Bridge of Spies","justinwfirestone","1 February 2016","Why would Stephen Spielberg want to make Bridge of Spies, a Cold War spy thriller, when there's already plenty of better movies out there, like The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, the original Manchurian Candidate, The Lives of Others, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, or even The Third Man? The answer seems that Spielberg is using Bridge of Spies to draw thinly-veiled allusions to the modern War on Terror and enemy combatants, with warnings about xenophobia, government propaganda, and global hyper-nationalism.Bridge of Spies is engrossing and Mark Rylance is especially good as a dispassionate pawn, seemingly apathetic to every part of life and every person, except he has a deep respect for people who get knocked down and stand up again. However, the movie is simply good, not the great movie it wants to be. It lacks the necessary noir and suspense, two aspects hard to achieve in color.We get a legal procedural followed by some low-intensity negotiation and some minor history lessons. Our hero, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), also plays a manipulated pawn, but he has a few tricks up his sleeve because he's compassionate and thoughtful and impervious to propaganda. Information is key, and thus also secrets, so we must keep secrets about lies and lies about secrets (insert modern discussion of cryptography here). Eventually, no one knows who is zooming whom.We have the Rule of Law, which so often breaks down to the Rule of Man, because people write laws and choose whether and how to enforce them. America wants to show off it is better than evil police states, but the lesson here is maybe that's all we do. We simply show off we are better without the actual moral higher ground.Maybe Mario Puzo wrote it best in The Godfather: ""The lawyer with the briefcase can steal more money than the man with the gun.""","10/10"

"Bridge of Spies","abouhelier-r","5 December 2015","Bridge of Spies premiered at the latest New-York Film Festival, is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks. I loved this film but I have to admit that going to the movie I did not really know what to expect. You never know with Steven Spielberg; though it's more than likely it will always be a well directed film. However as far as Spielberg is concerned there's two types of well directed historical movie: Saving Private Ryan and Lincoln (that last one is perfectly crafted but if you've seen it once, you'll probably never watch it again). Here, the entire cast is engaging down the line. Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actor. He's genuinely one of the most likable actor in cinema history. This film is his fourth collaboration with Spielberg and once again he nails it.His performance is ultimately Oscar worthy with dry humour and reserve of intelligence that makes his character a man with very particular American ""greatest generation"" characteristics such as modesty, fundamental adherence to core principles he's been raised to value and live by. Hanks plays the movie's voice of conscience, he also can go dark but wasn't built to remain there for too long. Plus, Mark Rylance portrays a Soviet spy: Rudolf Abel with all his contemporary stages actor skills. He's very good bringing fascination and very, very subtle comic touches to a man who has made every effort to appear as bland, even invisible, as possible. Rylance really does a fantastic job, best supporting actor nomination at least.Like I said earlier, most Steven Spielberg's films are consummate entertainments that swipe you up with pure cinema. Bridge of Spies wonderfully comprehensive detailing of 1950's American life in the opening stretches, slides the viewers into the period. This is genuinely one of the best, if not the best, directed movie of the year so far. It's easy to say that because of Spielberg but I can easily see myself rewatching that film. Obviously Tom Hanks' character isn't sent to the Soviet to kill spies, but to negotiate a deal: so there's a lot of talking involved. You may be bored. But if like me you get butterflies in your body when you watch a perfectly crafted scene. When you notice that you've just seen a long wild single take of two people talking with no break, all because of Steven Spielberg brilliance: simulating a close up and mid shot. If this is your jam, you are going to enjoy this film as much as I did. Moreover, you get invested in this non-physical war. A war through words. Spielberg directed it as it was an action movie. He heats up the drama with some action, throws in crowds, chaos and transforms ordinary spaces like a home, an office or a street into battlefields. This film elevates to a new level of intrigue, tension and complexity in its last act and shapes up expertly into a John Le Carré style. Finally, this film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does nowadays. Overall, Bridge of Spies is one of the best Cold-War thriller I've ever seen, a true life espionage tale smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. Masterful old Hollywood style filmmaking.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","MrFilmAndTelevisionShow","19 July 2021","Another fine addition to both the Hanks and Spielberg collections.

"Bridge of Spies","TheExpatriate700","17 October 2015","I did not come to Bridge of Spies with particularly high expectations. Based on the commercials, it looked like an attempt to put a patriotic spin on what was an extremely embarrassing international incident for the United States. However, even though Steven Spielberg brings his usual optimistic outlook to the proceedings, he still crafts a well done film, boosted by an excellent cast and a script by the Coen brothers.Bridge of Spies focuses on the early 1960s prisoner exchange of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel for captured American pilot Francis Gary Powers and graduate student Frederick Pryor. Tom Hanks gives a strong performance as James Donovan, the American lawyer pressured into representing Abel and ultimately negotiating the exchange deal with the Soviets. He is backed by a strong supporting cast, especially Mark Rylance as Abel. Rylance deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the very least.The proceedings are prevented from descending into historical pageantry through a strong, witty script by the Coen Brothers. The serious national security proceedings are permeated with humor, particularly from the deadpan Abel. The script also manages to maintain a certain level of suspense, not a small feat given that we know how the events turned out. At the same time, the film offers important messages about the true nature of patriotism, lessons that are all too needed nowadays since patriotism has been reduced to militaristic fervor.The film does have some notable flaws. At times the pacing is rather slow, and the proceedings may lose the interest those with weaker attention spans. Furthermore, it downplays just how embarrassing the U-2 shoot down was for the United States, particularly after President Eisenhower was caught lying about the U-2 program at a US-Soviet summit. Nevertheless, the film is well worth your time.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","steiner-sam","14 June 2021","The film is ""inspired by"" events between 1957 and 1962 that culminated in exchanging a Russian spy for an American spy in 1962.In 1957 Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested in New York City by the FBI for spying. This is the middle of the Cold War, and it's only four years after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for giving secrets about nuclear weapons to the Russians. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is an insurance lawyer asked by the American Bar Association to defend Abel. Donovan is noted to have had experience as a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials.Donovan takes the case, defends Abel very well with strict adherence to the rule of law, and resists pleas by the CIA to reveal what Abel has said to him in privileged conversations. He appeals Abel's conviction to the Supreme Court but loses. He does convince the judge to sentence Abel to prison and not execution.Meanwhile, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Sowell) is a fighter pilot who is one of the ""drivers"" for the CIA's U-2 spy plane program. These planes flew at 70,000 feet and were thought to be unreachable by fighter planes and SAM missiles of the day. However, in 1960 he is shot down, captured by the Russians, and convicted of spying.This led to the thought of an exchange. Donovan is asked to do the negotiation in East Germany, not then recognized by the U. S. Donovan had no official status and thus was free to make an effort, but also offered deniability to the U. S. if things didn't work out.So the 140-minute film follows the storyline to the end. There is also an American graduate student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), who gets arrested in East Berlin about the same time. Donovan insists that Pryor be included in the exchange, though the CIA only wants Powers. Donovan's negotiations in East Germany take place while the Berlin wall is being erected. There are many opportunities for the dramatization of events, and Spielberg takes full advantage.Shots are fired at Donovan's home at one point, and he is mugged for his overcoat by some young toughs in East Berlin. Donovan forms a warm relationship with Abel, whom he regards as only doing his country's duty.This is a film dominated by Tom Hanks, and to a lesser extent, by Mark Rylance. Tom Hanks plays the ""everyman"" Tom Hanks; I have no idea if there is any relationship to the real James Donovan. Mark Rylance is a very appealing Rudolf Abel--a quiet little man who likes to paint and serve as part of the conduit of information to Russia, where his family lives.When I see ""inspired by"" (not even the more promising ""based on"" real events), I know the story is mostly fiction. James B. Donovan was a prosecutor at Nuremberg, but he also worked for the OSS for years. He was no simple insurance lawyer. All the violence in the film that Donovan observed actually never happened. Rudolf Abel's major spy work was during and immediately after World War II. He was pretty much a minor cog in the system at the time of his arrest. The U-2 planes had been flying since at least 1958.Most of the events portrayed around Frederic Pryor didn't happen. And on it goes.If you like Tom Hanks, you'll like the film. Mark Rylance does a remarkable job of playing a spy with a fatalistic worldview; I thought he alone was worth watching the film. The FBI and CIA guys are mostly ciphers. The Cold War clichés are milked a bit (""duck and cover""), and reference is made to Donovan's later work negotiating the release of prisoners held by Fidel Castro after the Bay of Pigs disaster. For some reason, the film has received a fair bit of critical acclaim.","10/10"

"Bridge of Spies","cdjhood-65924","7 January 2016","Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time with his massive and mostly amazing filmography this was one of my most anticipated movies of 2015 and it lived up to most expectations. Tom hanks is fantastic in this movie he is instantly likable as he is set up from the first scene as an honourable and hard working man. But my god Mark Rylance was outstanding in this movie, he stole every scene he was in and his ""Standing Man"" speech is one of the best monologues of the year. The era of the Cold War was very well done as it was clear how many people hated the soviets in this movie and also made for a lot of very intense moments and gave the impression that things could fall apart at any moment. Like most of Spielberg films Bridge of Spies is superbly directed with most of the scenes are long cuts, tracking shots and close ups. It could have been very easy in a dialogue driven film like to cut a lot but Spielberg doesn't fall for it. This film is not without its flaws, for one Powers' are in this movie was slow and honestly unnecessary as looking back at Savung Private Ryan the person they were trying to save in that movie didn't even make an appearance until 2/3 of the way through and that type of decision would also have worked very well for this movie. The film also suffers from a slow paced second half. With certain obstacles becoming a bit silly and drawn out and being a bit repetitive after a while.

"Bridge of Spies","tonypeacock-1","11 May 2023","I missed this on its release in 2015 so I had pleasure in catching a viewing on the day it was announced in the Best Picture category for the 2016 Oscars.Steven Spielberg directs Tom Hanks as a lawyer (James Donovan) more used to mundane insurance claims than international espionage brinkmanship. However in the late fifties at the height of Cold War tensions between the USA and the USSR he does just that when he is asked to defend an arrested Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance).Donovan is unsuccessful and becomes as hated as Abel in the process! However when US U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers is captured by the Soviets, Donovan leads the negotiations in East Berlin to exchange the pair. Also involved is a young US student who has been unluckily captured by the East German Republic during the Berlin wall construction. I usually dislike Hanks but his performance in this is great. Spielberg has directed historical stories like this before and continues his good track record here.The film moves along at pace. It never drags and keeps you enthralled with the story and East Berlin tensions. The motor vehicles used to recreate the late fifties/early sixties era are great.","7/10"
"Bridge of Spies","valleyjohn","26 December 2015","Bridge of Spies has the feel an old fashioned drama and has all the hallmarks of a Steven Spielberg film. The attention to detail , the charismatic leading man ( Hanks ) and the sentimentality . There's nothing not to like about this film but is that enough to make it great ? Probably not. Although Tom Hanks is excellent I think the standout performance is from Mark Rylance who plays the Russian spy , Rudolf Abel . His understated dour acting is brilliant to watch. If you are expecting an action thriller then you will be disappointed. It's not that type of film. This is pure drama and an enjoyable one at that. I'm not convinced this is the classic some people are talking about.","10/10"
"Bridge of Spies","regula1","16 October 2015","In my mind, there are only two kinds of movie: good and bad. What makes a good movie good depends on a variety of factors that boil down to one thing: does it satisfy the needs of the audience? If you go to an action movie, chances are you go into it expecting many things to blow up and not a bunch of romantic interludes. If you get a lot of booms, then you are satisfied, or if you get a lot of romance, you will probably be dissatisfied.""Bridge of Spies"" is a very satisfying movie.This is not an action film by any stretch of the imagination, mind you. Only three or four booms occur and only a handful of gunshots are seen. This is not a spy film, either. True, the main points of the film centers around two ""spies."" For those not well versed in history, here's the set-up:In 1957, Rudolph Abel, played very simply yet effectively by Mark Rylance, is arrested in New York by the FBI on charges of espionage. Appointed to his defense is Tom Hanks playing James Donovan, an insurance lawyer with a good family struggling to raise his children in the midst of the Cold War atmosphere of paranoia.In 1960, Francis Gary Powers is shot down flying a U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union and is captured alive. In 1961, the Berlin Wall is erected, completely separating East Berlin from West. Finally, in 1962, a prisoner exchange is arranged for Powers and Abel in Berlin, on the Glienicke Bridge, known as ""the bridge of spies.""Donovan is given the unenviable task of defending a self-admitted spy, putting him in a position much like that of John Adams who took the case of the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. Hated by his own people for defending values that everyone in America should value, Hanks' Donovan must wrestle with his morals in the face of people who have bought into their own propaganda and forgotten what is truly at stake.Spielberg puts the values of America at the heart of this movie, but doesn't rub it in your face. On the contrary, through the simple but powerful character interactions and very simple background music, Spielberg lets the audience come to the conclusion for themselves the results of sticking to your values, even when you don't want to, with implications that easily apply today (think Guantanamo.)For those interested in history, the set directors did a wonderful job showing Cold War-era America and Berlin, Berlin especially. It's amazing to think that even 17 years after the end of World War II, East Berlin still had large sections of the city in ruins.Don't look for anything fancy, but don't look at anything at face value. Appreciate the simple yet smart repartee that Hanks shares with characters such as Abel, FBI agents, and Soviet and East German bureaucrats. Reflect on the messages that this film sends in parallel images seen throughout the film. Hopefully, you will come out of the theater feeling ... satisfied.","9/10"
"Bridge of Spies","peterp-450-298716","3 February 2016","""I am Irish, you are German. But what makes us Americans? Just one thing, The rulebook. We call it the Constitution and agree to the rules, and that's what makes us American.""Spielberg returns to the history of war long after ""War Horse"", a story of a stallion with a Lassie attitude during WWI, but not with heroic images of the battlefield as in ""Saving Private Ryan"". ""Bridge of Spies"" takes place during the Cold War. A period during which espionage was commonplace and super powers completely distrusted each other. As a result a whole arsenal of nuclear missiles were aiming at the main cities in both continents. Spies infiltrated into society and gave the authorities and agencies all sorts of secret information. And those spies just look like we imagined them. Dignified dressed men with a long coat and a stylish trilby, shyly and cautiously moving through the crowd and revealing a rolled up piece of paper somewhere out of a wall. After that they deciphered this message by means of an ingenious mechanism and a complicated decoding key in their sober furnished apartment. And that message contained the new coordinates where the next message was hidden. Well, in my childhood I imagined it would be like that. The most successful part of this film are the overall eye-catching images and decorations. The setting looks absolutely beautiful with lots of details. The city of New York in the 60s with its boulevards full of beautiful cars, the costumes, the atmosphere and family values in that period. Thus we are introduced to the the family of James Donovan (Tom Hanks). A typical American model family, residing in a house decorated in atom style, elegantly dressed in the fashion of those days and with a disciplined lifestyle. In contrast, a bit later we are witnessing the construction of the Berlin wall that splits this city into two parts. A grim, postwar, snow covered Berlin where heartbreaking scenes take place.Key figure in this espionage drama is James Donovan, an ordinary lawyer who's specialized in legal cases with insurance companies. From one moment to the other he needs to defend the recently arrested Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). In those days anyone or anything that has to do with communism is automatically suspicious and should be condemned immediately. This means that this cold-blooded spy can't count on a fair trial. But they forgot about Donovan, because this principled lawyer convulsively believes in the constitutional rule that everyone, no matter what their crime or origin, is entitled to a defense and isn't guilty until proved otherwise. The result is that the hostile public opinion isn't only focused on Abel but also on Donovan, someone of Irish descent but American at heart.Did ""Bridge of spies"" make a huge impression on me? No not really. Not that the perfectionistic images are disappointing. Or that the acting is abominably bad. But because I wasn't waiting for the umpteenth historical war-documentary. The used clichéd contradictions between the two superpowers was a bit to obvious. For instance, the circumstances of Abel's imprisonment seemed more comfortable than those of the American prisoners in Eastern Europe. And the cunning way Spielberg bypasses the historical character and gives it a more adventurous and heroic touch, shows that he must make concessions to Hollywood's management. On the other hand it was a relief to see that the image of a spy is shown in a realistic way. So don't expect James Bond or Ethan Hunt situations, filled with impetuous action and death-defying stunts while making use of high tech gadgets. The spies in ""Bridge of spies"" are ordinary characters who perform their ""spy-work"" in a simple and less spectacular way.And finally, the importance of a star actor such as Tom Hanks is of course crucial for this film.Hanks is and will always remain one of my favorite actors. A charismatic and versatile actor who turns each role into a masterpiece. He dominates in every movie. Without Hanks this would only be a typical historical drama that has taken shape in the mind of the master himself, Steven Spielberg.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","ethanbresnett","22 February 2021","Spielberg and Hanks, what more could a movie fan want? Individually the two rarely miss the mark with their projects. Stick them together and the results are often sensational. I wouldn't class Bridge of Spies as sensational, but it is a gripping, stylish and engaging thriller nonetheless.The story is remarkable and one that I'm very glad to have learned about. We follow Hanks' lawyer James Donovan as his case to defend an alleged Soviet spy drags him deep into the Cold War. There are some great themes explored, and the performances are exceptional. Hanks is a cut above the rest and delivers his dialogue with such sharpness and wit. Bridge of Spies really is all about the dialogue, which is always excellent. Don't go in expecting an action packed thriller. This is more John le Carre esque, playing out like a game of chess.My only criticisms of this film would be that it never quite reached the heights I was expecting or hoping for. The level of peril always felt quite low. I was hooked don't get me wrong, but the ending felt fairly obvious and as a result there was no great danger or suspense. Then there were the characters. I wasn't that enamoured with any of them. The film was more about the events and how they unfolded, and characterisation and development appeared to take a back seat.Aside from this, everything about Bridge of Spies was great. The direction from Spielberg was expectedly fantastic, Hanks was so magnetic and watchable, and the score, sets and costumes set a brilliant tone and style for the film.Very enjoyable and most definitely worth a watch.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","phatdan","26 October 2015","Propaganda plays out in this latest Spielberg effort. At the start we see a Russian spy arrested by the FBI. He is a most pleasant fellow played by Mark Rylance. Evidently typecast for the part, he is as soft- spoken and sincere as he was in 'Angels and Insects'. With a pleasant, Scottish brogue, he exhibits a spy with profound integrity. The depiction of the American response to his escaping the death penalty is embarrassingly sophomoric (Actually, as I can remember as a teenager, there was little or no public outcry at the sentence). The incompetence of American military intelligence is also depicted (70,000 ft wasn't high enough for the U-2 spy plane to avert being shot down). But military incompetence has always been an easy target, especially to a liberally biased Hollywood. Nonetheless, it is well-crafted and enjoyable. And, propaganda evens out as we see the Berlin Wall erected, and the consequent brutality of Soviet tyranny.","9/10"

"Bridge of Spies","steven_torrey","6 December 2015","I'm 70 and I seem recall as a kid at least once getting under my desk to protect us from nuclear bombs. But I think only once. Too young to know of Russian Spy Rudolf Abel; but I clearly remember Gary Powers U-2 incident and the subsequent exchange of Abel and Powers.I thought the drama taut, well crafted, suspenseful. Interesting characterization of Abel (Mark Rylance) and Donovan (Tom Hanks). (I refuse to say 'great acting'--that is why they get paid millions.) The film conveyed the greyness of those years--the greyness not only in America but in East Berlin. The sense of being slightly depressed about something--though in East Berlin there was lots to be depressed about.Donovan challenges Abel, he challenges the court case, he challenges the CIA, the US Military, the East German thugs, the East German politburo. And in the end--he gets the release of not only Gary Powers but an American economics student--Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers)-- who got himself captured when he crossed into East Berlin. And crossing into East Berlin should not be seen as some easy cross the border jaunt; it was fraught with peril of being arrested as a spy on trumped up charges and incarcerated and interrogated mercilessly for any length of time. So Donovan crossing into East Berlin took huge guts and risks.I was never certain of who or what Wolfgang Vogel (Sebastian Koch) was--was he an embassy functionary or an East German Communist Party Apparatchik? In the end, he clearly was not to be trusted.Rudolf Abel was a Russian Spy and in the movie he aids Donovan or tolerates Donovan in being certain that Pryor is released as well as Powers--something the Russians agreed to by releasing Pryor at Checkpoint Charlie while Powers and Abel are exchanged at the Glienicke Bridge.While in the movie, Donovan is portrayed as an insurance attorney recruited for Abel's criminal defense, and later recruited by the CIA Allen Dulles for the prisoner exchange, the film neglects to mention that he was also employed during the war in the OSS (precursor to the CIA). So his experience in the world of espionage was recognized and justifies choice for him in these sensitive assignments. So when he goes to Judge Mortimer W. Byers ((Dakin Matthews) to request Abel be sentenced to time in prison because the US may need him for tactical negotiation for a future potential prisoner exchange, he is working from some insight into the world of espionage. The film fails to make Donovan's relationship to this world of espionage clear.There was a sort of Walter Mitty moment in the movie, when at the end, his family learns from the television news that Donovan was in reality a special Envoy to President Kennedy in a top secret mission. How cool is that: every child wants their father to be a secret agent in reality. It was just one light touch among several that gave the spy thriller an added dimension.For escapist drama but well grounded in reality, it was really a great movie--well worth the time. And apparently the film hews pretty closely to actual events--given the inevitable need for film drama.","8/10"
"Bridge of Spies","Yelitza-screenwriting-student","25 October 2015","Loved this film!The title is actually literal! It's all revealed in the last sequences of the film. Wonderful impact! But watch carefully seeds are planted at the very beginning of the film to guide your mind into the end. The pace of the film is perfect – no time for boredom, and enough time for exposition to understand what's going on and keep the suspense. Some apparent loose strings come together at the end—it all makes sense and it's wonderful.The world building is realistic: Spielberg shows us the destruction of East Germany, the horrors of the wall, and the economic and social devastation. Of course Spielberg is a superstar in this territory—he's done war masterpiece films before. He knows how to compose images that stir curiosity and deep emotions. The writers did a superb job with a sequence of scenes that makes us (the audience) care very much for Jim (Tom Hanks) and his missions. We understand him. We want him to succeed: he's a man of altruism, honor, generosity, and justice. He's a warm and kind husband, father, and citizen. He sacrifices his reputation. And he's so smart! He uses his knowledge in probabilistic insurance models to make decisions on his spy negotiations. Brilliant.When Jim says that the Russian spy should be given incarceration and not electric chair because he could be used for an exchange, in case the Russians get an American spy this gave me the hint of what was coming later. Even though there's some predictability, the whole situation of an American lawyer in treacherous enemy territory to hold negotiations is incredibly suspenseful.I was on the edge of my seat I laughed with Tom Hanks mannerisms and sense of humor (his trademark shouts and gestures) in rough times. I got teary in the last sequence of the exchange, and how Jim's kindness won the Russian's spy's heart.Tom Hanks is the master of showing emotional engagement and astute acting. He is a delight to watch on the big screen. The rest of the cast does a fine job and thanks to them the best and the worst of Jim's character shows up on the screen. Conflict and suspense are part of every minute of this film! Jim took measured risks—for the sake of doing the right thing—and he succeeded. Wonderful 2 hours! Loved it!I was super surprised to see the energetic sequence of the airplane taken down by a Russian missile! An unexpected exciting moment of action and thrill! Because of this event, at midpoint in the film things flip upside down for Jim – he has to go to East Berlin to negotiate 1 for 1 exchange, but while he is there, he learns there's a student that happened to be at the wrong time and got captured and he makes it a 2 for 1which becomes an incredible difficult and dangerous task This is a masterpiece to be absorbed and relived many times. Cheers.","8/10"
"Iron Man","TheLittleSongbird","12 August 2014","When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox","9/10"
"Iron Man","SnoopyStyle","7 December 2013","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a hard playing billionaire genius. He is captured in Afghanistan after demonstrating his newest weapon. He is forced to create new weapons for his captor. Instead he makes an armored suit to escape. He also makes an arc reactor to keep his heart going and shrapnel from killing him. Once back in the States, he moves his company to concentrate on arc reactor technology and stop weapons manufacturing.This is all RDJ. He and he alone makes Iron Man work. It's doubtful if anybody could have done it better. It's certain that he's made it next to impossible to replace him. Director Jon Favreau has built around him the dazzling array of tech fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow as his Girl Friday. It is RDJ's fast talking, quick wit, and personal history that makes him the perfect Tony Stark. Great character, fun movie.","8/10"
"Iron Man","bjoernidler","7 October 2018","In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: 
Is Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.","8/10"
"Iron Man","repojack","7 February 2021","MCU 2021 MarathonMCU #1:Iron Man was my favorite Marvel hero. As a teen I collected 1-150 with the main series. I doodled the Iron Man helmet during class at high school when bored.So it was a huge surprise when this came out in 2008 and it was so freaking GOOD! Jon Favreau, the guy that had done Elf and Zathura (the Zumanji sequel) had just started a cinematic revolution? What!?!? (And Favreau is doing it again with The Mandalorian).Robert Downey Jr. was made for the part of Tony Stark. The origin story was modernized and handled well. They included most of the early Iron Man suits from the comics. They took the time showing the more modern invention of the suit and the challenges of making it work (e.g. maneuvering with the repulsors).I finally understood what Spiderman's fans felt like when Sam Raimi's Spiderman series became a massive pop culture sensation years earlier. Fantastic!There are issues. Pacing mostly. Jeff Bridges is too much the stereotypical villain with an over-the-top fight scene at the end.This was the beginning of the MCU world building effort which was more ""slight-of-hand"" in the earlier movies -- Stark's OCD making itself evident, that Shield guy at the party, and Samuel Jackson pinging Stark about Avengers in the end credits.It began and ended with Iron Man. That makes me happy.""I am Iron Man""","8/10"
"Iron Man","jhudson-11704","27 July 2017","With a B-list superhero, a risky lead actor, a genre that hasn't really done much other than say Nolan's Batman, this movie had a lot to prove. Wow, did it ever. It proved that superhero movies can be realistic, emotional, funny and have highly entertaining action. This is the movie to launch the MCU, and started the shared universe that DC comics and other franchises are following.Let's start with the number one reason why this movie is so good: Robert Downey Jr. I am so glad that Jon Favreau kept pressing the studio to make sure RDJ had this role because he completely nails it. He effortlessly portrays the cool, sarcastic, alcoholic, playboy that I don't even think he's acting. He's clearly not perfect as he is the guy we think is awesome but don't necessarily want to be. This role is basically synonymous with RDJ now because you can't think of Tony Stark without immediately thinking of RDJ. Iron Man wasn't a househeld name before but thanks to RDJ's performance, it is now.The action in this movie is incredible as you get to see him fly around, take on terrorist cells and fight the main villain. What I even found to more intriguing is Stark's entire time building his suit, both in the Afghan cave and in his garage because it is amazing to see his genius at work, while still being snarky and basically a tool.The writing and humor is also very good in this movie. I read that a lot of the lines, especially RDJ's were improv, which is able to keep this movie very fresh, not Rotten Tomatoes style, but it helps a lot by breaking the molds of superhero movies.A couple complaints in this film is the pacing and the final villain. The pacing starts off very well, not really rushing into him being Iron Man, establishing his character very well before his abilities. Then the final battle comes around and it's basically just an evil version of his character, which sort of works with the problem of his technology getting into wrong hands, but the fact that it's just fighting a mirror is kind of boring. The final battle comes around pretty quick and it resolved fairly quick as if they are trying to wrap it up really quickly. I did like Bridges' Obadiah Stane with his intimidating yet charming persona but in the end he was just a reverse of Iron Man, not that interesting.+ Robert Downey Jr + Fresh, new start for superhero movies + Writing and pacing (mostly) + Action and Humor - Final Villain Final Score: 9.3/10","9/10"
"Iron Man","planktonrules","12 April 2009","I finally saw this movie last night on DVD. Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office, I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it, but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already, mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead, let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also, I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally, while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film, it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog, but the end was all special effects. Still, I must admit that they were very, very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character ""Pepper Potts"" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular, Graham Chapman, coined the term ""Pepperpot"" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged ""ladies"".UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance, the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film.","9/10"

"Iron Man","jaredmobarak","29 April 2008","There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flicklet's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out backstory. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, ""no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can."" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liason, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show ""Dinner for Five"" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the backstory and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Smells_Like_Cheese","2 May 2008","Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.Tony Stark, rich, handsome, incredibly wealthy, has it all. He also creates war weapons, when he goes to Afghanastan to introduce a new missile, he is captured and told to create the missile for the terrorists. But Tony has other plans, he creates a metal suit and escapes, he goes back home and announces that he wants to retire and close down Stark industries due to the violence he saw. But when he learns that the weapons of his are in the wrong hands, he realizes that maybe he could re-create a metal suit and become Iron Man, the incredible machine to save man kind.Iron Man is a sure fire hit that I'm sure you won't want to miss. It has everything you could want for a comic book film: action, humor, a great cast, romance, and ultimate effects that just get you excited. Even the soundtrack gets you pumped up and ready to root for Iron Man. The only complaint, as much as the action was cool, I wish it wasn't the war on terrorism they used, I know it's part of the story, but it hits so close, that it may seem inappropriate. The climax, a little cliff hanger, but I'm already smelling a sequel for next year probably. But Iron Man is a fun movie that all ages could enjoy, Iron Man is the new Spider Man for 2008! 8/10","8/10"
"Iron Man","DICK STEEL","30 April 2008","With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.This may irk the fervent fans of Iron Man, but face it, the superhero belonged to Tier B where superheroes are concerned, languishing behind easily recognizable peers who already have movie after movie being made. But thanks to the advancement in digital technology, bringing Iron Man to life no longer consisted of the prospect and worrying thought of having a man running about in a rubber suit passing it off as metal, the way Ultraman would have been done, complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and fool the visual sensory. Here, we have a very detailed rendering of the entire design from scratch to final modification, and we're in at every step of the way, with many cheeky and sometimes a tad implausible scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in.I thought Iron Man the story worked because of stark (pardon the pun) similarities with Batman Begins, also an origin story which took its time to dwell on the man behind the suit, nevermind at the sacrifice of having less action sequences, or by not giving the fans what they want through the showcase of more than the basic powers. Advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel, and as the first movie used to establish its characters, I felt that it succeeded, given too that it had a cast of capables (just like Batman Begins had) to pull the movie through without resorting to over the top and campy performances, starting of course with the lead in Robert Downey Jr.In a nutshell, Downey is Tony Stark through and through. His affinity for the character shines, and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own personal, and Stark's life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle. He was allowed to become a Two-Face of sorts, on one hand being and later acting out his flamboyance self whose mission in life was the continuation of his father's legacy of Stark Industries, a weapons conglomerate, versus his personal mission in ridding his own weapons from the hands of the bad guys, now updated to be freedom fighters in the Middle East. The dialogue contained within each scene of Stark's, except perhaps during captivity, is full of one-liners done in double quick time, you probably would think it boiled down to a whole host of natural ad-libbing.But while Starks spends significant amount of time in his unsecured basement building his masterpiece, his human interaction come in the form of faithful secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who actually, for the first time I admit, looked really good on screen as Stark's most trusted aide, bringing about some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the two characters of opposite sex, more so than any other comic book movie I have seen. And good friend from the air force Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) complete the circle of trust who knows of Stark's secret identity, and you'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the toss of a teaser of a certain War Machine appearance should the sequel be out. Who's the main villain in the movie? It points the finger at Corporations, or at least here, the weapons manufacturers and the shady deals that go through in the name of profit, the sole objective for any corporation's existence. And Jeff Bridges, in a rare villainous role, got to personify that greed and wrestle for absolute power just like the trailer already suggested. While his performance is refreshing as he disappears behind the ball head and bushy beard, you could see his motivation and how the plot would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for Iron Man to duke it out in a, sad to say, ordinary finale which any audience would probably be able to stay a step ahead.As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of similarities with the Dark Knight of Gotham in Christopher Nolan's reboot, but more so because of properties inherent with the likeness between Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day job to pursue their ""hobby"", both have to suffer personal tragedies in order to wake up to the cruel world, and in the movie, both fall prey to the corporate raider type, spend time perfecting their suit of war, have assistants they would trust their lives with, and of course save them from impending doom, and a finales set at their facilities.But Iron Man is still a special effects extravaganza offering a thrill ride especially when he goes into battle mode, and without a doubt, Robert Downey Jr probably should be credited for raising the profile of this once Tier-B character, to perhaps becoming more recognizable now, and obviously, expanding the fan base of this weaponry filled suit of metal, which of course, in this origin movie, we were only given a glimpse of its potential. can everyone now spell sequel and clamour for more please? Iron Man has set the bar for the other upcoming comic book movies to try and surpass this summer season!","10/10"
"Iron Man","darkmax","30 April 2008","Fortunately, I'm not one easily influenced by some users' negative comments. These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.Now I would say that this movie has slow but steady momentum-building. It is a movie for people who has never known Iron Man in the comic series. The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.Acting was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far. Effects were believable and not overwhelmingly CGI, except for the tank scene.This movie, however, has sequel written all over it. We know that because there are many scenes that could have lead to more.It's well worth its ticket price.","9/10"
"Iron Man","The_Film_Cricket","1 April 2014","Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"" brings the superhero genre to a rock star status. Frankly, it needs it. It is a breath of fresh air after the Superman and Batman pictures which have been so vapid and overproduced that they forgot to be fun. This movie overcomes all the handicaps that have kept the others down including the labored weight of the origin story. Yes, Tony Stark builds and Iron Man suit and becomes a superhero, but the script isn't belabored by getting all the pieces in place. This is a fun movie that allows it's hero to learn from his mistakes.What makes ""Iron Man"" work is that Favreau and his writers realize that a man in an iron suit can only be interesting as far as the special effects can carry it. So, their movie is heavily weighted toward the performance of Robert Downey Jr. who, as Tony Stark, is given free range over his best gift, his mouth. Stark is old money, a billionaire whose company builds on the legacy of his late father, building weapons to – quote – keep the peace – end quote. As the movie opens, he's in a convoy in Afghanistan, drink in hand, headed to a presentation of his new weapon system. You don't have to have superpowers to guess that his convoy is ambushed by members of a terrorist cell who want the famed metallurgist to build them a missile. What does he build instead? Well, just look at the title.What a guy this is. He has enough many to keep a small country in luxury for decades. He can build anything with a hammer and welding torch. He lives on a vast mountaintop estate in Malibu, California. He has jets, cars, and even a robot butler named J.A.R.V.I.S. whose voice sounds suspiciously like Paul Bettaney. He's also got a Barnum-like gift for salesmanship, selling arms around the world to keep things in line. This is caused him grief. He's been called a Merchant of Death, a man whose company deals in making war profits. He argues vehemently that his company helps keep the world at peace by fighting back against those who bring about war. That builds the bulk of the movie as Stark builds the Iron Man suit, his company.After an incident in Afghanistan, he decides to shut down the weapons division and focus on building his iron suit. That doesn't sit well with his second-in-command Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), and therein lies our villain. Bridges makes a good one. He's familiar to us as a nice guy, but here he proves that he can convincingly play a villain. It's not just a standard evil villain. There's something about Stane that gives he fuel to want what Stark has. It's a good performance.Also good is Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Starks's personal assistant and love interest. She could have been stuck in a thankless role, but Paltrow has been given something much more substantial to work with. She isn't all lips and glossy eyes. She has a brain and she tires of her employer's wreckless personality, that is, until she falls into his arms. The chemistry between Paltrow and Downey is something special.Yet, the greatest gift here is Robert Downey Jr. who's on the comeback trail. He's a wonderful actor who fell into a personal crisis but now seems to be on the road back. Recently, he's been turning in magnificent work in ""A Scanner Darkly"", ""Zodiac"", ""Tropic Thunder"" and the little-seen ""Lucky You."" He has a God-given talent and it's nice to finally see him getting back to great work. He gives a better performance here might seem necessary. He could have done a lot of posturing, but he gives Stark a personality that is light-hearted. It's a joy to watch.So is the movie. Jon Favreau has created a film that is exciting and fun. The script gives us more than we might expect, and it isn't all rock-em-sock-em crash and bash (though the movie employs those things). It isn't overwhelmed by marketing. This is a smart movie, with a lot of energy and style.","10/10"
"Iron Man","sacflyzone","23 April 2008","Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film.","10/10"
"Iron Man","ffiisshh","21 April 2008","WOW WOW WOW.This is the movie I have been waiting for for a very long time. I am an avid Ironman reader. I have collected the comics all my life (from #1 in 1968 to the latest in 2008)...40 years of Ironman. Since I was a kid, I used to say to my friends that they should make an Ironman movie, but everyone laughed and said that the special effects would look ridiculous...mind you, that was back in like in the early 1980's. But, now we are in the age of CGI, and what an age it is. Just for you Ironman fans, to see him come to life with such spectacular graphics is reason enough to spend your hard-earned $10. The plot is also pretty well thought out, and the acting is just fine. What better pick could you have for Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.? (just wait for the sequels when they can delve into his alcoholism...Mr. Downey has been there and beyond...that's probably why they chose him for the role...fore-thought)The rest of the cast is right on par, as well. The pace is brisk, and the whole thing works as a great addition to the Marvel Universe in the Cinema!! Enjoy!","8/10"
"Iron Man","Joejoesan","16 April 2008","From the first moment Robert Downey Jr comes on screen as Tony Stark, you know that this movie can't go wrong. We are in some desert in Afghanistan and wisecracking Stark tells something about his playboy life to some soldiers. Yes, this ain't no nerdy Peter Parker or tortured Wolverine. Our hero is a person who generally enjoys life (and women) and has no second thoughts on how he lives it. Without any doubt, of all the superheroes that exist, Tony Stark is the coolest person there is! But of course his bubble bursts when Stark is kidnapped by terrorists and forced to reproduce his killing missile, the Jericho. The sacrifice of a fellow scientist makes him humble and after his spectacular escape Stark decides to better his life. No more manufacturing of weapons for Stark Industries. From now on Stark wants to help his fellow men. Although this decision impresses some (like Stark's secretary Paltrow) it also infuriates others (like Stark's partner Jeff Bridges). This all leads to a action-packed finale in which Iron Man must face a deadly enemy...Iron Man is the big Robert Downey Jr. show. Downey not only brings humor and flamboyance to his role, he also manages to make you believe that an egocentric person can indeed change into a real humanitarian. The scene in which he realizes that someone is willing to make a sacrifice in order for him to escape is even a moving one. Well done. Downey is really a great actor with great charisma.But there is a lot more to Iron Man. There are four or five big action scenes. The first four are so great (the escape from the cave and a sequence involving an Afghan village) that the last one - the big finale - disappoints a little bit. But that's okay. There are also a lot of smaller scenes to be enjoyed, focusing on the relationship between Downey and Paltrow and the development of the Iron Man armour. Jeff Bridges is always great to look at, although his role could have been played by several other actors. Maybe his storyline is the weakest of the film. His betrayal is no surprise, but his early involvement in this is hard to believe. Iron Man is a spectacular and funny popcorn ride that not only has great action scenes, but also some great actors. Hopefully it will do very well at the box office, because I can't wait to see Iron Man 2. Enjoy!PS: no Samuel Jackson in this version either!8,5 out of 10","9/10"
"Iron Man","Chrysanthepop","9 May 2008","Until May 2008, the few releases this year that I've seen ranged from below average to downright rubbish with the exception of two movies. One being 'Iron Man'. This is the movie we have been waiting for this year. So does it match up to expectations? Hell yes! On the surface, 'Iron Man' isn't very different from other superhero films but on the other hand it isn't like any other superhero movie. This one has rich characters, it perfectly blends humour, drama, action and it has heart, all of which are presented on screen in a wonderful way that keeps the viewer staring at the screen right till the end. The writing is great as 'Iron Man' sticks to the main story all the way. I liked how Downey Jr's Tony Stark grows from this carefree business-minded tech-tycoon who's only concern is Stark Industries to a man with a mission to save the world and in the process he still stays the same person as he maintains his sense of humour, his courage and his integrity. The dialogues, especially Starks's one-liners are sharp, witty and funny. This movie is an introduction to the famous title character thus those expecting only action from start to end (like 'Transformers') may be disappointed to an extent. But for me there was enough action along with substance to make it a hugely enjoyable experience.Jon Favreau is proving to be a more versatile director and his impressive filmography, both as actor and director, prove that he's experimented with different kinds of cinema. 'Iron Man' wouldn't have been an easy film to direct but Favreau does a magnificent job. The CGI is excellent as I loved how much attention was given to detail and how the viewer is shown every step of the making of Iron Man. Of course, there's some humour added to lighten up the mood instead of technologically overloading the viewers.'Iron Man' is just the movie that Robert Downey Jr. needed and it couldn't have come at a better time. At a time, when this talented actor's performances were hardly getting enough notice, 'Iron Man' brings him back to recognition. After seeing him, one would conclude that the part was made only for Downey Jr. His dialogue delivery seems so natural that it would be hard to tell whether he was acting, if the scenes were taken out of context. I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow has ever looked better. Though the role does not allow her to really stretch her acting, Potts isn't just a typical superhero's dame. She is Tony's confidant and the one who supports him through thick and thin. Paltrow provides the necessary charisma, sex appeal and soul that makes Pepper Potts shine and she shares a sizzling chemistry with her male lead. Terrence Howard has a smaller role as Tony's good friend but there's a hint that he might have a more prominent role if a sequel is made. Finally, there's Jeff Bridges as the villain. An odd yet brilliant choice as the actor is refreshing and like his costar, he too needed an 'Iron Man' to give his career a boost.I noticed that some people were complaining that Muslims/Middle Easterners were portrayed as bad guys just like in any other American movie but I would like to state that this is no 'Vantage Point'. Here, these people weren't portrayed as terrorists working on their own but as men hired for a specific reason (I won't say more to give away spoilers). So I just thought to briefly clarify that this is no anti-Islamic or anti-anything (except, well okay, anti-weaponry) movie. It's a movie for everyone.Perhaps the story itself isn't anything novel which is what makes it somewhat similar to other superhero movies, but the treatment of it and its execution is quite unique. Add to that a fine cast and dazzling special effects among many things, this is the summer movie experience I've been waiting for in 2008. I wonder what else this summer has to offer as I doubt that it would succeed in providing anything close to the sheer entertainment of 'Iron Man'.","10/10"
"Iron Man","sidfargas","15 April 2008","All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Mark my words, Iron Man is such a movie. I've been privileged enough to view an advanced screening and, honestly, it's the best big budget movie that I've seen in many years. It hits a high standard of excellence for mass audiences by combining humor, a smart plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. The special effects and CGI are probably the best I've ever seen in terms of relatable effects. They're not over the top and don't overwhelm your senses. What's even more remarkable is this movie will surprise a lot of people with its depth while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Iron Man delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.The cast is obviously stellar but that doesn't always mean greatness. (American Gangster, Street Kings anyone?) I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Downey himself delivers one of the greatest performances in a comic adaptation film EVER. Maybe it's because the character itself is one of the most complex and intriguing that any genre has to offer but that doesn't diminish just what a home run Downey has hit. They took the character seriously but still remembered to include fun and humor. I almost can't convey how much I enjoyed his performance.Minor SPOILER....My only real complaint is the rumor of a Sam Jackson cameo was not fulfilled. He is even listed here as playing the character of Nick Fury. He did not appear in the cut that I saw. After browsing, it's been offered that his cameo was probably just removed for the early screenings. I hope that's true and they put it back for the final cut. This means I'll just HAVE to see this movie again. LUCKY ME!","8/10"
"Iron Man","disdressed12","23 November 2008","this is one movie that was way better than i thought it would be.it's not just an action movie.it's also a smart,cleverly written movie,with some great dialogue.it also incorporates real global problems,serving as a sort of commentary on our times.it's not preachy,it just shows how far we've progressed.or maybe regressed as a society.there is also the theme of redemption in the movie.i mentioned the good dialogue.an example of that is the witty banter between Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.)and his assistant Pepper Pots(Gwyneth Paltrow).beyond that though,Stark is generally witty.i liked the origin story of the film,though i can't say whether or not it's accurate to the comic book.naturally,there are some great action sequences,especially the flying scenes and the combat scenes.and that suit is very impressive,both in looks and functionality.as to the cast,Downey is very good as Stark/Iron Man.Paltrow is very likable as Pepper Potts.Terrance Howard is good as Stark's military friend Rhodey,but i feel he was underutilized.oh well,maybe the sequel will rectify that.i heard that Howard is being replaced in the sequel by Don Cheadle.nothing against Cheadle,but i think they ought to stick with Howard,since he originated the character in the film.but the best actor in the bunch,in my opinion is Jeff Bridges,who gives a William Hurt type performance,understated,yet simmering with passion and charisma.that's just my opinion.anyway,,the movie is fun and engaging,but it's no empty headed action movie.not that there's anything wrong with that.no,this is a smart movie with heart and soul.my vote for Iron Man: 9/10","8/10"
"Iron Man","g-bodyl","17 November 2008","Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called ""Ten Rings"" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion.

"Iron Man","jdkraus","16 May 2008","From all the hype I heard about this film, I decided to see it. I thought this would be another superhero movie disaster that has too much CGI and no plot, but I was proved wrong. Most superhero films don't have an academy award winning script, but ""Iron Man"" pulled off with a decent story that has no holes. I was very impressed by it, particularly with a surprising anti-gun/war message delivered nicely by Robert Downey Jr.To my surprise, Downey did a pretty good job as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He's funny, entertaining, and a hero that could easily be liked. Terrence Howard as the amusing Jim Rhodes and Gwyneth Paltrow (beautiful as ever) as Iron Man's assistant are pleasant additions to the film. Jeff Bridges wasn't a bad villain, although I did not find him to be in the caliber of Jack Nicholson as ""The Joker"" or even Willem Dafoe as the ""Green Goblin"".The one thing that I did not like about the movie though was the lack of romance. Whether it is Batman or Spider-man, the good guy always had a girl. Gwyneth Paltrow's character can be considered a damsel in distress at the end, but the relationship never grows between her and Iron Man. I'm not trying to sound like I am a lover of chick flicks, but in my opinion, a good superhero should always have a girl, or at least someone to love.Overall this is a great film with a solid plot, decent acting, and wonderful CGI that is not overdone. For you popcorn lovers, this is your ticket. 8/10","8/10"

Jeff Bridges was great, I thought Paltrow developed well as the film went on.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the acting and the visuals.

Perfect Embodiment of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and the Rest Contributing to the Fun. The Director, Jon Favreau, was a Risk. Hardly Known for Big-Budget Action Movies, He Captures the Spirit of the Comics and turned in an absolutely Brilliant Film from Top to Bottom.Fans of the Silver-Age Comics will No Doubt be Impressed. When Iron Man First Appeared in ""Tales of Suspense"" #39, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were in the Embryonic Stages of Reinventing Comics and the Marvel Super Hero Line was being Tested and no one At the Time (except maybe the Fans) had a Clue what They were Witnessing. In the Origin of Iron Man and for a while, the Character was this Hulky, Bulky, Tank-Like Hero, in a Clunky Iron Suit. Not the Sleek Hot Rod Red Iron Man to Come Later. In the Film, this Likeness can be Seen in the Opening where Tony Stark Creates the Character ""in a cave with a box of scraps"". This is a Spot-On Recreation from the Comics Origin Issues and it is a Great Insider's Inspiration and a Fine Tribute to the Movie's Paper Origins.This is just one of the Charms about Iron Man, The Movie.

"Iron Man","anaconda-40658","3 June 2015","Iron Man (2008): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Shaun Toub: Explosive action adventure about the unstoppable. Tony Stark is a genius weapons manufacturer whom is kidnapped in Afghanistan during a missile demonstration. In captivity he builds a suit of armor that would become his Iron Man persona. Director Jon Favreau establishes a plot that flows without pause. Favreau previously sprung success with the Christmas comedy Elf. Robert Downey Jr. plays off the sarcasm of Stark. He is wealthy yet intelligent as he must survive several months of captivity as well as confront a corrupt mind that was formerly on par with himself. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his loyal assistant who rises above being a standard damsel. She is instrumental in his recovery as well as becoming a safe source for his ideas. Jeff Bridges plays the villain whom uses Stark's weapons against him. They were friends at first until he becomes corrupt and musters into something of opposite proportions to Stark. Only Terrence Howard seems cardboard in his standard military role and friend that hardly elevates beyond routine. Shaun Toub plays a captive of Stark's but the character is apparently changed from his comic book identity. Tremendous special effects using Iron Man's initiation as a weapon as a statement regarding arms forces. Score: 9 ½ / 10","8/10"
"Iron Man","snoozejonc","27 December 2020","A billionaire weapons engineer builds a flying suit of armour.Iron Man is a highly enjoyable superhero origin movie powered by the charisma of Robert Downey Jr.The plot is a fairly simple redemption story that sees Tony Stark become Iron Man and do battle with villains both abroad and domestic.Special effects and cool technology reigns supreme as we are presented with a multitude of visual and auditory spectacle. The suit feels real and it provides scenes that both thrill and generate humour.There are some nice themes explored around warfare, weapons manufacturing and blood money. The character of Stark really is a good opportunity to address topics like this.Downey is perfectly cast and it's his personality that carries the film and entertains above all. Supporting performances work perfectly, particularly Gwynneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges.The soundtrack acquired for the movie enhances the rock star persona of Stark and probably rejuvenated sales of certain heavy metal albums.Ninety percent of the movie works for me until we get to the final showdown where I found myself somewhat out of the swing of it and at one point became highly aware I was watching two animated robotic characters smashing each other about.The final scene is excellent and a cool subversion of the standard identity cliches usually found in the superhero genre.","9/10"
"Iron Man","southdavid","1 February 2022","Having powered back through the Avengers films recently, and the ""Spider-man"" MCU series - I asked my son which set of films he'd like to see next and he chose ""Iron Man"". So, one Saturday afternoon we stuck it on and though some of the effects are starting to betray it's age a little - it's still a really solid base upon which the MCU was built.Having been captured by a terrorist organisation, billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) is ordered to create a missile for them, but instead creates a weaponised suit of armour that he uses to escape. Having seen the real usage of his weapons, he decides to withdraw Stark Enterprises from that industry and focuses on refining the suit idea making it one of the most powerful weapons in the world, but one that remains in his hands. These plans do not sit well with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), C. O. O of Stark Enterprises, who looks to remove his protégé from the company, one way or another.Again, it's interesting to see the film again, seeing it as it is now - the first step on a 25 film (so far) odyssey that would take us across the Galaxy and the Multiverse. Tonally, it's pretty much there from the start. Funny, but not a comedy. Honouring the inspirations but not beholden to them. There are so many parts that are already in place; Agent Coulson and SHIELD, Paul Bettany as JARVIS - a throwaway part that could have been played by anybody really - that developed into the Vision Role and Leslie Bibb, who would replay Christine Everhart several times across various aspects of the saga. Even stuff that was clearly a retrofitted, such as Peter Billingsley playing Riva - who would then appear in ""Far from Home"", 11 years later and play off his scene here. Most key though, is the post credits scene, both the concept of them - and the ""I'm putting together a team"" line.What's less consistent ... well, they would recast Rhodey, obviously and Howard Stark as he became a more important character in subsequent films. It's a lot less in terms of consequences, than most films would be about in the future - admittedly, there's keeping a weapon away from a bad guy, which thinking about it does become a staple plot for the MCU - but it's not about saving the world or even America this time. As I said above too, occasionally the CGI is showing it's age a little - with regards interactions between RDJ's fact and the Ironman helmet specifically.Looking back now, is it one of my favourite MCU films? No, not really - but that speaks more to the quality of others than to any failure on behalf of what is a fun, funny and fantastic film.","7/10"
"Iron Man","bowmanblue","5 July 2014","'Iron Man' is the surprise superhero hit from Marvel Studios which charts the tale of billionaire weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark, to the flying metal superhero 'Iron Man.' It seemed that, despite its impressive budget, no one quite imagined this lesser (when compared with the more famous – and bankable – superheroes such as Spiderman, Batman and Superman) hero to become quite as bigger box office draw as it turned out. And it definitely isn't 'wall-to-wall action' which drew the crowds in.To be honest, there isn't an awful lot of 'Iron Man' in Iron Man the movie. Our hero, Tony Stark (expertly played by Robert Downey Jr) only gets inside his costume about three times in a two hour movie. Therefore, don't expect a load of 'Michael Bay-style' explosions every few minutes.You have to get the 'origins' side of Iron Man out of the way here, showing how he transgresses from playboy billionaire to concerned citizen, prepared to put his life on the limb to save the world. So a lot of the story is taken up with HOW he becomes the titular character.However, don't let any lack of action fool you into thinking this isn't going to be one hell of a ride. Somehow, everything just works and the two hours fly by faster than Iron Man outrunning some jet fighters.You don't have to love comic books or superheroes to appreciate that this is a really fun film. It's nowhere near as dark as Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and sticks to its upbeat and colourful comic book roots. It's a great popcorn film for all the family and even having Gwyneth Paltrow in it doesn't detract from the fun element *miaow! http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","7/10"

I also think that the two others which followed has lost this kind of magic that had the first one.Robert Downey Jr. made on of his best interpretations in this movie played as Iron Man and Tony Stark. I think the selection of him was the point of culmination together with the visual effects of the movie and the plot.

"Iron Man","lesleyharris30","5 July 2012","Iron Man is a brilliant with a very well written plot and an outstanding cast. Tony Stark is just a terrific superhero and I could not imagine anyone doing any better as the womanizing billionaire than Robert Downey Jr. He is able to be both dramatic at times and humorous, it's a great example of perfect casting. Tte only thing I felt was lacking in the film was the twists, which were all, admittedly, very predictable, there was not anything that surprised or shocked me. It is an action packed, thrilling adventure, it had me at the edge of my seat many times as we genuinely care for these characters. Iron Man is a great movie that I would recommend to all Marvel fans.Billionaire Tony Stark's life changes after he is kidnapped by terrorists and builds a robot which he uses to escape, the machine is able to fly and shoot bullets.He builds a better version which he then decides to use to fight evil and calls himself Iron Man.Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr.","7/10"
"Iron Man","Chris_Docker","30 April 2008","Since Marvel Comics and CGI started their mystical marriage in the late 1990s, we've had superheroes galore. Hulks, Surfers, Spidermen, not to mention constantly renewed Batmans and Supermans. So what does Iron Man have to offer that's different? A flawed character that becomes honourable is the answer, triumphing in the battle of Good over Evil in spite of being a bit of a prat.Add to that some of the best features of Robocop, Batman Begins and Terminator II, and you have one of the more satisfying comic-books-turned-blockbuster that we've seen for a while.Billionaire and genius Tony Stark  with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes  is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. Forced to work for them, he has other plans. Stark, nicely played by Robert Downey Jr, fashions a hi-tech suit of armour - before going on to save the world in usual exemplary fashion.This long build-up  to explain how he becomes Iron Man  is arguably the best part of the film. Ingenious special effects give Stark's futuristic Malibu mansion a sci-fi rather than fantasy feel. And the subtle build-up makes us more forgiving as the story slips slowly into comic-book reality.There are, of course, compromises. It has to appeal to kids as well as adults, so there is none of the gutsiness of Terminator I (or similar adult-orientated sci-fi). And in spite of the heavy moral-political issues at stake, Iron Man stays politically bland  this being the only way to get D.O.D. approval and hence associated goodies like fighter jets and military hardware.One of the most interesting ideas for me in the film was the idea of 'zero accountability'. This takes the form of having all the wealth, brains and playboy attributes that fiction writers can imagine, but could also be a symbol for U.S. military might, for instance. Stark's first premise, of power being the ultimate deterrent (and hence a peace-keeping force) is undermined when the enemy gets hold of the same weapons and starts killing indiscriminately. Theologians might also muse how power itself has no moral authority. Good guys have to grudgingly beseech permission from whoever wields the biggest thunderbolt.Iron Man, essentially a symbol of power, abounds in biblical references, even if these come more from the comic book creators than any learning on the part of filmmakers. Jericho, the name given to Stark's finest military weapon, was the city that had to be destroyed, 'as an outward display of faith.' Which makes for great symbolism. Until you consider that modern-day Jericho is in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, and then Stark's 'rockets' start to look a lot more loaded.Iron Man's technology has a special feature to avoid targeting civilians. Now this is one military development I would love to see.The second half of the movie is pure action, but with a well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged. Out-of-reach love-interest materialises as Gwyneth Paltrow, who I found very agreeable to watch, and the excellent supporting cast also includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. This is a film that tries to please everyone and largely succeeds. It's a two-hour thrill-ride that offers a new action-hero for our CGI-sated palates.On a personal note, my big disappointment was the title track  or rather lack of it. Having heard one of the most famous heavy metal riffs of all time in the trailer, I couldn't wait to see Iron Man flying through the skies to the sound of Black Sabbath's rock anthem. Sadly, the riff is all you get (probably cos the words seem to be based on an altogether different story). But if you sit through the closing credits hoping for more, you do at least get a very important extra scene. So you've been warned: don't leave the cinema beforehand!","9/10"
"Iron Man","tomgillespie2002","11 May 2013","It seems strange to think that this was considered a big gamble back in 2008, when Marvel Studios finally began putting into place the ensemble of superhero films that would lead to the fantastically entertaining The Avengers. They hired a relatively rookie director in Jon Favreau who, up to this point, had made the shoddy Made (2001), Will Ferrell vehicle Elf (2003) and kiddie-flick Zathura (2005), and cast Robert Downey Jr., an actor that was still trying to piece together his career after years of drug and alcohol abuse. After all, Iron Man is basically a story about a rich genius who fights crime in a flying metal suit, and had it not being given the necessary thought and care, this could have been a disaster. Thankfully, it's anything but, thanks to Downey Jr.'s infectious performance, a razor-sharp screenplay by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, and Favreau's confident direction.Weapons manufacturer and playboy Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) travels to Afghanistan with his good friend Lt. Colonel Rhodes (Terrence Howard) to show off his new weapon of mass destruction, the Jericho. He is ambushed and taken hostage by a terrorist group that call themselves the Ten Rings, who seriously wound Stark, causing shrapnel to lodge dangerously close to his heart. An electromagnet is developed by fellow captive Yinsen (Shaun Toub) to keep the shrapnel away from his heart, and the two are forced to build the Jericho from parts of Stark's stolen weapons. He instead builds a prototype metal suit, which he uses to all but destroy the terrorist group and escape back to America. After calling a press conference where he announces that Stark Industries will cease war profiteering, Stark builds his Iron Man suit with the help of his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Seeing stocks falling and the potential collapse of the company, Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) wants the technology for himself.The main problem that faces most superhero origin films is having to combine the protagonist's development into the hero of the title with a villain capable of giving the hero a genuine threat to face, as well as blending them together to form one cohesive storyline. Marvel in particular have had trouble with their super-villains, with only Thor's multi-dimensional Loki, played with a thespian quality by Tom Hiddleston, proving successful. Iron Man suffers here too, only it seems almost irrelevant. Obadiah Stane does eventually don a gigantic metal suit for a big showdown at the climax, but Stane's menace comes from his corporate greed, offering only slight hints at what goes on in the big, bald dome of his, while coming across as a trusted friend to Stark.It is Stark's personal development that takes centre stage, and it's a true joy to watch it. At first, he is cocky, smarmy, and filthy-rich, and after he gets a wake-up call, he is still cocky, smarmy and filthy- rich. Only now he understands the devastation his weapons program is inflicting of thousands of innocents, who up until now, Stark has casually viewed through the safety of his television. In the wrong hands, Stark could have been a disaster, apparently caring little for the ramifications of his actions, buying priceless works of art he'll never see just because he can. Downey Jr. injects the same energy he's been putting into his characters throughout his entire career - fast- talking and wise-cracking, almost comically narcissistic. But Downey Jr. is best at giving his characters an underlying sense of damage beneath the cocky exterior, perhaps a reflection on his long-standing problems in real-life, and this helps give Stark an undeniable depth, and therefore making him effortlessly fascinating to watch.Iron Man is most entertaining when showing Stark at work - bashing various parts together, interacting with his robots and his house computer Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany), and testing his newly acquired powers. His first flying trial has him hovering uncomfortably and struggling for complete control, destroying his hoard of expensive super cars in the process. It's a funny, exciting scene, rounded off with ""yeah, I can fly"". It's rare for a superhero film to be so successful in portraying the development of its character, whether having to experience a mutation, an experiment gone wrong, or facing childhood fears, this proves that simply building a metal super-suit is far more entertaining. This is still Marvel's best pre-Avengers effort, including it's vastly inferior sequel, and Tony Stark was the best to watch amongst the massive ensemble when the giant ego's finally came together. But that's all down to the care given to this film, which is quite simply a massive hoot.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","10/10"
"Iron Man","Vartiainen","17 August 2013","This stands in my personal ratings as one of the best superhero movies of all time, if not as one of the best movies of all time. It's that good.What makes the movie stand out from its brethren is, first of all, the sheer quality. Everything in this film feels just right. The character of Tony Stark is dead on. I believe that even the most hardcore Marvel nerd would agree that Robert Downey Jr. was perfectly cast for this role. He epitomizes the character beautifully, from the raw charisma to the brilliance of mind to the witty comebacks to the vulnerability of alcoholism. The movie would work just because of him (which the sequels will show), but luckily we get even more for our money. We get special effects that defied all of our expectations, we get a fetching origins story, we get Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Cane (one of his best recent roles) and Gwyneth Paltrow as the perfect Pepper Potts. This is very heavily a character film, which I don't mind at all when the characters are as good as this. Sure there are great action scenes and it's a nice film visually, but it works and it's so good because the characters work off each other so well. You can feel the underlying tension whenever those three share screen time.I could nitpick here and state that perhaps the whole film felt a bit rushed because they had to cram to much material into a single film, or that the final battle could have been slightly better (mostly because of the villainous gloating cliché), but all these minor complaints pale in comparison to the film as a whole. I love this film. It's a brilliant character study, an even more brilliant action film and one of the best superhero movies yet made. See it, love it.","9/10"
"Iron Man","Michael_Elliott","23 December 2008","Iron Man (2008) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is forced to build an armored suit in order to escape from a group of terrorists but after reaching safety he decides to use technology to help people. I never was a comic book movie guy but my opinion on them has changed over the past couple years since directors and screenwriters decided to throw some brains into the film. Here's another fine example of a film that has something to say and doesn't just resort to non-stop action and slapstick violence. The movie is extremely well made, wonderfully acted and contains some great special effects and that makes it one of the better films of its type. I think the key to this film working is the performance by Downey, Jr. who makes you feel as if everything you're watching could really happen. I think a lot of times you really have to suspend your disbelief but that's not the case here because Downey is so great that you feel he really knows how to create this suit and make it work. I loved the early scenes before the terrorist attack when Downey uses his comic skills because this shows what a changed man he is after he is able to escape. The supporting cast is also very good with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges doing fine work, although I felt both of their characters could have been written better. Gwyneth Paltrow is the one who really shocked me because I had seen many of her artsy films and was shocked at how well she could handle this material. The chemistry between her and Downey is great and adds a lot of suspense to the film especially in the final minutes. Favreau does a wonderful job with his directing duties and manages to keep the story movie and to keep the viewer entertained even though the final Iron Man doesn't show up until a hour into the film. I'm not a fan of CGI because I feel most directors don't know how to use it but that's not the case here because the effects fit in well with the story and they never try to be the main focus of the film.","10/10"

"Iron Man","caseynicholson","8 January 2015","This film is not the first movie to feature characters from Marvel Comics. The 2000's saw the ""X-Men"" franchise, a ""Hulk"" movie, two ""Fantastic Four"" movies, and the Toby Maguire ""Spider-Man"" trilogy. However, all of those movies were films that Marvel outsourced to various companies--notably Fox and Sony. ""Iron Man"" is the first film to be made in house by Marvel Studios, and as such it's the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, i.e. the first film that will come to interact with characters from other films that are not direct sequels. For this reason, ""Iron Man"" is worth watching if you happen to be a fan of any of the other MCU movies, especially ""The Avengers"" series. ""Iron Man"" begins the process of building continuity across different Marvel films, and for the true nerds amongst us there are many tidbits of information in this movie that are beneficial to understanding the rest of the MCU films. Still, the main reason to watch this movie is not its place in the MCU, but its value as a standalone film. Marvel Studios set out to prove themselves with this movie, and they delivered a hit. The film is a solid two hours of thrills that features a robust and engaging storyline and fantastic acting. Robert Downey, Jr. defines the role of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges all turn out dynamic performances. Bridges especially shines as Obadiah Stain, and contributes much to the movie. That said, I give this film nine out of ten stars. It's one of the best in the comics movie genre, and I only stop myself from giving it a ten because I try to reserve that score for movies I see as not only great, but perfect. ""Iron Man"" comes mighty close to that, and I'm sure you'll agree that it deserves high marks. Oh, and don't forget to watch the post-credits scene, which foreshadows the rest of the MCU!","9/10"
"Iron Man","SubZeroMK","31 May 2009","I was hyped for the movie when it was on the internet as news. I wasn't the biggest fan of Iron-Man at the time, but I always liked Robert Downey Jr., because he's a phenomenal actor. Not only that, but having Jon Favreau on board made me want to watch this film even more. He's a great comedic actor, and would seem like a cool buddy to hang out with.So I went in there with high expectations and I came out very satisfied at what I just had seen. I couldn't think of anyone else who could play Iron-Man better than Robert Downey. Thanks to this film, I put Iron-Man at the second spot in my favorite super-hero list. Blade comes first.Of course I bought the blu-ray version of the movie, watched all the special features and it was great. The action was great, it was planned out where it was needed. Jeff Bridges also did a great job on his character, acting as a mentor and then as Iron-Man's enemy. He didn't like to put up with the selfish rich guy, I get it, no one likes that.Overall, a 10/10 for creativity. Now, I'm anxious for the sequel, and you know what they say about sequels, they're always the best ones in the series.","8/10"
"Iron Man","IPyaarCinema","3 February 2021","Review By Kamal KIron Man, one of the most important movies of its kind. When it first came out in 2008, I don't think anybody expected it to be as big a hit as it was. A B-list superhero played by a washed-up actor being produced by a barebones studio? Are you nuts? And then we were all surprised to see how great it was.It's thanks in large part to Robert Downey Jr. He really is Iron Man. He manages to give that real sense of a ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."" It's hard to imagine anybody else playing Tony Stark this far along in the franchise's lifespan.This movie was most people's entry point into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Having only recently re-watched it, I still can't believe how small it was at this point. Nowadays we see aliens, talking raccoons, and sentient trees, but Iron Man has a realism to it that keeps it grounded while still being comic-booky.Twelve years after its release, the special effects still manage to hold up. The Iron Man suit's CGI still looks as real as possible, and it would still be in the same elite company as movies like Thor: Ragnarok or Ant-Man.Again, this is a movie that really shouldn't have worked so well, but I'll be damned if Jon Favreau and Kevin Feige didn't pull it off. It's a movie that I'll return to for years to come, if for no reason other than to marvel (heh) at how much Tony Stark has grown up since. Can't wait for new fans to experience this movie as well as the rest of the MCU.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Quinoa1984","2 May 2008","Iron Man is about as close to perfect popcorn entertainment as we can expect in this beginning of the summer season. But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark's as a character not exactly the usual 'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada' thing. He has a more jaded attitude, slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait, sorry, iron, or alloy as it is). I'm almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters, only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money, lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire, and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don't identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And, when the time comes, he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time, when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, he does have a level of conscience from the start, realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there, though it's pretty much that), and wants to not want this any longer. Instead, basically, he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan, he'll come and wipe em out in a jiffy. In this sense it's pure escapism, but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True, it might be much to imagine, but in the realm of a comic book movie, where we're already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he's that damn good.It's a thrill-ride, and it's very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in, for example, Ghost Rider. It's genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane, yeah you read that right), or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake, this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast. You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man, but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can't do it with a George Clooney, but with Downey Jr. it's a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He's able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero, but also hint at the fact that he's playing this character for what he is, and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him, it wouldn't work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it's due, also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is, basically, the ""anti-dude"" as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark's technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow, where'd she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well, and a couple of other supporting parts, they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director, who should get credit where it's certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer, going up through Made, Elf, and the recent bomb Zathura, it's a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go, he doesn't tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick, efficient film-making, and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched 'test' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here, Favreau's is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line, and how its delivered and in the context, is worth the price of admission.Oh, and by the way, stay through the end credits. If you're geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches), you'll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.","9/10"
"Iron Man","ametaphysicalshark","5 May 2008","Unlike pretty much all the superhero movies out there other than the Hellboy movies, I found ""Iron Man"" improved on second viewing. I'd go as far as saying that it's the best superhero film to date, although I'd have to see ""Hellboy II"" again before being sure about it. This film is near perfect as a summer entertainment. Light and largely insubstantial, but still not dumb in the slightest, and actually featuring some interesting writing for Tony Stark. The standard-issue moral dilemmas are handled well, without the stifling seriousness and heavy-handedness which sometimes let down the Nolan Batman films. We care about the dilemmas not necessarily due to their nature but because Tony Stark is such a convincing character.I'm going to be drawing comparisons to ""The Dark Knight"" throughout this 'review'. I do so not because I dislike ""The Dark Knight"" (in fact until a few hours ago I thought I liked it a tad more than ""Iron Man""), but because I'm attempting to make a case for ""Iron Man"" as the best summer blockbuster released in 2008, and the best superhero film to date. ""The Dark Knight"" is often praised for being more adult and darker than any other superhero film to date. First off, 'more adult' and 'darker' aren't necessarily the same thing. ""The Dark Knight"" is, on paper, really not all that more ludicrous than ""Iron Man"", nor is it a better story, nor are the characters more interesting. Bruce Wayne barely exists in ""The Dark Knight"", Rachel Dawes isn't up to much, Harvey Dent's transformation isn't all that convincing.Beyond just that, the film is stiflingly dark and humorless, almost to a fault because, well, it is about a guy walking around in a batsuit and fighting a maniac in clown makeup and a guy with half a face. The dialogue is often of an obviously expository nature. Where ""The Dark Knight"" is better than ""Iron Man"" is in the visual style. It also boasts a better villain. On the other hand, ""Iron Man"" is a straightforward superhero movie. It's odd, after so many superhero films, to finally see one which really feels like reading a superhero comic. I am not a fan of Iron Man or Marvel in general, but have read some good Iron Man comics in the past, and this film so wonderfully captures the nature of a superhero comic. Sure, Jeff Bridges' villain isn't great, but he fits very nicely into the story of the movie. The story's really very good too. The real heart of the film though is with Iron Man himself. While I give a lot of credit to Robert Downey Jr., who gives a performance which, like Heath Ledger's in ""The Dark Knight"", is well beyond the standard for popcorn fare. The complaints about the film having no character development are also pretty unwarranted. Granted, Pepper Potts isn't up to much, but what really matters is Tony Stark himself and I found him not only convincingly portrayed but quite excellently-written as well. The film is concerned with the origins of Iron Man, not with the origins of Tony Stark. We hear about his father, we see what he was like before being in captivity, but the film doesn't bother with the usual clichéd approach which basically usually means the character is defined by two, maybe three if you're lucky, big, clichéd events in his life. All we need to know for this specific film (there's more to come from Iron Man, let's not forget) is who Tony Stark is NOW, and what went through his head after being in captivity and building the suit. With that in mind I felt ""Iron Man"" provided a well-rounded lead character, much more interesting than Bruce Wayne in ""The Dark Knight"" and more substantial than Hellboy or Peter Parker or pretty much most of the rest with specific regard to the movie incarnations of the characters.The screenplay's wise approach to the origin story means it can focus on the story. It's all pretty standard-issue stuff but done well, and while not insightful or deep or anything it certainly isn't a totally lunkheaded approach to the subject matter: the impact of weapons technology and advancements in the field on the world. Also what really matters is that it's a tight, lean screenplay, and while the climactic battle is a little underwhelming (and unfortunately starts feeling a bit like ""Transformers""), it is at least very well-shot, with a sort of clarity which helps all the action scenes here shine. The film is a well-made, tightly-constructed movie which is as long as it should be, and one which strikes a solid balance between character and story. Robert Downey Jr. is a big part of the film's success, no doubt, but credit should go to director Jon Favreau and the writers as well, because they really managed to deliver a movie that's a hell of a lot of fun, and one with easily the best central character in any superhero movie to date, and I say this as someone who definitely doesn't count Iron Man as their favorite superhero as far as comics go.","10/10"
"Iron Man","z-mbe","16 April 2008","As an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, I was excited but also very scared that this movie would flop.While Robert Downey is not the biggest name in Hollywood, he plays the part perfectly and I was greatly impressed by how he portrayed Iron Man so well.The humor works well for this film also. It's well-written and has a great cast.What impressed me the most was the CGI! They're breath-taking, but aren't distracting enough to let you miss the finer points of this movie.In conclusion, while not perfect, Iron Man lives up to its hype and my expectations as a reader of the comic.","9/10"
"Iron Man","mstomaso","4 May 2008","Tony Stark - playboy, technological genius, and CEO of the world's largest defense contractor - is about to have a major change of heart. Inexperienced in the reality of war and arms trading, Stark is about to become a prisoner of of a terror cell in Afghanistan. The experience will change everything for him. To escape, he must exceed his greatest technological achievements, and in so doing, he envisions a new way to live for him and his firm.Iron Man is, far and away, the best film adaptation of a comic book 'origin story' that I have seen adapted to film. Marvel is certainly on a roll at the movies, but the real genius here is not just in the original material. The casting, script and directing make Iron Man a thorough-going success. The film has the pace of a military thriller (though it is more of an action film), the visual appeal of a well-crafted sci-fi spectacular (though it never sacrifices story to spectacle), and an abundance of talent (although star power does not drive this film).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges (Obie Stane) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper) own the screen, and are nicely supported by Terence Howard and a number of talented character actors. Downey is a perfect Tony Stark - flippant, too-smart-for-his-own-good, utterly dedicated and - at times - hilarious. While the film is far from a one-man-show, Downey's performance could have made this a great comics film even without the fine work by the rest of the cast.I was also pleased by the appearance of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the film, and hope that their appearance is a foreshadow of things to come, not just a cameo.Highly recommended for fans of the genre.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Buddy-51","19 January 2009","Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age). A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion. He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a ""merchant of death,"" but he balks at being called ""the Da Vinci of our time""). Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity. Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and vanquishing the wrongdoers.""Iron Man"" soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards. But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time. He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made ""Iron Man"" what it is without him. Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory. These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen. James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in ""Iron Man"" - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie. It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film. And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be. It's nice to see that somebody finally got things right.","9/10"
"Iron Man","utgard14","30 May 2014","Outstanding movie and possibly the best Marvel's done to date, at least as far as their shared universe films go. Let's cut right to the chase: Robert Downey, Jr. makes this movie work. I'm not going to say he's the perfect Tony Stark because Downey's Stark is really very different from how he has always been in the comics. But it works far better this way and is a huge point in favor of deviating from the source material, which is the eternal struggle between Hollywood and anything it adapts. This is one case where the changes they made worked out great. The rest of the cast is terrific, all following Downey's lead very well. His enthusiastic performance is a joy to watch. I'm sure it must have been a ball for Paltrow, Bridges, and the rest to act with him as they all seem to be having a great time in their scenes together. Jon Favreau does a praiseworthy job of directing, especially when he hadn't really done this type of movie before. The action and special effects are great. The script is smart and funny, though a lot of the humor comes from the ad-libbing of Downey and co-stars, so I'm not sure how much credit I can give the script for that. It's really a wonderful piece of entertainment without being mindless or crude. One of the best superhero films ever made.","9/10"
"Iron Man","CinemaClown","23 March 2015","Marking the commencement of Marvel Cinematic Universe, catapulting Robert Downey Jr. into the league of Hollywood's biggest stars & also announcing the arrival of Marvel Studios into motion picture filmmaking for it is their first fully-financed project, Iron Man not only succeeds as a quality blend of style & substance but is also amongst the best origin stories cinema has come up with for a comic book superhero.Iron Man tells the story of genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark who, while on his tour to war-torn Afghanistan for the demonstration of his new weaponry to United States military, is ambushed & taken hostage by a terrorist group. Working with another captive, he designs an exoskeleton to get out from there & after returning to US further refines his design. The plot covers the change his captivity brings in his entire personality.Stylishly directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man aims for the same grounded approach Nolan applied in Batman Begins & succeeds amazingly well for the most part. The screenplay is brimming with energy, wit & charm, and is brilliantly written & narrated. Production design provides it a very modern feel, Camera-work is vibrantly carried out, Editing briskly paces the whole story which also benefits from Ramin Djawadi's fitting score as well as clever use of existing songs.Coming to the acting department, Iron Man features a star-studded cast in Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges & Terrence Howard but the film belongs to Downey Jr. who blazes brightly in red n gold with a performance that's absolutely fantastic, effortlessly charismatic & downright polished. Overshadowing the input of the rest & fitting the suit perfectly, this is one role that couldn't have gone to a better actor & how this gifted talent renders Tony Stark on screen is a further proof of that.On an overall scale, Iron Man has enough power in it to please both fans of the comics as well as newcomers. Sure its third act isn't as impressive as the first two but the positives eclipse the negatives by a huge margin. Balancing its storytelling aspects with big budget extravaganza to triumph as a work of quality in the eyes of viewers n critics alike, Iron Man is a highly refreshing, wildly entertaining & largely satisfying crowd-pleaser that's hugely responsible for the foundation on which Marvel Studios stands today. Highly recommended.","10/10"
"Iron Man","damianphelps","7 January 2021","When you look back at the influence of Marvel on cinema over the years you have to recognise it as significant. They have changed the types of movies that have been made for 20 years (and it doesn't look like ending soon).This success of Marvel started with Blade, X-Men and Spider-Man however it was Iron Man that really launched the juggernaut that has become Marvel.This is one hell of a movie. Yes it lacks the real gut-wrenching depth of the Dark Knight Trilogy, but it wasn't really aiming for that.This is incredible action, humour met with a good story and the most excellent decision to cast Downey in the titular role.Hit the lights, pump up the volume, popcorn at the ready....GO GO GO","8/10"
"Iron Man","ivo-cobra8","21 October 2015","Iron Man (2008) is American Marvel Superhero Action film and the best one in the trilogy. It is my favorite best superhero film that I love to death!!! The film has awesome Action sequences, it is Entertaining with full suspense, it is intense and it is fast paced. The film is not boring or lame it is brilliant and awesome. You have to put brain in this film. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man did a wonderful job portraying a comic book superhero. I love the Action sequence, the Drama, the genius and brilliance of Tony how he was so brilliant as to build those missiles for Military but get's caught by the terrorists and he is hold as hostage in the caves of Afghanistan, against his will he has to build more missiles for the terrorist, but he builds for himself a suit and he escapes from the caves, he returns home. Tony shut's down the factory and than he starts building an red yellow armor suit and he turns him self in to a vigilante to an red yellow armored suit ultimate superhero ""Iron Man"". He goes back in to Afghanistan and destroys all his weapons and he defends the weakest people. He also has a blue heart in the chest because the shrapnel hits him. He finds out he was betrayed by his dad's partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who turns him self into Iron Monger on the end there is an ultimate showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane did a wonderful job portraying a super villain in this film. Gwyneth Paltrow did a beautiful terrific performance as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant and his love interest. I love this film and is one of my favorite Marvel Superhero action films. Everything in this comic book film is in here. The CGI Iron Man are believable and terrific I have ever seen. They aren't bad, they are good. Jon Favreau did a wonderful and amazing job as directing this film and playing Tony's bodyguard as Harold 'Happy' Hogan the same time, that was amazing!! This film is brilliant I love how it shows Tony's tests scenes when he is building the armor suit, I love how Shows that Tony isn't self selfish centered jerk, he is a good heart person and he wants to do the right thing. To defend an innocent people from his weapons that he build and that his weapons got in to the wrong hands. It is an awesome how he redeem himself and how he had a conscious what was he done when he was building those weapons and how many people had to die. The original film is very good :) One hell of a film. The chemistry between Tony and Pepper is great, this film has a heart. The acting was great and the story was really good! This was definitely one of the best origin stories out there and the ending was fantastic! The fight scenes between Iron Man and Iron Monger was weary intense and awesome kick ass battle between those two super villains and heroes. I went into this film with an open mind and what we got, we got an fantastic comic book film. Paramount pictures sends a strong message to film comic book fans. So Iron Man is one of those movies. Jon Favreau did an amazing job of bring Iron Man to life. He so took the comic and make it look like we just watch this first time. The writing work so well with the actors with their roles. There's a lot of development into the writing and made relate to the comics. But of course the main that people loved this film is Robert Downey Jr. He killed it as Tony Stark and Iron Man. I couldn't see any other actor to take the role. He brings so much development and emotions into Tony and make you relate to him real easy. The rest of the actors did very well, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Palltrow all did an amazing job with their roles.After surviving an unexpected attack in enemy territory, jet-setting industrialist Tony Stark builds a high-tech suit of armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man. Straight from the pages of the legendary comic book, Iron Man is a hero who is built - not born - to be unlike any other.Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.1 It is the first installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"Iron Man","dunmore_ego","18 May 2008","*Iron Man* is a steel-belted planet-crusher of a film; alloy feet on the ground, red-and-gold armor streaking for sub-orbital skies. Based in a reality close to current, like the shrapnel lodged in Tony Stark's chest, we feel it close to our heart technology, physics, corporate backbiting, intimate asides and a self-made hero that speaks in tongues to our wild fantasies of power.Not just for 14-year-old boys.Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, all-American, arrogant, insouciant, egomaniacal billionaire playboy weaponry wizard, who sustains a shrapnel wound in Afghanistan (comic book lore tells us a land mine in Nam; movie places Stark in a *current* non-essential conflict), imprisoned by generic Arabs and forced to make a WMD for them, instead designing an armor suit, first for escape from his oily-complected captors, and then as avenger (wink wink) *against* his own weapon creations and the corporate back door deals that cede those American weapons into oily-complected hands.Departing considerably from comic book canon, all the familiar characters are here, but tweaked: Jim Rhodes (excellent Terence Howard) is not just Stark's pilot, but a high-ranking air force officer; Pepper Potts (moderately cute Gwyneth Paltrow) is Stark's yearning Girl Friday, who sees the parade of fluff through Tony's bedroom as a prelude to her ultimate spanking; Obadiah Stane (an uncharacteristically sinister Jeff Bridges) is not a corporate competitor but in Stark's trusted inner circle, making his betrayal all the more treacherous Directed by Jon Favreau (Vince Vaughn's wife) and screen played surprisingly well by its four writers, *Iron Man* takes its time focusing on the man inside the metal, rather than the mayhem the metal man musters. (Can I have a prize for that one?) In captivity, a fellow prisoner, Yinsen (Shaun Toub) creates an electromagnet to keep the shrapnel from entering Stark's heart, which Stark refines into a glowing ""reactor"" or something, forever to remain his albatross - and simultaneously a cool superhero chest-piece.Yinsen turns Stark from unrepentant war dog to humanitarian avenger by telling him of his ""life's work in the hands of these murderers."" Let's get the ""murderer"" definition straight: when Stark shows off his death-dealing toys in callous arrogance (""Respected or feared? I say, Why not both?""), he merely echoes the stance of the Amerikan Military War Machine, who also believe the ""best weapon is the one you only need to fire once."" Who are the murderers again? Secondly, a business genius like Stark should know how the supposed ""enemy"" market is the house of sand the Amerikan military economy is built upon. When it comes to killing for profit, Amerikan ethics are quite, quite plastic. The first taste of the crude, silver armor is magnificent. Though the '63 comic book version now looks like a clown suit next to his red-and-gold juggernauts, the movie gussies up the suit with mechanical ganglions to lend it cave-cred. And in this roughshod mechanical man, Stark escapes the Arabs like a runaway tank.Back in ""civilization"" Stark turns his focus from corporate warfare to one project  his new armor. Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges scares us with his shaved head.Seeing Stark create and test the powers of his technological marvel is half the fun of this origin tale - and when the full armor suit is eventually revealed, it is the sexiest beast this side of Optimus Prime! CGI is used as sensibly as Ridley Scott used it in *Gladiator*  to enhance the story rather than to blow our minds with cheap shots. Seeing Iron Man out-fly combat jets and take on tanks is action enough AND - the worst part about Doctor Doom in *Fantastic Four* was his voice remaining the fruity scientist's drawl even when he donned the mask  but when Stark slams on his iron man  yeeees! - he has a Vader thoom! We have CGI to thank that Favreau didn't put Downey in a rubber suit and dub in clanking foley. And with the armor's complexity, it is only logical a machine should suit him up - and only CGI could render that machine, rather than having to see him pull on his gleaming jeans one pants-leg at a time.The CGI only falls overboard once, when Stane dons giant armor to battle Iron Man in the final scenes, the movie suddenly turning into *Transformers 2: Electric Boogaloo* for a bad second. In the final cut, no one will notice the ethics paradox  it's not for this movie's target demo to tangle with. *Iron Man* is still one of the great superhero movies.IRON MAN opens with AC/DC's *Back in Black.* And we're played out by Sabbath's *Iron Man*! Not just for 14-year-old boys. But it'll sure make you feel like one.","7/10"
"Iron Man","VithDos","17 April 2008","So the world premier of Iron man to regular movie going audiences happened to be here in Seoul Korea on an army installation. I got to check it out and I was delightfully surprised.Much against the hype, I thought this movie would have been torrid trash acting mingled with cheesy fight scenes. I mean Robert Downey Jr as an action superhero? But I am glad to admit that I misjudged the movie completely. Downey played a very good Tony Stark, in generally every way. From his jokes to his obnoxious lifestyle he looked and walked the part very well. His banter with his right hand assistant Ms. Pepper Potts isn't mind numbing and actually found myself laughing aloud at some of the wit.The movie itself moved at a very good pace. Mixing action, comedy and some drama to just about the right proportions. As with most superhero movies, its rather predictable, but in all the right ways you'd want a superhero movie to be. The animation used was almost seamless, and of course the Iron Man costume was kicking major ass.My only gripe with the movie was the fact that several characters were thrown into the mix with little behind them other than 2D character attributes. Leslie Bibb's character, Christine Everhart, is pretty useless other than the two or three lines she has. Hardly worth a hardbody like Leslie Bibb to play. Several other characters didn't feel fleshed out at all. Raza (Faran Tahir), Obediah Stone (Jeff Bridges) , and even Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) feel hollow in the fact that they have little justification for many of their actions.So All in all, I'd give this movie an 8.3. Fun for the whole family, great pacing, and a Superhero movie to give the next Batman movie a run for its money.","9/10"
"Iron Man","r96sk","13 January 2021","My first taste of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A great start!I absolutely enjoyed seeing 'Iron Man'. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as the titular character, who is a blast to watch throughout - love the design! The plot is very entertaining, I like how it tells the story; simply, but very effectively. Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow, meanwhile, all add to the film with good performances.The special effects are very neat, as are all the action sequences. I will say the score isn't the strongest, at least in terms of what I'd expect from this sorta film. I wouldn't say it's bad per se, just not as spectacular as it could've (should've?) been; especially with someone like Ramin Djawadi composing. I love a film with great music, so hopefully that improves as I watch the MCU expand.I know, I'm extremely late to this particularly party but happy to finally begin watching.","9/10"
"Iron Man","eric262003","20 April 2009","Of the top, my all time favourite superhero movie is the 1989 Batman, and my second favourite was the 1994 Alec Baldwin superhero movie ""The Shadow"" (the other ones seem to lack a certain formula that doesn't appeal to me very well).Not trying to be picky, but for a superhero film to work, isn't quite necessarily based on the excitement, the colours, the special gift our hero possesses or the colourful villains. It's fundamental priority is centered around the person behind the costume, the humanly characteristics our hero portrays. That in itself lures me into watching superhero action films. The superhero persona is only the frosting on the cake as to what drives the person behind the goals the character wishes to accomplish and the tactics he/she possesses and the dangers they encounter along the way of their quests.""Iron Man"" is an inspiration of how superhero movies should be made. The man behind the robot, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) suit represent raw emotion, real characterizations and a drive behind his motives. In addition to that, he is fun-loving, intelligent with just the right amount of quirkiness that is over-blown serious or overly silly. A great trait about the movie is that it isn't forced or rushed into the action scenes right away. ""Iron Man"" starts with the story behind Tony Stark and gradually it builds up the action. That way, it makes room for more further development as the story progresses. We can easily observe the dilemmas that Tony Stark is faced with and what he plans t do to overcome the obstacles that are upstaging him. Unlike other superhero films with cheesy dialog, in ""Iron Man"" the acting is surprisingly excellent. Downey is born to play this complex character, and succeeds rather well with his usual wit and low-key acting. It is by far the best I've seen since Michael Keaton in ""Batman"" and that was almost 20 years ago. His Tony Stark and the hardships he faces is convincing enough to sympathize with.Gwyneth Paltrow turns in another compelling performance as Tony Stark's loyal aide Pepper Potts. She provides a certain kind of charm and kindness that isn't just the female lead. Her facial expressions of concern and bewilderment speak more volumes than her voice (though her dialog was excellent too). Terrence Howard shines as Col. Rhodes, but I would've liked him to have more air time and better interactions between him and Stark, that might be my only criticism there. Plus Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the villain Obadiah Stane. The special effects are amazingly stunning in a way that it doesn't usurp the dialog like in many superhero moves. It succeeds in it being even balanced and avoids the cheese factor immensely. Last year I went to the theaters expecting to see another cheap-thrilling superhero action blockbuster, boy it was one of those rare moments where I was glad I was wrong. It was everything I ever hoped for in a superhero movie. Especially the development of the man behind the suit rather than the Iron Man himself. Stay tuned next year folks, the long-awaited sequel is coming soon. Get your tickets while they last. Get that camera rolling Jon Favreau.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Mcduff3601","16 February 2021","This in my opinion is the best of the super hero movies. I was never into Ironman comics but this movie made me a fan. It has great pacing and lots of action. The build up of the characters is good, at least enough that you care to see what happens to them.This is a great movie that is worthy of rewatching.

"Iron Man","taylorkingston","26 May 2015","I really love this movie. It's a great beginning to an awesome series of movies. This movie is about Tony Stark. Genius. Billionaire. Playboy. Philanthropist. He is the son of a legendary inventor of weapons, and after his death, Tony continued on with his Father's work. But one day, when demonstrating a new weapon in the Middle East, he his kidnapped. He is forced to build his weapons for terrorists, but what he really does is build a suit that he controls. Then he beats the crap out of everyone, escapes, goes home, and continues to save the world as Iron Man. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.","10/10"
"Iron Man","ccthemovieman-1","10 October 2008","Simply put, this was a very entertaining movie.Despite the movie running a little long for an intense, action movie, overall it was still very interesting and fun to watch because the pacing was so good. Neither the action segments nor the lulls, the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but, frankly, what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a ""kids"" movie made today. Thankfully, that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent ""Transformers"" film I viewed.The scenes with ""Iron Man"" a.k.a. ""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance, catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot, piloted by the corporate bad guy ""Obadiah Stane"" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see, too.Some complain the film is not really all that ""smart"" and it's a bit too predictable, but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters. Speaking of characters, it wasn't easy to recognize Bridges with a bald head and full beard but once I heard his distinctive voice, I knew who it was. Gywneth Paltrow played a sweet role as Stark's loyal secretary, ""Pepper Potts."" (Nice name!!). The Afghanistan villain was credible. Actually, I liked him better than the obnoxious Liberal news reporter, who was annoying.The ""moral"" of the story the screenwriters preach is that military might as a deterrent to fighting terrorists can easily backfire as companies which manufacture arms for the U.S. could also be acquired by bad guys (because of greedy and corrupt U.S. businessmen). This is naive Liberal propaganda, the kind I would expect out of the movie industry, whether in Hollywood or Europe. Sadly, there will never be a shortage of bullies and evil people, who will then crush an unarmed foe as the people in this film attempt to do. It's also implausible any company like the one shown in this movie could so easily travel to a hot spot like Afghanistan and deal with terrorists. It's unrealistic, but that's today's movies for you. Also, despite the nonviolent message in the story, the good guy sure wipes out his share of people with a variety of weapons! For someone preaching peace, he sure didn't hesitate in killing opponents.Iron Man's metal suit is definitely very cool, equipped with about anything you'd need to fight an army of terrorists, or anyone else. The suit - and his super pacemaker - turn him into a Superman-type guy in that he can fly pretty high and pretty high. The latter part - how high he could fly - makes a nice conclusion, by the way, regarding the good guy's battle against the ""bad Iron Man.""","8/10"
"Iron Man","zetes","4 May 2008","A good superhero movie, but I'm more than a little shocked at the insanely good reviews it's gotten. Perhaps I'm just getting sick of the superhero movie formula, at least the initial installments of them. Same old same old, really. The only real positive element of the movie is Robert Downey Jr., who plays himself as he pretty much always does. If you don't like the actor, you'll find the movie torturous. I love him, personally, and was happy enough watching him do his thing with a few big action sequences adding some spice. And you've got to appreciate the casting of Jeff ""the Dude"" Bridges as a super villain (kind of a spoiler, I suppose, but if you don't see that coming you're a bonehead). Favreau finds a way to make Bridges enormous and intimidating in every shot, even while riding a Segway, which is a triumph of some sort. But, really, what does Iron Man provide that no other superhero movie has before? I certainly don't see it. The character is actually pretty boring, as are all the supporting characters. Are we now raving merely because of competency?","9/10"

"Iron Man","FiendishDramaturgy","30 April 2008","I have to ask ... Who better to play a middle-aged, wrung-out, loser than Robert Downey, Jr.? I say that with the utmost fondness, however, as I loved the IronMan comics as a kid, and I've never minded Robert Downey, Jr. as an actor. But in this role, he seems to have found his niche. I hope this run lasts for YEARS and gives Downey the inner Zen he needs to finish out his career with some pride.Going back to the origins, as in ""Batman Begins,"" and a plethora of other comic book-to-movie lines (Check out upcoming X-Men ""Origins"" movies, ""Wolverine,"" and ""Magneto.""), seems to be the best formula for launching a new franchise, or breathing new life into a dead one. It certainly worked for Batman and Spiderman, and I'm sure it will work with audiences this time, even though IronMan is a ""lesser"" character who usually stands in the background vying for his 15 seconds of screen time. I am happy to say that Downey and a respectable budget resolves that condition and elevates this franchise to something more desirable and far more reverent than many other comic book attempts on film.Downey really seems to connect with this character, and Gwyneth Paltrow is so funny as Pepper Potts. Yes, she's sexy, too, but she's FUNNY and so is Downey. I do believe audiences the world over will subscribe to this newly resurrected Marvel superhero in that he is completely human. You get Tony Stark, warts and all, and Downey plays him that way. He comes off so at ease in this part that it seems he was engineered specifically for this role.All in all? It may be a little too risquÃ© (in places) and violent (in others) for the kiddies, but the rest of humanity should LOVE it. It is gritty and holds some thread of reality, which weaves itself throughout, although I must say that the finale is a bit tepid. It left something to be desired in the big finish and felt a tad anticlimactic. Still awesome, though.And the toys ... there are loads of gadgets, toys, and comfortably spun one-liners. This is a story-driven, blockbuster-y , KABOOM flick with very little popcorn-ery to be had, although this IS an effects BLOW OUT of a comic book flick! It features a slick production style, top notch film quality, and a superb screen play. This superhero endeavor seems to be the birth of a new (and great) franchise, and I certainly hope it will not be the last. Indeed, there are hints as to another story line for a possible sequel. Did you notice?It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.","10/10"
"Iron Man","TxMike","29 October 2008","A really, really good comic book action movie. The snappy dialog, good acting, and good directing make all the difference.I've always enjoyed Robert Downey Jr., even in his TV roles, and here he carries the movie as Tony Stark, boy genius and inventor who after his father's death gains control of the biggest corporation making missiles and other machines of war. Tony continues what his father had built, and takes it a few steps further with his own inventions.Another actor I always like is Terrence Howard, and here he is long time friend of Tony's, and a military officer, Rhodey.Tony's right hand man in his company is Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. He had run the company while Tony was still growing up and seems to want to continue his expanded role.Good as Tony's trusty personal assistant is Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. She is not only a loyal employee but also a sort of ""pal"" to Tony, yet it seems that she wishes there were more between them.The story centers on an incident where Tony had travels to a war zone to demonstrate to the US military their newest weapon. But there is a motorcade attack and Tony gets imprisoned, with the demand that he develop the new weapon for them. Instead he invents something new, a rather crude iron man suit that he eventually uses to break free. But the experience changes him, as he sees that even the enemy have weapons that his company makes. His big decision when back home is to quit making weapons and instead concentrate on helping humanity.SPOILERS: When back home Tony works hard to perfect a sleek new Iron Man suit, one that can fly anywhere and even at supersonic speeds, and that has exotic weapon and navigational capabilities. In the process he has Pepper track down through company records how enemies were getting weapons. It turns out to be Obadiah, who is trying to get Tony killed so that he can run the corporation and enrich himself further with illegal weapons sales. The climax comes when Obadiah gets into a larger, more powerful iron man suit, and he and Tony battle. With Pepper's help he overcomes Obadiah, and in a conference reveals that he, Tony, is indeed the Iron Man.","7/10"
"Iron Man","Pumpkin_Man","16 August 2009","Iron Man is an awesome film with great special effects! Everybody did a great job and all the actors were casted perfectly. A billionaire inventor named Tony Stark is held hostage in Afghanistan for months because terrorists want him to build a bomb. Instead, he builds an armor suit so he can escape. He is rescued and and while he is back home, he tries to reinvent the suit. He makes it and tries to figure out how to work it. His sexy beautiful personal assistant, Pepper Potts doesn't really him to do it, because she thinks he might die, but he tells her that he must do it to save lives. I love all of Iron Man's gadgets. Soon, some military people think Iron Man is a threat, so Tony asks his friend Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to stop the planes from trying to kill him. His other friend, Obadiah Stane betrays him and builds his own iron suit. If you love action, and comic book movies, you'll love IRON MAN!!!","5/10"
"Iron Man","oneguyrambling","30 October 2010","I know that it is fairly well documented by now, but apparently Robert Downey Jr wasn't supposed to play Tony Stark / Iron Man, now that I've watched it a couple times I can't imagine anyone else having a crack at it.I'm not a comic book guy, I read comics as a kid, but more Donald Duck vs the Beagle Boys stuff. I never got into The Phantom or Captain America stuff, in fact everything I knew about Iron Man I learned from listening to Ghostface Killah albums, hardly a lengthy study. Tony Stark is yet another creation of Stan Lee, the man responsible for seemingly half of the big budget movies of the last decade, and Stark has a good backstory.Tony Stark was born into money, but it helps that he is a creative genius also. Hardly a shrinking violet or a reclusive inventor, he does what everyone (at least thinks) they would do if in a position to do so. He bangs supermodels, often two or more at a time, drives fast cars and spreads his money around.He is witty, smart, sophisticated, vain and a little flawed, a description that also exactly suits RD Jr, casting him was probably the smartest move that was made, and allowed Iron Man to be strong enough to be mentioned in the same breath as the new Batman movies, although it is in my opinion just a minor notch below both.What Iron Man isn't, is derivative or indulgent, when the credits roll and everyone walks away happy it is a feeling well earned.Tony Stark is the head of Stark Industries, a massive company responsible for creating and manufacturing the best weapons on the planet. You know, ""When it comes to spreading fear, 9 out of 10 terrorists prefer Stark Industries weapons."" The movie gets right into the action, Stark is traveling with a military escort after a weapons demonstration when the convoy comes under fire. Most if not all soldiers are killed, and Stark is sent flying by one of his own weapons.Oh the irony! When he comes to, he has been taken hostage and thanks to a fellow prisoner who happens to be a doctor has a magnet strapped to his chest to prevent shards of shrapnel burrowing into his heart and killing him. The terrorists, realizing who they have in their hands, demand Stark build a superweapon for them using all the tools at their disposal. Instead of doing this Stark builds a metallic suit, the bulky and unwieldy ""Mark 1"".Using the Mark 1 Stark escapes, amazingly the suit takes a huge amount of direct fire, some near misses by rocket launchers, but literally explodes when it crashes into a sand dune on its maiden flight.Regardless, once Stark gets back to captivity he decides to ""go straight"" and tells the press that Stark Industries is out of the weapons game, which shocks the hell out of Obadiah Steyn, the public face of the company when Stark is under the weather or out whoring it up.Stark's right hand man is Pepper Pots, his secretary who handles all the everyday running of his life and tries to make sure that he stays on the straight and narrow where possible. Gwenyth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots, and really doesn't have a great deal to do. He also has a good buddy in the military Col. Roads, a virtual butler named Jarvis and a couple of robotic assistants who are largely along for comic relief.The Mark 1 inspires Stark to hone his design, and he does so successfully after some amusing failed attempts. Once he completes and test drives the suit (which looks and performs in a cool manner), it obviously becomes sought after by various parties, most of them thinking naughty thoughts, and the rest of the film has Tony Stark fighting for truth justice and the American way, (or something similar).Downey Jr is quick witted and rarely shuts up, though he is never boring or annoying, Terrence Howard sorta sleeps through his role as Col. Roads, but as a hardened military man he is supposed to be calm and stoic I guess. Paltrow plays the role that only several thousand random interchangeable Hollywood women could play, and she seems bemused to even be there after a decade of so called ""serious"" stuff.The strangest thing is how old Jeff bridges looks with a bald head and a full beard, I had to remind myself that I was watching ""the Lebowski Dude"" but I must say he has an immaculately shaped head that look great bald, and played the almost Father figure to Tony Start quite well. There are some great setpieces, some snappy dialogue and quite a few more laughs than the Batman flicks, or a season of Two and a Half Men for that matter.The acid test: my wife watched Iron Man with me, all the way through, without once walking off in disgust or needing to ""Oh sure!"" her way through long scenes, which happens in quite a few action or guy movies that she has witnessed. I might take the ultimate challenge later this year and see if my Dad will sit through more than 15 minutes of this without leaving the house.The best part? I actually really look forward to Iron Man 2 & 3, as opposed to say X-Men or Spiderman when you know you'll watch the inevitable sequels but don't expect much.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. This is a very entertaining movie that also works as a serious film. That doesn't happen too often. So as long as Downey Jr is Stark and Favreau is directing, I'm aboard for the ride.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com","1/10"
"Iron Man","Sirus_the_Virus","2 August 2009","Iron Man is a cool, smart, and funny comic book film that is one of the best ever made.I will come out and say this. THe Dark Knight is better. You have to agree with me because The Dark Knight has brains, it's serious, and it's amazing. Iron Man is one of the best films ever, but The Dark Knight is the best film ever. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark, a cocky weapon builder who is held captive. He is forced against his will to make a weapon called The Jerico. Instead he builds a suit which is his one way ticket out of there. So he returns to L.A. and decides to shut down his business. Because he saw tons of people murdered by his weapons. His friends Pepper(Gweneth Paltrow), JIm Rohdes(Terrence Howard)and Obideiah(Jeff Bridges) are all surprised. Tony begins experimenting with his iron suits. He soon fights crime as Iron Man. Iron Man has amazing visual effects. To think it's directed by Jon Faverau. Everyone in Iron Man is great and I think Robert Downey Jr. deserved an Oscar nomination for this and his role in Tropic Thunder. This film boosted his career back up. Robert Downey Jr. is here to stay for a while. Iron Man 2 will be out on May 7, 2010 and I can't wait til it comes out.","9/10"
"Iron Man","DesertDogMedia","20 August 2014","Title: Iron ManCondensed Storyline: A billionaire, playboy, weapons maker called Tony Stark is kidnapped and held captive in the middle east, so he has to escape. He does so with his new battle suit, but there is a traitor close to him Notable Acting: This movie was the movie which secured Robert Downey Jr in Hollywood, after having a troubled life prior to this movie, filled with substance abuse and poor acting roles. But when it came to the 2008 movie Iron Man this made him an overnight success as it was his first blockbuster movie and paved the way for his acting career. He fits the role so perfectly, because he is able to act pretentious and stuck up like his character of Tony Stark is. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the secretary/love interest of Pepper Potts, her character was enjoyable, but felt more like a secondary character compared to that of a primary character. The same could be aid about Jeff Bridges who plays the big bad of Obadiah Stane in this movie. Costume: The costume of Ironman was made with a stunning mixture between CGI and practical effects, and in all honesty, that is the bet way they could have done it. Because if they had done it with all practically effects, it would have looked lacking of sorts. And if it was done with all CGI it possibly would have looked cheesy. So I think they got it as good as could be. Incorrect Science: The arc reactor is used to keep the shrapnel out of Tony's heart, yet Yinsen talks about the arc reactor running his heart, feels like a nudge to the audience there. US soldiers are trained to never stop while ambushed in a convoy. All US army HMMWVs are armoured, the shots shown in the ambush scene go right through the door and window, they wouldn't do that if it was armoured. They would also give such a wealthy man added protection if he was visiting a warzone. Ironman encounters icing on his first flight with the MK2, but with no visible moisture in the air or on Ironman, so the air around him would have to be around -30 to -40 for icing of that magnitude to form. Overall Feel: Before this movie Ironman was in the B-list heroes group, the guy normal people wouldn't know. But the nerds or fans of the Avengers comic would know him. But after this movie, he was thrown right up there with the best. I used to watch the Ironman cartoon in the 90's and I can say that this did it justice, they stayed close to the source material and made some adaptations here and there, but it was a great movie which allows Marvel to get a foot hold for their cinematic universe. Before this they only had Blade in the late 90's and Spiderman in the 2000's. But even Spiderman could have ruined this movie, by ending it's trilogy on a bad note with Spiderman 3.","10/10"
"Iron Man","helmutty","30 April 2008","The movie does live up to my expectation. Iron man is one of the best movie in 2008. It is good to see some rising star such as director Jon Favreau, who directed Elf and Zathura and acted as the sidekick of Matt Murdock in Daredevil, now directs a big marvel movie and I am glad that he manages it well. The acting is good, CGI is good too and there are couples of intense scenes. Not much of a disappointment. Even the few action scenes are managed well so as we would not feel bored or felt that its CGI make up for the few action scenes.The story: Tony stark is rich, a Playboy and a genius. He is having his perfect life until when a group of terrorists captures him and force him to make a powerful weapon they want. Shortly, Tony decides to build an amour to protect him while escaping. He escapes, he decides to upgrade the amour and uses it to protect people. Robert Downey Jr is a good choice to play Tony Stark. While all the others are good too. CGI is amazing, it makes Iron man flexible. It is one of the most intense marvel movie I saw and that is what that makes it good, awesome. There is pretty much humour too even when fighting.Overall: As I says, Iron man is one of the most intense marvel comic movie I ever saw, it is worth watching it in cinema. The CGI and the battle scenes are worth it and it makes up for the few action scenes. The story is intense. It should be the 1st at box office and will. This will leave you craving for more, it feels quite short although it is 2 hours and will want Iron man 2. This will be added to my best movies which includes Transformers. Now CGI is really realistic.","8/10"
"Iron Man","phubbs","18 November 2014","I admit, I was expecting this to be dreadful but I was wrong, its amazingly very good. The usual obvious origins story line of course with everything you tend to expect when a super heroic legend begins. The first thing that hit me was the suit, its sex on a stick for sure! it looks so so damn cool. The way it attaches itself to Downey and locks in place, the HUD display in the helmet, the weapons on the arm sections, its fantastic, finally there's a competitor to the Stormtrooper armour.This is what I wanna see for the next Robocop, but with a more violent tone of course. This movie shows what can be done if done right, how 'Transformers' could have looked, its very impressive indeed. Not only are the actual Iron Man suits extremely well made for real in certain sequences, but the CGI is top notch in other outlandish sequences. I'm no fan of CGI I won't deny but even this shocked me, I fully expected this film to look bad obvious plastic and fake, but bugger me if the CGI wasn't fudging amazing! Best damn CGI I've seen in ages, I loved the new shiny looking suit effects but I loved the battered scratched used CGI effects even more. It could of been so easy to keep everything looking nice sparkly and new, but like Star Wars the used universe works wonders and a beaten up Iron Man suit looks brilliant.The first action scene where Stark gets back at the terrorists that captured him is excellent, really action packed and gets you right into the action and wanting more. You really get behind Stark as he powers the terrorists through walls and takes them out with tiny missiles, superb intro for the suit with an awesome and highly grounded action sequence (wouldn't blame you for thinking any action was gonna be hokey).The finale battle with bridges character is a little silly and kinda loses that realistic feel, really goes into the comicbook realms and almost looks a bit like 'Transformers' at times *shudders!*. Its still handled well and of course looks excellent, much better than Bay's robot film as you can actually make out what's going on. Plus its not too over the top, it just about remains reasonably sensible...well as sensible as a comicbook action flick goes anyway.The cast is also spot on for once, Downey is great as Stark, his humour is dry witty sarcastic and does raise a giggle for the older audience members. Bridges does look powerful and evil as the bald villain, he has that deep thick voice which serves him well, didn't see quite enough of him being evil here. Paltrow was also OK, a little annoying with her screams all the time but I guess that's what heroines do in these type of films.There were a few bits I didn't get on with too well, when he's captured by the terrorists he makes his initial suit very quickly, a little too quickly maybe. At the end he refers to himself as Iron Man but this is never mentioned throughout, it just pops up at the end which is weird. Why does he tell the world he is Iron Man at the end? did he make up the name there and then? and why does he show the injury on his chest with a circular glow? surely that's just asking for trouble. Maybe these are things you know if your a fanboy. I would like to ask for no more bloody Stan Lee cameos, Jesus!...yes you made up the characters, we get it, get of your high horse already.Anyway, yes this was a great fun film for everyone to enjoy. Still very surprised it turned out so well and with such good looking CGI! Would have laid money on this being a childish poor looking mess. For once I am looking forward to a sequel.8/10","10/10"
"Iron Man","GusF","15 September 2015","The first entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this is a very fun and exciting superhero film which served as a great introduction to the title character. Although there are some pacing problems, the script is generally strong and it is well directed by Jon Favreau. I have been planning to watch the MCU films and TV series in full from the beginning for the ages and I finally took the plunge today. The only entry in the franchise that I have previously seen is ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" when it was first released in 2011. First of all, I should say that I have never really been terribly interested in Marvel and my knowledge of its characters comes almost exclusively through adaptations and by osmosis. I say ""almost"" since I think that I have read three Marvel comics in my life. As an indication of my Marvel ignorance, I had never even heard of their version of Thor or the Guardians of the Galaxy before their films were released. As such, I will be reviewing these films on their own merits since that it is all I can do, really.Robert Downey, Jr. gives a wonderful performance as Tony Stark, a playboy genius industrialist whose hugely successful company has made weapons for the US government for decades. He is dismissive of any suggestion that his work is in any way immoral. However, after being severely wounded by one of his own weapons and escaping from the clutches of an Afghani terrorist group called the Ten Rings, he sees things from a different perspective and announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons. Over the course of the film, Tony goes from being a self-obsessed businessman primarily concerned with drinking and gambling to a true hero of the old mould. However, the characterisation is so good that this transition seems entirely realistic, even with all the sci-fi trappings. I think that Tony was always a very good man. He just needed his eyes to be opened to the problems of the world around him and what he could do to fix them. He finally realised that creating weapons of mass destruction was not the way to solve said problems. Downey is never less than entirely convincing as Tony, who manages to keep his composure when others would be in a state of panic and has a sardonic remark for most situations. I love quirky, self-deprecating, conflicted characters and he is a great example of that.Gwyneth Paltrow is a good actress but she has certainly been better in other films where she had more interesting characters. Pepper Potts is in the film to be Stark's love interest and that's about it. She doesn't have many characteristics beyond the fact that she loves him and her major contribution to the plot is the requisite, though very entertaining, damsel in distress scenes. She is not a very strong character, I'm afraid, which is a shame as she is the only female character who appears in more than a few scenes. Theirs is also a pretty tepid romance. Jeff Bridges is excellent as Obadiah Stane, bringing his great talent to bear as the Stark Industries manager. While much of Stane's storyline was admittedly predictable, it was handled extremely well and there is a terrific sense of tension between Downey and Bridges for most of the film. Terrence Howard is great as Tony's best friend and military liaison Colonel James Rhodes and it is a shame that he did not return for any of the sequels. Shaun Toub gives one of the best performances in the film as Stark's fellow captive Yinsen - I thought that the character would be a villain when he was introduced but he turns out to be one of the most honest, decent characters in the film - while Farah Tahir is suitably creepy as the Ten Rings' leader Raza. As the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Paul Bettany has some great lines and his wry wit is a nice complement to Stark's. I loved the Stan Lee and Samuel L. Jackson cameos. Lee is such a legend that I have great affection for him even though I don't read Marvel Comics! The strongest scenes in the film are the ones in which Tony is held captive by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan and creates a rudimentary Iron Man suit out of scrap. I loved these scenes both because they were the perfect illustration of Tony's intelligence and resourcefulness and because Tony and Yinsen worked so well together. Speaking of Afghanistan, I really liked the manner in which the film handled the War on Terror. Its exploration of the morality of Tony's weapon systems was also very good. On the negative side, the film has some pretty serious pacing issues which last from Tony's rescue until his return to Afghanistan as Iron Man, which is about half an hour. Admittedly, these scenes were necessary for later on in the film but they were not terribly good or interesting. I often found myself bored during them, if I'm honest. However, the film rollicks along at a great pace from then until the end of the film. The battle scenes are hugely impressive, ""edge of your seat"" stuff, which is exactly what I want from a superhero film.Overall, this is an extremely good film which could have been an excellent one if it had not been for the aforementioned problems. I look forward to watching the rest of the films in the series.","8/10"
"Iron Man","pyrocitor","8 May 2008","With comic book films becoming an increasingly common component of the summer blockbuster season, the question emerges: how to make a mark as unique in the midst of so much superpowered competition while still holding true to the elements which made the originals such successes in the first place? It would seem director Jon Favreau has found the answer. From the opening chords of AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" it becomes instantly apparent that Iron Man is going to be a different kind of comic book movie. Instead of the filmmaker's usual aspirations to have the source material adapted as darker and grittier than its comic book origins could ever have been, Favreau is not afraid to embrace a very much needed sense of fun without descending into the rampant silliness which consumed Tim Story's Fantastic Four. As such, Iron Man essays a superb balance between embracing every last enjoyable detail while maintaining the gravitas and complexity of its original story and characters, a seamless melding of intelligence and action clout. What really sells the film is its intelligent script, with a series of astutely crafted lines a far cry from the usual clunking variety which could have been conceived by the average six year old boy. Favreau's Robert Altman influence also leads to some highly enjoyable improvisations on top of the scripted material (Downey Jr.'s exchanges with his robotic helpers are priceless). Similarly. by updating Stark's backstory from Vietnam to a more topical Afghanistan, the film has added political poignancy, making some intriguing tongue in cheek comments about the American military. While the occasional lapse in realism and occasionally conventional character motivations may prove problematic to some, such are easily excusable considering the medium from which the story is faithfully adapted, and Favreau's solid directing outweighs such inconsequential concerns with a sheer unabashed sense of enjoyment and unfiltered movie magic. Though the bulk of the story is dedicated to the usual origin tale, Favreau by no means skimps on the jaw-dropping action setpieces, generating some genuinely gripping and tense sequences (Stark's capture in Afghanistan is visceral and engrossing) as well as the requisite adrenaline pumping exhilarating ones - Stark's testing of his Mark One armour to escape captivity is full throttle entertainment and the final showdown is easily the show stopping setpiece of the year thus far. The film's flawless special effects are perfectly executed, used to full effect without ever swamping the picture. The Iron Man armour itself both looks and sounds brilliant, a clanking cacophony of assembled parts coming together for a heart pumping streamlined exterior. Similarly, the musical score, while not the most original, provides some suitably heroic themes and proves enthralling in its own right. Enough praise cannot be bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr., who, overcoming every last inch of apprehension over his casting, is by far the key element to Iron Man's standing out from the waves of other superhero films. Delivering one of the strongest performances in his formidable career, Downey Jr. effortlessly inhabits every last contradictory inch of Tony Stark like the pristine suits the character himself dons. Putting his own unorthodox spin on the character through his wisecracking, motormouthed energy, Downey Jr. still stays true to the spirit of Stark and his darker overtones, even making the transition from callous, arrogant billionaire weapons vendor to iron clad humanitarian feasible through his extraordinary charisma and gleaming, passionate intensity. To say that Downey Jr. is perfect for the role is an understatement; a testament to the use of quality actors for bringing immortalised comic book figures to life instead of ham-handed fresh young faces chosen for looks over talent. While the rest of the cast cannot quite match up to Downey Jr.'s dynamo of a performance, all prove equally adept in adapting their comic book incarnations in a plausible fashion. Terrence Howard delivers an appropriately curt dignity to Stark's military ally Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes, adding the perfect clipped acerbic deadpan to the character. Similarly, Gwyneth Paltrow makes a surprisingly convincing potential love interest as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts, her natural charisma and share of icy comebacks easily proving a superb foil to Downey Jr.'s livewire of a performance. Jeff Bridges moulds his usual laid back image into one of a despicably greedy businessman concealing his shockingly selfish dealings under a veneer of oily respectability, his unconventional performance easily overcoming the trappings of his otherwise conventional villain figure. Shaun Toub is charming as Yinsen, the mysterious scientist who saves Stark's life in Afghanistan and helps him construct his first suit of armour, with Toub's irreverent edge preventing the role from becoming a stock ""mentor"" figure. Simply put, Iron Man is everything a comic book movie could hope to be: a perfect balance between the grittily serious and exuberantly enjoyable, flawless special effects and a roster of incredible performances. Iron Man proves an example of the quintessential blockbuster: one not afraid to think while simultaneously bludgeoning with entertainment - for those in search of entertainment without jeopardising brain cells, Iron Man should prove just the thing. -10/10","9/10"
"Iron Man","the-gossip-king","17 April 2008","Lets face it. Iron Man is not the most famous of comic superheroes. In fact, up until now I had only head about it briefly. I also found out that it was from Marvel and since I love Spiderman so much I decided I would go and check it out. Wow! This movie is awesome!. Acting is great and I am so happy to see Gwyneth Paltrow back in the movie business after a while. Robert Downey junior was also really good as the sleazy millionaire turned superhero. The villain was great (i forget his name) and Terrence Howard was great as well. The action and visual effects were really good and the movies talk on terrorism is very intriguing. Overall, a great movie. I think Marvel should be very pleased.","10/10"
"Iron Man","Danusha_Goska","18 May 2008","""Iron Man""'s best feature is its cast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terence Howard, Clark Gregg and Shaun Toub are all serious actors who have been in actually good movies. They can afford to slum in drek like this. They don't slum, though. All of them act up a storm, as if the script were actually worth something. Good for them. Robert Downey Jr. is fascinating to watch, and Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable and appealing as something of a female lead (remember, this is a movie for boys.) Otherwise, though, ""Iron Man"" is not one of those comic book movies like the Christian Bale ""Batman"" or the over the top, guilty pleasure ""300"" that transcends its genre. ""Iron Man"" is an obvious, pathetic fantasy for men and boys who are insecure because they feel unattractive, weak, stupid, and incompetent. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is granted superhuman powers of intelligence, sex appeal, and power. The movie, heavy-handed and obvious, announces, within the first five minutes, that Tony Stark had sex with all of Maxxim's cover models, and, presumably as part of his super powers, he apparently did not contract one social disease by doing so. Stark goes on to seduce a woman who hates him, and, again this is all within the first few minutes. He stiffs his friend to play dice in Vegas, he flies his private jet around the world, and, in a cave, using scrap metal and an open fire, he invents a wearable suit that resists close range automatic weapons fire. He also, for some reason, inserts a glowing device, that looks a lot like a smoke detector, into his chest. Tony lives in a spectacular house in Malibu, he parks shiny sports cars where the camera will be sure to see them, and a train of white, black, young, and old sycophants follow him around, complimenting his every move. Gee, Tony, you're a genius. Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, whatever. Even within the boundaries of comic book movies, none of this is believable, and it's frightening to think of the childlike minds that will find it appealing.The movie lacks a strong narrative drive. Tony's agenda, his enemies, his location, and even his Iron Man suit, change too often. The movie is chopped into episodic bits. The plot twists are not surprising.","6/10"
"Iron Man","Turfseer","10 May 2008","This is basically 'Robocop' updated to 2008. Except it's nowhere as good as that film. The '87 thriller is set in the future with an equally implausible scenario, but far more intriguing: the body of a murdered police officer is used to create a robot who still retains traces of the dead man's memories. The core of Iron Man is plain silly: set in the present time, the iron man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) must prance around with some kind of magnet implanted in his chest cavity, preventing shrapnel from puncturing his heart. Then, he invents an iron suit which enables him to fly at supersonic speeds and kill terrorists without suffering serious injury. Like Robocop, a computer interface is suggested inside the 'mask' of both superheroes; but in Robocop the hero is haunted by the memories of the dead man whose body was used to create him.There is no such internal tension in Iron Man. It's strictly a good guy-bad guy shoot 'em up. Downey plays Stark, the head of a large corporation which manufactures weapons. Stark is depicted as an arrogant playboy who takes no precautions when he travels around in a Humvee in Afghanistan. He ends up being captured by a local warlord and his crew of motley insurgents and realizes that they have been using his company's weapons to fight US troops. Now he suddenly has a change of heart and uses his skills (he's a genius!) to create an iron man outfit to escape the bad guys (they think he's working on a missile).When he returns to the US, he decides to utilize the prototype of the iron man outfit he created in Afghanistan to become a superhero fighting for good. A good part of the film is taken up with Downey designing the new Iron Man outfit; during the 'testing phase' he gets thrown against the walls of his laboratory numerous times (how exciting!). Finally, he starts flying through the air with this metal suit on and almost crashes when he goes too high up in the atmosphere and his suit gets frozen with ice (funny how he wasn't smart enough to invent some kind of deicing device contained on most commercial aircrafts).Terrence Howard (of 'Hustle & Flow' fame) isn't doing much hustling and flowing here in a do-nothing part as an army liaison officer for the munitions company. Similarly Gwyneth Paltrow, Stark's personal assistant, engages in a great deal of pointless banter leading to a non-romantic moment at the film's denouement. Jeff Bridges probably has the best part as Downey's partner in the multinational corporation who ends up betraying him and working with the warlords and terrorists in Afghanistan. But how did he so easily get past the alarm system or other security devices in Downey's home? You would think that breaking into a home like that wouldn't be so easy.In the end, there is the obligatory battle between the two machines (done much better in Teriminator 2). Bridges looks ridiculous when he takes off his metal helmet and all you see is his face inside the metal contraption. I fail to see why so many critics gave this film good marks. It's strictly a film for uneducated teenagers who read comic books all day. It also serves to lull people in this country into a false sense of security vis-a-vis the terrorist threat. By creating an invincible 'Iron Man"" who can easily mow down terrorists and bad guys, it makes us forget that the bad guys in real life are not so easily defeated. Case in point: 9/11. The only winners here are the actors who collected nice paychecks for participating in such a cheesy and worthless venture.","8/10"
"Iron Man","RainDogJr","30 April 2008","I'm a casual reader of comic books so definitely I'm not the biggest fan of the Marvel world and I don't know all the details of every Marvel story. Anyway, I do like a lot superheroes and of course their enemies (sometimes even more) but definitely Iron Man is not my favourite, probably is Spider-Man. But since I knew that they were making this film I was kind of exciting, of course for the cast too, about it and for me it was really quick it's release. The fact that it doesn't have the big publicity of films like ""Spider-Man 3"" or the upcoming ""The Dark Knight"" (even ""Speed Racer"" in those days has a bigger publicity with all kind of products), was also good but even with less publicity they just make a good damn thing for their business making it's release today, the day of the children in Mexico and also selling the fact that in the US it doesn't opens until the next Friday. So here I'm writing about it just after returning from the theater after enjoyed a lot this great picture.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is just a genius of technology but also a bastard. He is the ultimate designer of weapons and his company is really powerful but dealing with this kind of clients will be always dangerous. Suddenly he reborn, finally opening his eyes and waking up from a dream full of parties, women and power to realize that he was providing amazing technology to the wrong persons. He is IRON MAN. That story about the present situation with the war is really good having in Stark the kind of businessman who never cares about anything but his company's interests. Definitely this background is not important for a child but of course there is great action and great visuals. And there are many funny things especially for a really cool Downey Jr. and his character's attitude before his experiences with the terrorists. Talking about the cast, I think Downey Jr. is really good for the main role as Stark and as Iron Man, well anybody could look really cool with a suit like that. The Dude, Jeff Bridges, is also a good villain and the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow is just perfect in all the ways.Conclusion: ""Iron Man"" is a great pre-summer film, for me much better than the recent Marvel adaptations. I loved the trailer for Black Sabbath's Iron Man and here the closing titles are just terrific (Back in Black is also great but some other music in the film is not) but damn I didn't wait until the very end (but definitely I could watch it again) and now I know that Samuel L. Jackson is also here. F*ck right now I hate him mostly because his story with Troma but that's another story. Anyway I really enjoyed this film and of course I'm ready for the next chapter, maybe the second of 15. It's only the decision of the studio because Downey Jr. is more than ready!","10/10"
"Iron Man","colonel_green","1 May 2008","It'll take another viewing to confirm, but we may possibly have reached Nerdvana with this movie (incidentally, we got a trailer for The Dark Knight, but it was the teaser they initially released; meh; also, there was the Incredible Hulk teaser, which people seemed to like). I got into comics through the animated adaptations of things like Spider-Man and X-Men, so I only knew of Iron Man from his appearances in the 90s Spidey cartoon for a while. Recently, though, you can't throw a rock in the Marvel Universe without hitting Tony Stark, and I've been following the excellent current run by Charles and Daniel Knauf, as well as his appearances in other titles like Captain America, and reading the collected editions of his classic stories.Looking only at the plot, this is a pretty standard origin film; we get the modern version of Tony's beginnings as detailed by Warren Ellis in ""Extremis"" (with Afghanistan instead of Vietnam), and Pepper Potts is Tony's Girl Friday, though otherwise this is strongly influenced by the Layton/Michelinie period, particularly the presence of James Rhodes as the lead male supporting character, the main villain, Obadiah Stane (he doesn't last enough to be christened the Iron Monger formally, though he uses the term in conversation earlier), and Tony's immediate motivation for becoming a superhero, which is modelled heavily on ""Armour Wars"". But it's the execution, the details, and, yes, the Downey Jr., that make all the difference. Robert Downey Jr. owns all, no doubt; he's utterly fantastic as Tony Stark. Jeff Bridges is very strong as Stane; he's up there with McKellen and Defoe as realizing the best film villains of the current revival. At first I was a bit put off by Terrence Howard's voice as Rhodey (softer than I had imagined; in my head he's always been more of a Dorn/Haysbert type), but he's good; Paltrow does a good job too.The film is peppered with setup for future stuff: SHIELD (and, if you stay after the credits, ole Nick himself, talking about his ""Avenger Initiative""), an expansive terrorist network referred to as the ""Ten Rings"" (of the Mandarin), and, my favourite, Rhodey vowing ""next time, baby"" on seeing a silver-grey suit of Iron Man armour.Mild criticism might be that the final defeat of the Iron Monger is vague and not especially climactic, but it suits the purpose well enough, and the preceding fight between the two armoured knights is awesome.10/10.","9/10"

"Iron Man","Al_The_Strange","3 May 2015","By 2008, there were already a bunch of Marvel movies on the market, all presented as a big mixed cluster of varying quality and quantity. After pulling itself together as its own studio, Marvel kicked off Phase 1 of its new movie-making universe with Iron Man.From start to finish, this is one cool film. It is very sharply-made, with a very slick and high-quality look and feel. It's evenly-paced, with equal parts color, comedy, and action. And when the action hits, it is really cool stuff, without going too far overboard. Among Iron Man's heroics, my favorite scene shows him rocketing to the other side of the world, to use his high-tech suit to beat up violent extremists to protect the innocent (blowing up a tank in the process, before being pursued by American jets in a great high-speed air chase scene). The film's climax features an all-out fight between two high-powered suits, during which there's plenty of mass destruction. Even when there aren't guns and rockets going off, the film is still a blast with its colorful inter-character exchanges, funny suit-testing scenes, tense inter-corporate conspiracies.The story this film tells is a great one. The origins of Iron Man is inherently compelling, as it takes a greedy, narcissistic arms dealer and flips him on his head to turn him into a hero. The film does so by plunging the character into the heart of the very problems he's created (in a war-town part of the world nonetheless). Once Tony Stark dedicates himself to being Iron Man, the conflict shifts to him confronting everybody else around him. Through all the struggles he endures, the film lays out rich characterization and interesting thematic material worth exploring.This film looks splendid, with quality photography and editing. Acting is quite spot-on: Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as the title character, and he remains iconic through every other Marvel project he's in from here on out. Gweneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Shaun Toub, and everybody else is great to watch as well. Writing is pretty good and sharp. This production uses spectacular-looking sets, props, and costumes. Most special effects hold up well, and are awesome to behold. Ramin Djawadi's music score is pretty cool too.The first Iron Man film has everything you can ask for in a superhero film: thrilling action, amusing humor, a decent story, and characters we can care about. Even after having numerous other Marvel films come out since, this is still the biggest must-see of the lot.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)","8/10"
"Iron Man","RyanCShowers","5 August 2013","Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN (2008)I'm not a fan of superhero-origin stories, but with the original Iron Man, I never felt like the filmmakers woke up and said ""Let's Make a Superhero movie!"" What the film implies the director and stars felt like when they started each day of filming is ""Let's make the best movie we can make."" Iron Man doesn't meander in scenes that are purely self-serving to remind everyone we're watching a superhero movie. Though it has its comic-booky undertones, Iron Man instead is an impacting, polished, and enthralling film about a man who finds redemption in an unconventional way. It's not about the ""superhero"", it's about the process of becoming a hero. It's enjoyable spectacle, but also has a lot to offer its genre intellectually and creatively. Iron Man fits together as tightly as Gwyneth Paltrow's calves and is as clever as Downey's comebacks. While never feeling established as a genre picture, it fulfills every expectation you could have going in. Rating: 8/10Grade: A-I couldn't discuss the Iron Man films without paying respect to the comparison between this series and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series. I find the original Iron Man to introduce the story and develop it's characters better, even if it may lack the craftsmanship of Batman Begins. Nolan got the more impressive sequels, however. Contrast. Anyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. ""I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow"" said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.","1/10"
"Iron Man","Shad_Critic","5 March 2015","First of all, Iron Man is truly awesome! Every scene was great and there was almost no boring parts in the movie. Iron Man is the best out of the three. Iron Man 2 was boring and Iron Man 3 was just disappointing. Iron Man was a part where the Marvel Cinematic Universe began. And yes, it was a good start. But the sad part is the last 2 movies left a legacy of mediocrity. At least it had the chance to redeem itself through the movie The Avengers. Maybe, Iron Man would redeem itself again on Avengers Age Of Ultron.In conclusion, Iron Man was great! A good start to the franchise and the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.","1/10"
"Iron Man","Merklin","8 July 2008","In the last couple of years, comic book based super hero movies have had a mission to accomplish and thats kick starting a franchise.The likes of Fantastic four, batman begins, daredevil and hulk to name a few, were made to be the start of a series. Iron man is no different, but where many of these sorts of films fail, Iron Man succeeds because it not only gets the series started but its a damn good film in its own right.Exciting, funny and well acted, iron man is an all round great effort that sticks surprisingly close to its source material. The high octane sequences where iron man soars through the air and kicks bad guys asses are awesome to watch but thankfully this is a film where things are just as interesting to watch when no one is blowing anything up and its all thanks to the Jon Favreau careful direction. The plot, in which billionaire tony starks turns from brash playboy to amour clad hero, is engaging and enthralling and favreaus eye for great acting ensures some great naturalistic performances.There are two stand out performances, the first and most important being Robert Downey Juniour as Tony Stark. Junior makes this role his own, injecting Tony Stark with a sense of cool, arrogance and an Errol Flynn like swagger that makes him really fun to watch and get behind as a leading man. The second (which surprisingly doesn't get as much praise as Downeys stark) is Jeff Bridges as bad guy Obadiah Stane. Although he could have played the role as a scenery chewing , typical villain, Bridges injects the role with a sense of realism and imposing menace, making for a convincing antagonist.Iron Man is what a marvel comic book movie should be- a mix of great story ,exciting action, and a faithful representation of a classic character.","9/10"
"Iron Man","smg242","20 June 2014","1000th review!!! Spoilers, though!The 2008 Iron Man movie is one that I consider to be one of the best of its genre. I mean, you've got the laid-back, smooth direction of Jon Favreau, a GREAT villain played by Jeff 'Lebowski' Bridges, a tight, yet simplistic but hard-hitting plot, and to top it all, the charisma and nuance of Robert Downey Jr. as billionaire Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. Pepper all that with fantastic special effects and CGI.I've doubted Marvel in the past, I thought Daredevil was pretty bad, and the Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider movies were bad. Also, the third parts of the X-Men and Blade movies sucked. But they nailed it with this one. I can't really explain how I instantly fell in love with it. It's like some of the 80s kids and the '89 Batman movie. It just has that sort of charm!Speaking of Batman, this movie came out as the same year as The Dark Knight. While TDK is clearly the better film, I still prefer this one over it. Maybe it's because Batman acted like a p*ssy following TDK, and went into 'exile'. Whereas, Stark publicly announces that he's Iron Man in this movie.Thank you, Marvel, for starting off the stellar Avengers universe with this fantastic film.","9/10"
"Iron Man","owen-watts","16 October 2020","The faltering babysteps of the ginormous MCU lie in this deeply uneven late noughties superhero venture. Downey Jr is, of course, a charismatic presence but he eats too much screen time and literally no one else gets a look-in or any real motivation. The crass boyish sexism and heavy-handed ""vague terrorist group"" have dated appallingly but the suit is the star and the sleek Stan Winston/ILM fusion still feels vibrant. It's definitely a mixed bag rather than a strong foundation but the building blocks are there and the weight of where it all leads lends it a far more tolerable aspect.","8/10"
"Iron Man","tindfoting","28 May 2022","It's hard to imagine now, 12 years later, Marvel took a CHANCE on the ""not so famous as Spider-Man"", greenlighting the still very popular comic book Iron Man. Hiring Robert Downey jr was probably the boldest move, the actor being a part of the brat pack with a seriously long list of drug charges and Betty Ford visits. But it worked! Downey plays the snarky, irritating Tony Stark to A+ in my book, being a truly prominent warmonger... until he isnt. Later, being captured by some Afghan guerilla (probably with good reason, since Stark provides weapons), he proves his brilliance by making Iron Man suit Mark I. I dug how mechanical and primitive it all looked. Compared to a dozen years later, IM 1 looks refreshingly more old school technically, and Jon Fevrau has no rush really to show us all the action. This is more a redemption story about Tony Stark, coming to terms not only with how he (and his dad) has become billionairs, but also his own mortality (that splinter that's inches from his heart). Off course, the 3rd part of the movie goes all in CGI, with a weak villain in Jeff Bridges (I love him, but here he is way OTT). In the end a very good intro too the everlasting MCU. With AC/DC and the immortal line in the end; ""I am Iron Man"". The 1st was also the best of the trilogy.","7/10"

"Iron Man","tedg","2 May 2008","I did not expect much from this. Marvel just seems to make what seems to me ordinary, boring movies. I was hopeful this time because the three main actors have done some rather elaborate work so far as reflected acting. Downey is something of a prince at this business of simultaneous personalities.But we have none of that here. I just saw ""Forbidden Kingdom"" and it uses what is now the state of the art regarding cameras in fights: the camera dances. It folds us into the action. Not so with any Marvel-produced project. We might as well be watching C D deMille with color.Nearly all these Marvel stories are predicated on science gone wrong. Contrast that to heroes from other companies, where it is just cosmic reality or even training that happens to make someone special. But these stories all derive from the Japanese pattern of postwar antiscience movies which in turn were based on ""Frankenstein."" (The Japanese would not have known the earlier gollum films.)So the driving force here is science. As it happens, I would have been disappointed by the blandness of everything, but they ruined the driving force of science for me. Stark was supposed to have gone to MIT with Colonel Rhodes (who wears an MIT ring), but we are told Stark was summa cum laude at MIT. But that school is unique in never engaging in that foolishness. Think about it.But what's a greater offense is how this, the man with the best mind, the most money and the most advanced science, does his work. I'm thinking particularly of the computers. This is the one place where we could have been dazzled. But what we see is ordinary, as if it were envisioned not by a man with great imagination and inventiveness, but by someone who simply doesn't know.Suppose you were shown a car from 50 years in the future and it had a key, steering wheel and dial speedometer. Its the same effect, and sorta takes the gas out of the thing.Oh, they made Gwyneth a redhead.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","9/10"
"Iron Man","Terryfan","4 April 2015","Now it's not always a movie based off a comic book would do it justice however Iron-Man hit all the right notes.Iron Man begin a series of films based in has been called The Marvel Climatic Universe.This film centers around the origin of Iron Man as Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr) as he wants to rid the world of weapons after being taken hostage. This leads Obadiah Stane (Played by Jeff Bridges) to begin questioning his mind.With help from Pepper Potts (Played by Gwyneth Paltrow) his assistant to help keep his affairs in order at Stark Industries along with his best friend Rhodey (Played by Terrence Howard).The plot of the film is one of the strong holds to Iron Man as it explain how Tony Stalk would become Iron Man and any fan of Iron Man would appreciate itWhile I wasn't sure much about Robert Downey Jr but after watching Iron Man it was clear he was born to play this role his performance in this film shows you can pull yourself out of a jam and become better and this film show case his talents as a actor because he brought Tony Stark to life on the big screen.Jeff Bridges went so far as to shaving his head bald like Obadiah in the comic books because he wanted to make sure he made the fans happy by looking like the character from the comics which is true to honoring the craft of acting.Gwyneth did pretty well as Pepper as in terms of her services to the role. The acting in the film is pretty strong as you see the cast pulling out the best of their talents to the film and there is a good bit of humor in the film.Action for this film is some of the best ever done in a film and some of the most creative as well you have to see the film to appreciate it Music wise is pretty awesome as it include Black Sabbath ""Iron Man"" along with other original music to tell the story of each scene.The Special effects in the film are top notch the suits for Iron Man are very well design and detail as it shows the power of how C G I can be done for any film.Iron Man does a very well done film with story telling, acting and amazing special effects if you want to appreciate a good comic book movie watch Iron ManI give Iron Man an 9 out of 10","8/10"
"Iron Man","Rage-Kage","15 June 2014","I have been a big fan of superhero movies every since I was 8 and the first Spiderman movie came out however I was not much of a movie fan overall until The Avengers was released in 2012. So that being said when Iron Man was first released I didn't really care. I did however see the Hulk because unlike Iron Man I had heard of him before because of the 2003 Hulk movie. I finally saw this movie in 2010 right before the release of Iron Man 2 nd have been a fan ever since. I actually did not know that all of these Marvel movies were part of the same universe until about 6 months before The Avengers was released and ever since finding that out I have been immersed into this amazing movie world that Marvel has set up.Everybody knows the plot to this movie so I don't need to go into detail. Tony Stark is taken prisoner by terrorists he creates Iron Man and escapes and beats the bad guys. It's really awesome to see Iron Man just flying around. In 2008 especially because there had not really been anything like it in a superhero movie before. The way it looks when it flys or in combat it's like watching an actually piece of advanced weaponry entering a war zone. One thing in particular that is really cool to see in this movie is Tony Stark using every possible available resource including his own mind to his advantage. Everything from first building the Iron Man suit to actually using it does a great job showing that Tony Stark is a genius. He proves even this early on in the MCU that he is Iron Man with or without the suit.The acting like everything else is of course great especially form Robert Downey Jr. Which was of course a big surprise considering he had been on the down slope for at least 10 years prior to the release of this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow did a good job as Pepper Potts though I don't particularly like her as an actor. I don't have anything against her I'm just not a big fan but with that in mind she did a good job throughout the entire trilogy as well as in her short appearance in The Avengers. Her and Robert Downey Jr. work really well together and have a good believable relationship in these movies. Terrence Howard did an OK job as Rhodey but I personally like Don Cheadle a lot more. Of course you can't go wrong with Jeff Bridges in anything so I don't even need to talk about him but I will say he makes a great villain.So overall Iron Man is a great and really entertaining movie as well as the start of an amazing universe of movies. If you've somehow managed not to see Iron Man yet... why? Between all the easter eggs from comics and other movies the tie ins and the superhero awesomness there is no reason for any comic book or movie fan to be left out of this truly amazing world that Marvel has created.I give Iron Man a 10/10","9/10"
"Iron Man","jerekra","11 June 2009","Iron Man is a Marvel Film that is better than many other Marvel Films that I have seen recently.Tony Stark is kidnapped while he is over seas demonstrating some new weapons for the military. Once captured, he is forced to build a bomb but instead he builds a suit that he uses to escape from his kidnappers. As he returns home Stark decides that he must stop his company from manufacturing weapons and also begins to build a new suit that he can use to fight against evil.A major strength to this film is a strong lead character who plays the role greatly. In Spiderman I felt that they could have chosen a better actor to play Spiderman but I think that Robert Downey Jr. is great at portraying Tony Stark. Stark comes off as intelligent, funny, and in complete control in this film. Downey Jr. was a great choice as Iron Man and I look forward to seeing him in the sequel.The Iron Man suit in this film is awesome. The effects are phenomenal and outstanding at the same time. Especially the scenes where Iron Man is flying around. This really is some of the best special effects that I have seen in a film and it makes every scene involving Iron Man marvelous.I think the story is good as well. It is not too complex like another super hero film that came out the same summer. (Dark Knight) THe story picks up right away and the main conflict is upon the audience very soon. Also I like how you do not go through all of Tony Starks life and how he is given a brief back story at the beginning. This helps the story to get going.A few minor problems. For one, you really have to wait a while before Stark makes the real Iron Man suit. However I do understand that this is the film where they needed to show how the suit gets built and so on. You just have to wait a while to see Stark in the final awesome looking suit.Also I think Iron Man could have been in it a little more. It is cool seeing Tony Stark a lot, but it would have been nice to see him in the Iron Man costume more.The action is good in this film, but nothing too special. The final battle at the end is OK, but it left something to be desired.Also the supporting cast was nothing special. TOny Stark was awesome but the rest of the cast was OK. I can see why a lot of the cast is going to be changed for the next film. Sorry Terrance Howard.So this film is a lot better than the Fantastic Four films, X men films, and the Hulk FIlms. ALso I think it is better than SPiderman 2 and 3. It has a great leading actor, great effects, and a strong story and conflict. I recommend it.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Jacques98","8 December 2008","It seems like an obsession with Hollywood to take something intentionally childish and make it ""mature"". You know what I'm talking about. The new Bond movies, the new Batman movies, Transformers, etc., etc. What Hollywood fails to realize is that only one out of every ten movies that follows this style actually ends up being a worthwhile movie.Iron Man is simply one of the nine failures.Outside of the first forty-five minutes, the entire plot line is corny and a wholesale cliché. Elaborating, Iron Man tries to be mature by mixing in the war in the middle-east. It works. That is, it works until the plot turns into the exact same plot as every other sub-par superhero movie out there. It becomes obvious by the first thirty minutes that no good person can die, and all the bad people all cackle oh-so-evilly and have no more intelligence than an average paperweight. By this point you forget the maturity of the movie's opening, and all there is to do is laugh at the impossibly cliché story. It's like watching one of the old cartoons where the good guys always win and the bad guys always have evil-looking beard stubble and talk intelligently only to be slight-handed by the more intelligent good guy. This is the ""mature"" superhero movie everyone told me about? But there is a good chance you didn't watch Iron Man for the plot. You watched it for the action. The only problem with that is there is only two action scenesyes, I counted. One in the opening and one in the ending, with a few spurts of action between that last a whole thirty seconds of screen time. The first one is well-done and actually made me think this could be a decent movie. The last, however, is possibly one of the most unintentionally hilarious climactic scenes of all time. Even if I ignore the fact it's almost copy/pasted in entirety from a Mystery Science 3000 episode, some of the worst CGI used since I Am Legend ruins anything cool about it.The space between the two action scenes is filled with some of the most cliché plotting I've seen in years, as I stated above. Put simply, there is nothing entertaining here. While Robert Downey Jr. plays his role perfectly as usual and puts on a pretty nice comedic bit every few scenes, he can't let me forget the sinking feeling in my gut that this is one of the most boring superhero movies ever made.What more is there for me to say? My pretentious critic conclusion: Iron Man is a severely clichéd, technically poor film with little entertainment value.Half-drunk, adverage joe conclusion: Iron Man is boring and lame. No way is this better than The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2! Both are correct. Iron Man has made me personally give up all hope on the superhero genre.0/10","9/10"
"Iron Man","1bilbo","25 December 2008","If you like lots of running around, lots of CGI and lots of explosions then this is for you. This movie is just following a well worn formulae and is nothing more than every other super hero movie rolled into one.A man is captured and kept in a cave for three months during which time he is ordered to construct a ""Super destructive"" weapon out of bits of other captured weapons. Instead he constructs a super metal skin with built in flame throwers that is so strong that it resists 1000s of bullets rained down on it. Then he is walking around a desert when - of all the luck - a series of helicopters just happen to find him. Next he gets back to his own lab and manages to construct a metal suit that can fly and do battle. Yawn.The predictable - bad guy in the camp - ending is really obvious and tedious.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Bruce722","24 May 2013","Hands down one of the best superhero movies ever made. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Tony Stark/Iron Man and the rest of the cast is great as well. They give life to the characters and are all amazing actors. The action sequences were done really well also. This movie has humor, drama, action, romance, intensity, and is told well. The only real issue with the plot itself is that there are a few major plot holes towards the end. For example, how is Obadiah able to see what Pepper downloaded from the computer, check on the progress of his own suit, and then get to Tony's house before Pepper even has a chance to call Tony? Another thing, how does Obadiah get into Tony's house so easily in the first place? Wouldn't you think a genius billionaire like Tony Stark has a halfway decent security system or that Jarvis would've notified Tony? Lastly, how is Obadiah able to master the nuances of his suit immediately without having any trial phase? It took Tony quit a while to master his suit's various functions and yet Obadiah was able to do this right away. These things take away from the movie and prevent it from being a perfect 10/10 but the film was still great. If you're willing to overlook a few flaws then you'll enjoy this a lot.","8/10"
"Iron Man","departed07","13 October 2008","Marvel comics has unleashed superhero movies from The Spider-Man Trilogy, The X-Men Trilogy, The Hulk films, The Fantastic Four films, The Punisher, Blade, and Ghost Rider, where now the metallic superhero Iron Man makes his screen debut.To be honest, I didn't know too much about Anthony Stark and his alter ego Iron Man since I was into Spider-Man, the X-Men and Hulk. But once I slipped on the DVD, I got more than I bargain for.Robert Downey Jr. portrays smart technician billionaire and media lover Tony Stark who's gone off to Iraq in showing the army the latest weapons he created until being captured by the enemy. While being a prisoner, he must make the weapons or else he'll be killed off; his heart has been transplanted by a ball device where if it's taken off his chest, he'll die instantly. As a prisoner, Tony gets help from another prisoner by creating a metallic suit to shield himself as he escapes from the underground caves and later thinks about how with his inventions he can get rid of evil after learning that his weapons were not only used by the U.S. army but by the Iraq soldiers as well.It's fun to watch Downey Jr.'s character as Stark trying to reinvent the machine and at the same time learning from his mistakes that nobody's perfect. His performance is a balanced of comedy and serious technique like watching Bill Murray in Ghostbusters. Tony Stark/Iron Man is a good comeback for Robert Downey Jr. who's really had a bit of ups and downs in the past years of his career, but he finally found the right character at last.Jon Favreau (Swingers) directs the film balancing a sense of reality along with mixing humor, action, a bit of romance, adventure, screw-ups, and thrills along the way. Other than Downey Jr. in the film, Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Stark's assistant Pepper Potts who isn't a damsel in distress compared to most leading ladies but a tough cookie who knows everything about her employer and speaks the truth. Terrance Howard plays Stark's friend Col. James Rhodes who'll back him up in anyway while making sure that the billionaire doesn't do anything to screw up. And there's Jeff Bridges who plays Obidiah Stane, Stark's business partner with a few secrets of his own.To conclude, Iron Man rocks in every way! Just be sure to stick around after the credits to see Samuel L. Jackson's cameo performance as Nick Fury.","8/10"

"Iron Man","ikanboy","4 May 2008","This has been billed as a smarter, tighter super hero movie. It's not. It's entertaining, and has all the special effects one takes for granted, but it is still riddled with the same old clichés expected from the genre. I had hoped that the movie would stay more in Afghanistan - anywhere but Calipornia - but it gets bogged down as soon as Iron Man does his one piece of obligatory super hero rescuing the average guys from evildoers, and returns to the usual (yawn) struggle with evil corporate magnates determined to make more money and stoke the ego incarnate.The audience I saw it with clapped and cheered and laughed, and I take it that the average movie goer joe is happy with being treated once again to mindless escapism for the summer. My grandkids liked it, and what else can one ask from Hollywood.","7/10"
"Iron Man","robsta23","17 April 2015","Most superhero movies turn into franchises, unless you're talking about the two different Hulk movies, and the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story. Iron Man is an exception - it is wildly entertaining.I think Robert Downey Jr. nails his role as Tony Stark. So he can get an Oscar nomination for Tropic Thunder but not for this? Johnny Depp can be nominated for Pirates but RDJ can't be nominated for Iron Man? Robert Downey Jr successfully brings Tony Stark to life in this live-action film, showing a big ego along with insecurities such as his on and off feelings for Pepper and his realization that he must sometimes depend on the help of others.There are plenty of humorous parts in the film as well, a lot of them revolving around Tony, but who can't laugh at such a great portrayal of a jackass? The funniest part for me had to be when a scientist apologizes for not being Tony Stark.Towards the conclusion of the movie some aspects do not add up, especially involving Obediah. He has Tony's suit recreated and just happens to know how to run it properly on his first go? Tony is directly over the blast Pepper starts in order to finish off Obediah, and is hardly affected? The third act is everything when it comes to an action film, and it is sad to see some movies take shortcuts to develop a good third act instead of a great one. However, the third act is redeemed so to speak with the iconic ending of Tony Stark admitting he is Iron Man.Fun first installment with an okay third act.","4/10"
"Iron Man","thesouthfamily2-552-707097","31 March 2014","The world needs more comic book movies like these; but if we must have one more, ""Iron Man"" is a blueprint for said films. Not only is it a good comic book movie (smart and stupid, stirring and silly, intimate and spectacular), it's winning enough to engage even those who've never cared much for comic books or the movies they spawn.Tony Stark (played brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr.) not only makes the character memorable, but also makes it special. Downey's performance is intriguing, and unexpected. He doesn't behave like most superheroes: he lacks the psychic weight and gravitas. Tony Stark is created from the persona Downey has fashioned through many movies: irreverent, quirky, self-deprecating, wise- cracking. So comfortable is Downey with Tony Stark's dialogue, so familiar does it sound coming from him, that the screenplay seems almost to have been dictated by Downey's persona.But a great hero can only be good as it's villain, and Jeff Bridges gives us a great and memorable performance. It would be so easy to make him a stereotypical villain; but instead, the character of Obadiah Stane plays both the voice of reason for Tony and also the cunning villain that does deals under the table. Instead of being the villain that is so obvious to the audience, he adds charm and personality to the character to make him unique and charismatic.But what also makes the movie work is Stark's relationship with everyone in the cast: not just Obadiah Stane, but also Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). She plays his caretaker/butler, but there is this connection to these two. It would've been easier to make them love interests from the beginning, but they play with that cliché. Also, I like his relationship with Rhodes (Terrence Howard). They bicker a lot, but they also help each other out in a playful way. It's very genuine these relationships that Stark has with these characters, and they don't feel forced. They feel like it adds character to who he is outside of being a snarky tech-wise genius.Everything that Jon Favreu has made a fantastic comic book movie that is not only pleasing to comic book readers, but also people who are not fans of comic books. At the end of the day, it's Robert Downey Jr. lifts up, and brings this character to life through character interaction and through legit drama that makes him go through a legitimate story arc. By building on that, Favreau found his movie, and it's a good one.","8/10"
"Iron Man","bob the moo","11 September 2008","Growing up, Tony Stark was always good with machines  very good. This pleased his father, who was equally as skilled and had built his internationally successful weapons company up from the ground with the sole aim of arming his country to help them win the wars they face. When his father died when he was still young, the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but, at 21, Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and, it must be said, something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out, but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture  an announcement that dismays Stane and the board, but not as much as his other plans would.Iron Man was more or less the first big film of the summer and, unlike the blockbuster season of 2007 it was a good start because Iron Man pretty much did everything that a Blockbuster should. It is big noisy fun, with good action sequences, comedy and effects and it is yet another superhero movie  which is the only thing about it that gave me cause for concern. The thing is, as good as some of them are, we also have lame ones where the focus is on the effects and nothing else. Iron Man is not the new Batman films but nor is it anywhere near the level of Fantastic Four, if anything it is like what one would want Fantastic Four to be like. I say this meaning that Iron Man has a solid plot (although the ""developmental"" film is generally the ""easiest"" one to get right), fun characters and a good sense of humour thanks to the character of Stark  I mean, I like Batman's tortured psyche as a subject but Stark would be a lot more fun to hang out with.Towards the end, the plot suddenly moves past the developmental plot line and gets to the ""conclusion"". It is noisy and not as exciting as I would have liked but it is good enough to satisfy those who want to see their money up on the screen. For me the rest of the film was stronger as it focused on Stark, who is nailed by a perfectly cast Downey Jr. His acerbic sense of humour and real lifestyle of excess helps the film and he is an enjoyable centre piece who remains a presence even when he is just a CGI effect on screen. Paltrow looks good and fills the undemanding role well despite me personally not liking her that much. Bridges was a solid presence for the most part, even if not that much is made of him, while Howard is a good name to allow the series to continue with stars on board. I didn't think that Favreau would be up to the task since this is really his first big budget action film but, while not anything special, he did a good job and perhaps it helped with the humour to have him on board but we shall see if he returns with Iron Man 2 (which I'm assuming is a given as a project).So OK we have the Batmans and other good films this summer but for simple popcorn enjoyment, Iron Man holds its own. Don't look for a lot of soul searching (Stark's change of heart is more a plot device than a subject for exploration) but if you would solid action, some good laughs and a generally enjoyable product then this will fill that need till the next one comes along.","8/10"
"Iron Man","ohashmawi","5 January 2015","After watching this for the third time, I can't believe I had never realized how incredible this movie is. Iron Man is amazing, probably the second or third best superhero movie ever. It has great acting, incredible effects, great directing from Jon Favreau, and of course, freaking Jeff Bridges. The acting in Iron Man is really good, Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in this movie, after this movie, when you think Tony Stark, you'll think Robert Downey Jr., he really is Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as his assistant, Pepper, Terrence Howard does a very good job as Rhodey, I prefer Don Cheadle, but that's just a matter of opinion, they're both really good as Tony's best friend. And of course, the amazing Jeff Bridges is in this movie. That guy is really an incredible actor, he is great as Obadiah Stane, the only problem I had was that he's the bad guy of the movie, Jeff made a great villain, but I like him way better as a good guy. This guy is great, even as a power-hungry maniac, he's really awesome, obviously, because he's Jeff Bridges.The writing in the movie is very good, the characters were well written, the jokes are great, the movie's funny, witty, and action- packed. I really liked how they chose to play this origin story, I mean, half of the movie he's in captivity, the first time he flies is about 1 hour in the film, and that really worked.The special effects of the movie are really amazing, seriously, him suiting up in the Mark III for the first time was incredible, it gave me goosebumps. Everything is so cool here, the technology in the universe is awesome, but what I think is the coolest thing, is that it's actually believable. That's what makes this movie better than the others, in my opinion. Iron Man 2 and 3 have really ridiculous technology, it's very cool and all, but it makes no sense, Iron Man 2 has those unbelievable holograms, and Iron Man 3 has suits that assimilate on the user, and the Mark 42, which is attracted by microchips in Tony's body. So yeah, the technology of the movie is great because it doesn't seem far away from where we are right now. Also, it has a lot more Iron Man action than the others, and some of the coolest ones, I mean the Middle East parts where freaking amazing, when he said ""My turn"" and blasted the terrorists with his flamethrowers, that gave me goosebumps. The directing by Jon Favreau is great, he really made some exhilarating action, once again, the Middle East scenes were first-rate. But the final fight, wow, that was amazing too, Obadiah hitting Tony with a motorcycle, that was awesome. Also, the soundtrack is perfect, it goes incredibly well with the movie, ACDC with Iron Man, perfect combo.Iron Man is a great movie, in my opinion, it's what comic book movies should be, they need awesome action, good characters and acting and humor. The Dark Knight is great, and it doesn't have that last item, but in my opinion it's a great movie, not just a comic book movie, if you know what I mean, I don't think you did, but whatever. Watch this movie, it's awesome. I give it a 10/10.","10/10"

"Iron Man","Morejambo54","14 March 2021","This is still one of the best mcu films to date. Being the first movie in the mcu aloud the writers to take more risks with the plot unlike more recent movies that have followed the same formula. The beginning of the story hooks you in instantly and grabs your curiosity, then it leaps back and tells the beginnings of the invincible iron man. The time tony stark spends as a hostage is very necessary and works very well to change his perspective on many problems.Tony as a character is very strong and excellently played by Robert DJ. From watching the first iron man again it reminded me how much the character has developed throughout the mcu, he starts in this movie as a complete idiot who can be seen as the villain in some sense. The side characters are decent, they don't add a whole lot to the movie but do become increasingly more important. The villain is excellently played and is very intimidating, he isn't that well written into the story, but just enough that the twist shocks the watcher.The action is obviously great, and for a movie made in 2008 the cgi looks incredible minus a few shots...but it could stand out against movies made today. The humour is also pretty good, sometimes a bit misplaced but it does the job nicely. Overall a very fun movie that has influenced the creation of dozens of films to come.","9/10"
"Iron Man","mat-mcnaughton-254-33257","20 August 2012","There's something I like to call 'the Sherlock effect'. It basically says that Sherlock Holmes is a genius is is not allowed to be wrong ever. It's how they explain some (or most) of the things he does. It's quite a lazy way to go about the plot, but Robert Downey Jr. is such a phenomenal actor that I let it slide. And the same thing can be said about Tony Stark being everything all at once to everybody. No human could ever handle all that, but Tony Stark is more than human, and combine that with RDJr. to get the perfect person. Not perfect in that he has no flaws, but perfect in that you see past them and accept him for who he is, no matter what crazy things he does.All this talking can be summarized by me saying that RDJr. is brilliant and amazing in whatever he does and that this movie is completely worth it. I hope that many more are made.","10/10"
"Iron Man","Venomage03","29 May 2021","Robert Downey Jr. Does a fantastic job playing this character and making it his own.

"Iron Man","Tweekums","4 May 2011","At first glance Tony Stark isn't the sort of person you'd expect to become a superhero; he is a genius who has made his fortune inventing and selling state of the art weapons systems. At least he was until he is captured by insurgents in Afghanistan and learns that it isn't only the good guys who use his products. Once they have him the insurgents instruct him to make them a version of his latest weapon; instead he makes an armoured suit that renders him bullet proof and even enables him to fly. Using the suit he manages to escape and when he gets back to the United States he renounces the arms trade much to the consternation of this erstwhile partner. Tony now devotes his time to making a new improved version of the suit which he uses to protect the people that where being oppressed by his company's weapons. He isn't the only person with an armoured suit though; his partner Obadiah Stane is building one too and when it is completed he will attempt to destroy Tony.I found the earlier parts of this film to be the best; Robert Downey Jr. did a good job as Tony Stark making his damascene conversion from arms dealer to protector of the innocent believable at the end the story was just about two giant robots I mean men in power suits fighting; although I'm sure that is the scene younger members of the audience will enjoy most. Jeff Bridges also put in a good performance as bad guy Obadiah and Gwyneth Paltrow was fine as Tony's PA Pepper Potts. I was rather pleased that they managed to avoid the cliché of Tony and Pepper becoming a couple even if it was hinted that they might become one in the future. Unlike a lot of super heroes Tony Stark has no problem with killing his enemies and the weapons he uses may mean some parents might not thing this film is suitable for younger children.","1/10"
"Iron Man","blackburnj-1","16 November 2008","Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" fundamentally changed the superhero genre and became a gold standard. What it delivered was an often dark character piece with action to match and it was a blockbuster that art-house filmgoers could enjoy. When he came to direct ""Iron Man"", Jon Favreau had Nolan on his mind and has cited that film as a key inspiration. Favreau has not matched Nolan's achievement, but he has delivered a terrific piece of entertainment, which is not without depth and is superbly cast and well made.The central character of Tony Stark has to work if this film is to be at all successful, and he does, thanks to a snappy script and an absolutely excellent performance from Robert Downey Jr. Stark is similar to James Bond in one respect. You're happy to admire him as smooth and suave on screen, but know that, if he were an actual acquaintance of yours, you would probably loathe him. Despite his gambling, womanising, smug playboy nature, Stark is likable because Downey Jr. makes him unbelievably charming, funny and engaging. Added to this, Stark's character has an arc. Its progression doesn't span the whole film, and it isn't particularly original, but it does provide a point of connection with the character which makes Stark, and indeed Iron Man, a success.The pitch-perfect casting doesn't end there. Gwyneth Paltrow is far less annoying than she could have been and does make the ludicrously named Pepper Potts sympathetic. Terence Howard does a decent job with little to work with (his role is a place-holder for the inevitable sequel). However, the real star of the supporting cast is the ever-excellent Jeff Bridges, whose former-mentor Obadiah Stane is a treat to watch whenever his inversely-haired visage is on screen.The action is done very well. ILM's special effects are flawless and Favreau has a grip on the sequences which are thrilling and entertaining. The final sequence misses the mark a little but still has its moments. The rest of the film is humorous, entertaining and not a minute too long, which suggests that more time could have been spent on character.All-in-all, this film is a decent and entertaining set-up for what could be an interesting franchise. With this cast and the apparently safe hands behind the camera, we should be in for more superb entertainment in the inevitable sequel.4 Stars out of 5","1/10"
"Iron Man","GirishGowda","8 May 2010","Iron Man was coming on TV today and since me and my friends are going to 'Iron Man 2' sometime next week, I watched it to recall the characters and see if I still liked it like 2 years back. I am very happy to say that the second time I loved it even more. John Favreau directed this amazing movie which is one of the best superhero movies ever. I am keeping my fingers crossed, that Iron Man 2 will be a truly worthy successor to this amazing gem. Also, if anybody has a lifestory to tell, Downey Jr. has the ultimate comeback tale to tell. After all those stints in rehab and prison, he came back revamped in a new avatar and 2008 and 2009 were his years. He has become on of my favorite actors now.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is rich, handsome, intelligent, quick witted, incredibly wealthy and a playboy. He is the owner of Stark Industries which specializes in making warheads for the US military. He is kidnapped by an Afghanistan terrorist group who forces him to help them make his new, modern missiles. But Tony Stark, along with another Afghan scientist who is kidnapped, builds a suit of iron and escapes from their stronghold. Unfortunately the scientist is killed and he returns to his home. He has now seen that his weapons are in the hands of the bad guys and wants to stop the production of the warheads. But Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) advices him against this, because the consequences will be too great. Stane was his father's best friend and a business partner and he is now a major player in the Stark Industries and a close confidante of Tony Stark. Will Tony Stark make a difference in the world with his Iron Man? This is kind of a breath of fresh air to the superhero genre. It doesn't have all the baggages of other superheroes. Tony Stark is a man who enjoys life and he is a ladies man. I thought, what were they thinking by casting a middle aged man like Downey Jr, but that was before I saw the movie. After watching and being enthralled by the story, I accept that Downey was really born to play the role of Iron Man. The underplayed romance between Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Tony Stark works well for the story. Tony Stark changed his views about weapons after seeing what it did to other people who were in the line of fire. He wasn't a born justice upholder like other superheroes and he is a man behind all that metallic gear. This is what makes Iron Man so much more endearing. If the character of Obadiah Stane was played by any other actor other than Jeff Bridges, it would have been simply awful. I didn't even know who Jeff was before this year's Oscar, but I still remember hating his evil persona character back when it released. Terrence Howard plays Stark's best friend Rhodey, who is an officer in the US military and his character is under written. But, I thought he would get a chance to display his acting in the second movie, but they have put some other man in his part and it is so sad that he won't be a part of Iron Man 2. The banter of Stark with his robotic assistants, the freezing of the Iron Man suit and everything except the final battle is brilliant. The final battle is supposed to be like that, so I can't hate Favreau for that.The background score is awesome and the cgi effects seemed insanely real. Iron Man 2 released here yesterday (so sad its releasing late here) and I hope it will be awesome :) 9/10","6/10"
"Iron Man","utku_kamil_ozen","23 February 2017","Before i start my review, i'd like to note that it's impossible to criticize this film without putting the ''comic book googles'' on. Because it's such a mess in terms of reality, even for a sci-fi film. I mean, even if you could come up with an indestructible material for your armor, it won't save you anyway when you hit the ground at 200 mph, g force will kill you no matter what kind of armor you wear. And the character wasn't established as a super human, he's flesh and bone. So, the technical premise of the film is very weak and b movie level, made me laugh so many times. But as i said, i'll put the comic book googles on and ignore the ridiculously nonsensical technical side of the film. Because the film is not about that.The first thing that has bothered me, aside from the above-mentioned issue, was the starting point of the character arc. We were supposed to dislike Tony Stark a little bit at the start. Because he comes off as an arrogant, war profiteering, misogynistic, cynical hedonist at the start. But the film failed to reflect him as such. And instead Tony Stark was portrayed as a very likable, rockstar-like character - despite all his negative qualities shown- from the very beginning of the film. In fact, i believe most common audiences(especially American, no offence) didn't see anything wrong with Stark's character by the way it was delivered. But maybe the director was trying to be subtle in the way he delivered his negative sides. Nevertheless, i think it failed there. For me, the most enjoyable part of the film came after this failed character introduction; the escape from the death cave. I could have enjoyed a film solely based on this escape alone. I loved the idea of him making the robot-armor under such difficult conditions, out of different equipment, while being monitored by the terrorists, and i loved that crude armor mark 1. Following that, came the most disappointing part, where he rocketed into the sky with the crude, bulky armor. This was the turning point of the technical side(which i was enjoying up until that point) of the film. Generally, humor was done very well and Robert Downey Jr. did a great job with the character. And this is the main reason why these Iron Man and Avengers films are so successful. Another positive thing was the love interest part. I liked how they had a history together and how they took it slow, it felt real. Because in such films, most often, the character meets the love interest during the story of the film and then they fall in ''love'' even though they know nothing about each other and they are ready to die for one another(stupid thor). So it didn't do that. The villain was too comic booky(wink wink), and i wish they had done more with Jeff Bridges, he's such an interesting actor.In conclusion, i had fun watching this, despite all the negative things that bothered me. Robert Downey Jr. carried this very well and made it a memorable, fun film.","10/10"
"Iron Man","alexkolokotronis","28 January 2009","Iron Man was not the revolutionary movie comic book movie people were claiming it to be. In fact it was a rather disappointing film. I thought it was corny and even more backwards for the state of comic book movies than anything else.The acting was good when it came to Robert Downey Jr. He was the only reason I had any respect for this film at all. It lifted the movie up from garbage to mediocrity. Terrence Howard who I am not fan of was very annoying to me and Jeff Bridges was about as under utilized with his abilities as he has ever been.The directing was below average in that the action seems were un-satisfying and the film failed to engross me whatsoever. I tried very hard to get involved in the movie but the movie just felt like it was dragging on and it only got worse. The conclusion was bad and the supposed great writing was non-existent in my mind. The effects were very good but I was not put into awe by them.I obviously did not enjoy this film but if you are a die hard comic book fan you probably will enjoy this. If you are a movie fan though and are looking for something different in a comic book movie watch The Dark Knight not Iron Man.","7/10"
"Iron Man","Jay_Exiomo","29 April 2008","The summer blockbuster season has indeed come and ""Iron Man"" is a fine film that provides a solid diversion through the course of its running time - at least for the first hour. But it's always good to see Robert Downey Jr. and it goes without saying that, despite equally impressive performances from the supporting cast, he owns this movie.Based from yet another Marvel comic book superhero, Downey is Tony Stark, a genius billionaire industrialist who has amassed his great fortune by developing weapons for the US military. On a trip to Afghanistan he is captured by terrorists, is held hostage and forced to build a weapon for his captors. He instead secretly builds a power armor that would help him escape and keep him alive from a shrapnel that has been embedded in his heart.He escapes and upon his return to America, he develops a more advanced suit, giving him superhuman strength, capable of flying and firing missiles among others, whereupon he is dubbed as the Iron Man.While the movie begins interestingly with glimpses of Stark's confused character, it stalls during the second part where the uncreative riffs of an origin movie seems like obligatory parts director Jon Favreau and the screenwriters are too eager to be done with. Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's PA Pepper Potts is charming, but Paltrow doesn't exactly have chemistry with Stark. Terrence Howard as Stark's best bud Jim Rhodes is slightly underused and one wishes there would be more of him in case a few more sequels are underway.As for the obligatory villain, a bald and bearded Jeff Bridges effectively plays an otherwise drab villain on Stark's teacher and business partner Obadiah Stane. There's no depth in his character and he's about as cartoonish as a villain can get, so to speak. The climactic battle between him and Iron Man isn't that exciting either.Retconned to modern times, it's not just about some teenager with personal vendetta to deal with; it's about a man riddled with guilt and a global issue to deal with. It's just disappointing that Favreau would bypass Stark's conflicts for the obvious and less trappings of a summer blockbuster.Still for the most part, the movie's entertaining. There's some great CGI, some humor all around - mostly from Downey - and a couple of action sequences that are better handled than the climactic one. Plus it's pretty easy to cheer for the hero even if for most of the time he's battling enemies who have no chance of winning.So while ""Iron Man"" isn't a lock on achieving an A-list status in terms of superhero movies, it gets its job done and leaves one hoping it earns enough at the box office so we'll get to see more of Downey as the eponymous superhero, and crossing our fingers it will be better now the conventional part's done with.","1/10"

Iron-Man is still and will always be one of the best hero's out there hands down.","3/10"
"Iron Man","SeptumSin","30 November 2008","Man! I don't believe it's too overrated but still...OK we start the movie with Tony Stark, a multimillionaire playboy, alcoholic, weapon making genius. He's not carrying what happens until something comes about that changes his mind and makes him make a super suite to combat world terror. Thus Iron Man was born.This is yet another great action film with predictable plot and a big fight at the end. Comic book fans will like this movie as it is fairly accurate to the story of Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent with the part of Tony Stark I doubt it could have been played better. The only downer of this movie is the fact that it's still just another blockbuster with predictable plot but I'm fine for more of the same but it won't get above an 8 no matter how cool it looks or is acted out.","5/10"
"Iron Man","michaelRokeefe","3 May 2008","Iron Man is based on the fictional Marvel Comics character Iron Man. You say that Robert Downey Jr is just not the super hero type...get over it. He plays Tony Stark the billionaire industrialist, who manufactures superior weapons of war. Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan with the promise of freedom if he builds a highly destructive missile for them. Instead he builds a suit of armor to make his escape. Stark realizes that many of his weapons are being used to kill Americans in combat. He holds a press conference expounding his manufacturing empire will quit the production of weapons. He puts a lot of effort in perfecting his armored suit to turn himself into the highly technological hero Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his faithful personal assistant Pepper Potts. Terrence Howard is his jet pilot friend James Rhodes. And his mentor and business partner Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges) is the essence of evil covertly ordering a hit to kill Stark and take over his empire. Also in the cast: Faran Tahir, Sayed Badreya, Shaun Toub and the gorgeous Leslie Bibb. FX and CGI are commanding and superb. You really get the bang for your buck. The film's stars have already signed on to do two sequels.","8/10"
"Iron Man","kieranbattams","24 April 2015","Anyone remember the days when Marvel studios wasn't a mammoth technical market and didn't feature Norse gods and talking raccoons? I figured that because i am finally going to see my most anticipated film ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" tonight i would revisit the very start of the Marvel cinematic Universe and get to know Tony Stark all over again. This film really stood out to me back in 2008 as one of the best films i'd seen, not just in the superhero genre but in general. To this day the film still stands out to me as the best standalone film and the perfect way to start the universe we have all grown to love. Iron Man was very much more grounded in reality, i mean sure none of the things that Stark creates and uses can be replicated, but at the time going from this to Thor seemed like it wasn't possible. Oh, how times change.The plot follows Tony Stark, who as you all know by now is played with absolute perfection and flawlessness (is that a word) by the very talented Robert Downey Jr. He is given an electromagnet to prevent shrapnel from entering his heart and killing him from what was an explosion by his own company's weapon. Instead of building a missile that terrorists demand from him Tony builds an arc reactor and a suit of armour that he uses to get his own back. This causes Stark to order all weapons stop being made and he develops a high-tech suit to use and becomes the hero we all love, Iron Man. Jeff Bridges is also very good and uses an accent that isn't Texan cowboy with throat cancer as Obadiah Stane (Iron Monger) who has his own plans for Stark Industries and the final showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger gives us what is one of the most spectacular from phase one. Marvel has never had a strong point for villains, Ronan from Guardians of the Galaxy is a prime example. But when they get a villain right they get it very right! (Think Loki) and Obadiah Stane in this movie is one of the best the MCU has to offer.Watching Gwyneth Paltrow in this movie felt weird too. She was very much just Tony's assistant and acted a lot differently to the way she does in say, Iron Man 3. This is some really good development for her character and she of course does a great job as Pepper Potts. We also have Terrence Howard as James Rhodes which looking at it now felt out of place since we have all gotten used to Don Cheadele. This isn't to say he did a bad job, in fact he did a very good job but it would be nice to know why he didn't appear in any subsequent films after this. A particular scene featured Rhodes looking at Tony's Mark II suit (War Machine prototype) and saying ""next time, baby"". Sorry Terrence, not next time.In the end Iron Man is absolutely the best way to kick off a universe of characters and he will always be the Avenger that sticks with me as a result of this movie. Downey Jr. Made the character his very own and i cannot imagine another actor taking his place. Robert is Iron Man and is the best casting since Hugh Jackman as WolverineI give Iron Man a perfect rating as it is a film that i have grown to love more since i first saw it and it will be a part of my collection until the very end. Definitely check it out if you haven't already. Plus we got our first scenes with Coulson and our first post-credits scene which is still the best one today. All this and more, it not only stands as one of my favourite superhero movies but one of the best of all time. I will be reviewing Tony Stark's latest adventure with Avengers Age of Ultron tonight so stay tuned for that! And yes.. i am so excited that if i wait any longer i will self destruct.","9/10"
"Iron Man","kosmasp","12 August 2008","I have to state, that I'm not an avid comic(graphic novel) book reader, so I can't point out any differences between the written (or drawn) world and the real (filmed) world. But I know that this movie was a lot of fun and it seems to owe many things to Batman Begins ... beginning with an ensemble cast!But the main actor here is of course Robert Downey Jr. If you have followed his career & private life (some ups, unfortunately many ""downs"" too, no pun intended), you have to be real happy seeing him getting recognized for his talent and finally beginning to explore his (acting) abilities and being confident enough to play major roles. This is apparent through the screen/his acting. He is very comfortable (not only because of the ""support"" cast, that ... supports him, Terence Howard, Gwyneth P. and Jeff B.) and this helps elevate the movie! It is fun & light, but with an honest message/warning (just like Mr. Downey himself)","9/10"
"Iron Man","liberalgems","6 May 2008","I have to admit, I fell for all the hype that this was going to be a enjoyable film. The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure! One of the problems with Iron Man is that it's geared towards the mind of a child/young teen without any charm. It's so incredibly predictable, a sort of comic-book-story-formula-film. A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story. - I'm tired of the meanie terrorist villains. I'm tired of the totally clueless good guy(s). I'm tired of the evil mentor! This story has absolutely zero imagination. It's at the intelligence level of a second-rate, Saturday morning cartoon! It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable! The really bad guys have alway got to be Arabs, or look like Arabs. They kill innocent civilians for no reason. They hide in caves, like the hated Japanese soldiers did in World War 2. But only a rich and powerful U.S. weapons inventor & dealer can come to the rescue! Wow! What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world! Who would ever of guessed that deep, down, inside, some of the Merchants of Death literally have a heart of gold (or palladium, in this case)! Afghanistan is currently an extremely troubled country even though it has a very rich cultural tradition. It's a shame it was dumbed down in Iron Man to helpless civilians, brutal warlords, an impotent and clueless U.S. military and one white man who had a very unconvincing conversion experience. If Hollywood is going to bring politics and current events into a comic book story then they need act more like mature adults, instead of soulless moneygrubers trying to make a quick buck off of the horrific suffering of people in some distant land. Afghanistan is not some make believe place! It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday! I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots. And, while I'm at it, it would be nice if some of the many millions of dollars Hollywood is going to make from Iron Man is donated to various third-party, non-profit organizations working on reconstructing Afghanistan's civilian infrastructure! They certainly could use the money!","5/10"
"Iron Man","alansmithee04","14 November 2008","Featuring the very latest in computer generated effects and a plot that would insult a retarded six year old, Ironman is the latest in a long line of Hollywood product culled from the dizzying literary heights of superhero comic books.Product this disposable doesn't happen by accident. Teams of industry product makers work around the clock for years to make something this tasteless, tedious and utterly bland. Don't even try to characterize this product as a ""movie."" It simply isn't.If Ironman was edible, it would be a jar of baby food. Library paste flavored baby food. If it were music, it would be chopsticks. If it were a vehicle, it would be a tricycle. A tricycle with training wheels. If it were...What? Oh yeah, the product. It's something about the usual gazillionaire playboy who flies around in a sooper-dooper extra-gadgety metal suit and frees Afghanistan from the Evil Brown People, making the country safe for, I dunno, oil companies I guess. The plot is such a pile of moronic sub-juvenile drivel it's impossible to focus on for more than a few minutes before being distracted by something more interesting like, say, the butter-flavored grease stains on the bottom of your popcorn bag.Contempt for it's audience drips from every frame of this product. No doubt the droolcase fanboy target audience will be thrilled to down to their Batman Under-Roos by Downey's lackluster performance as he sleepwalks through the product's repulsive hero role. The product is certainly simple enough for people who regard Cheetos as food group and think repetitively boring video games are the apex of computer technology.But aside from it's pimply focus group, the only other audiences to which this product could possibly appeal would be coma patients and Scientologists. And you'd probably have to tie down the coma patients.","10/10"
"Iron Man","davidmvining","25 November 2019","I know what Tony Stark's character arc is supposed to be in this movie. I do not know what it actually is, though.Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer who works on contracts from the United States government. He starts the movie finishing a large sale for a new missile called the Jericho. It produces its large explosions, the military is happy, and Tony makes his sale. His convoy is quickly beset by terrorist forces, Stark is captured, and the terrorists force him to produce a Jericho missile for them in a cave with some leftover Stark weapons they have sitting around. The idea that they have the right materials for a new weapon system from older weapons is a bit ridiculous, but it's probably not quite as ridiculous as the idea that these same weapons have the parts to create a state of the art, miniature, perpetual source of energy that fits into a slot in Tony's chest. But hey, it's a techno-fantasy. Let's just roll with it.Tony produces a suit of armor instead because his captors are idiots who can't tell the difference between a chest plate and a missile casing. With the help of a kindly local doctor who speaks every language the plot requires of him, Tony escapes. It helps that the doctor has the perfect mix of wanting to live long enough to help Tony and wanting to die to join his family in death so he throws his life away to help Tony escape.Tony returns home where he immediately holds a press conference and declares that Stark Industries will never produce weapons again. Everyone freaks out, but then everyone forgets about it about twenty minutes later when Tony just never shows up to work in order to ensure that his radical orders get carried out. Instead, he stays in his mansion over a cliff looking out at the ocean and plays with his toys. That is, he upgrades his cave suit for the 21st century and gives himself a new miraculous source of eternal energy for his chest (ordering the old one, which could conceivably power a house for some time, to be thrown out).Okay, so let's take a step back and try to figure out what Tony's arc is. He starts the movie as a playboy arms dealer. He gets captured and realizes that his weapons are being sold to terrorists. He gets home and starts the process (without ever following up) to end all weapons manufacture in his company. He then proceeds to build his own weapon in the form of a high-tech suit which he then uses to kill a bunch of people, protecting some family we've never met before. So, what's the arc? He almost grows and then doesn't? He starts as a playboy and ends as a...murderous playboy? Yeah, he protects people, so I guess that's it, using his tools for good instead of just not paying attention to who uses them. It's confused and thin.Oh, and let's get to the antagonist of the film, Obadiah Stane. Stane makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are really two parts to his villainy, so let's take it one at a time. The first part occurs before the action of the movie. He arranges for Tony to be kidnapped and murdered by the terrorists before Tony ever leaves. Why? The closest we get is that Tony doesn't take the business side of things seriously. He doesn't show up to an awards ceremony. I mean, I guess that's good enough reason to murder the CEO and lifelong friend. The second part of the characters villainy occurs after Tony returns from the caves. Obviously, Stane isn't going to like the idea of Stark shutting down a major division of the company, but he actually ends up ensuring that the steps Tony wants to happen never happen. There's a shock to the system (highlighted by talk of the company's stock price dropping), but once Tony's in his little lab working (for supposedly weeks), things seem to be going on as normal at Stark Industries. So, of course Stane recreates Tony's original suit in a larger form and goes on a kill crazy rampage which only Tony can stop.Stane has bugged me since I first saw this movie in 2008, and I just can't shake the fact that there must be at least ten minutes of deleted scenes explaining a lot of this. But whether they're on a home video release as extras or not, all that matters is what's in the movie itself, and the movie chose to make Stane completely nonsensical (probably for ""pacing"" reasons).Alright, I've ragged on this movie enough. I'm far from hating it. The action is good. Robert Downey Jr. is fun as Stark and carries most of the movie despite my problems with Tony's arc. It looks good in a clean and straightforward sort of way. The music is functionally complimentary to the action on screen. If you ignore the fact that none of the characters do anything that makes a lick of sense, it's actually fairly entertaining when it's not being overly serious. I remember liking this movie a whole lot more in 2008 than now, though I never loved it like many people do. Eleven years later, rewatching it for the first time in about a decade, I have to say that I was actually really disappointed in it overall.","10/10"
"Iron Man","movieman_kev","9 May 2008","The latest superhero based film that comes down the pipeline is Iron Man,telling the origin of how billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) becomes Iron Man while captured by the enemy during wartime (updating the story, substituting the Koreans for the Taliban for obvious reasons) Casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was a stroke of genius given his highly public past escapades, and after seeing him as the hard-drinking, womanizing, wealthy industrialist turned superhero Iron Man by sheer necessity one would be hard pressed to view an other actor portraying him. Downey IS Stark and this is a primary reason why the movie works so well (there's a scene late in the movie where he has a scene that mirrors ""Less Then Zero"", in look more than subject matter, that I quite enjoyed, but won't spoil here). Jeff Bridges holds his own very well as Obadiah Stane, Tony's main foil, but there's no stealing the spotlight from Robert in the least. This is fully his film.However even with the immaculate casting, the film only would be as good as it's storyline, fortunately here too it excels, remaining highly compelling and vastly entertaining (for the most part, of course a scene or two could've been trimmed a tad to tighten things up, it still works though). The direction by Jon Favreau is great as well and remarkably solid (even if the same can't of his role as Happy Hogan) All in all, this is the first great blockbuster of 2008 and will likely remain the best until the new Indiana Jones comes out. It already, without a doubt, ranks up with the best Super-hero movies made thus far.PS. Make sure to stay until after the credits for a nifty surpriseMy Grade: A-","8/10"

"Iron Man","Strider_1978","22 May 2008","I might be the wrong audience for this film and I don't want to pull it down without fairly good reasoning.I can suspend disbelief to a degree.

"Iron Man","andrewnmiller","9 February 2015","Having never read the Iron Man comics as a kid and having never seen this film when it first came out in '08, I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch it. Would it be dark and complex, overly campy or a fun action romp? Well, I can say Iron Man totally blew me away from its action and visual effects to its acting and writing. After watching this, it's hard to imagine what the MCU would have been without this movie.We start off in the deserts of Afghanistan where a military convoy is escorting millionaire playboy Tony Stark to show off his new ""Jericho"" missile. The convoy is then attacked and Tony is significantly wounded by one of his own weapons. Tony is then captured and imprisoned by a terrorist organization called the Ten Rings. Stark discovers that an electromagnet has been embedded into his chest to prevent shrapnel from reaching his heart and killing him. The Ten Rings Leader Raza then offers Tony his freedom in return for Tony building a Jericho missile for the group, but Stark has no intention of keeping his word. With the help of fellow inmate, Yinsen, Tony builds an arc reactor to charge the electromagnet and a suit of armor. Following his escape from the cave and returning home, Stark shows up at a press meeting and announces that his company will no longer make weapons after what he witnessed earlier in the film. He also builds an enhanced version of the suit plus a new arc reactor. Now, Tony must fight his inner demons as well as putting his talents to making the world better.While superhero films have become an everyday factor in the summer blockbuster season, one question always comes up: how does one make a comic book film stand out in the middle of so much superhero completion while remaining faithful to the comics? It seems John Favreau has that covered. Right from the opening chords of ""Back in Black"" it becomes obvious that Iron Man is a different kind of superhero movie. Rather than go the Christopher Nolan route by making the movie as darker and grittier than its source material ever needed to be, Favreau isn't afraid to welcome a much needed sense of fun without diverting into outright silliness. In the process, Iron Man essays an outstanding balance between welcoming every entertaining element while preserving the seriousness and difficulty of the origin story and the characters. Also by modernizing Tony's backstory from Vietnam to Afghanistan, the movie adds a touch of political tragedy, making a few tongue in cheek remarks about the US military in the process.The script is one of the things that really sell this film, with a string of intelligently written lines, a far cry from some of the more overused Hollywood writing that could've been thought by your ordinary six year old. Robert Altman's influence on the script leads to several humorous ad-libbing on top of the written material.Favreau doesn't hold back when it comes to the action and the visual effects, resulting in some enthralling action set pieces such as a fight in an Afghan village and a final show down between Iron Man and Iron Monger, not to mention some truly edgy scenes as well as the adrenaline pumping scene of Stark testing his Mark 1 armor during his escape. The special effects are flawless and are carried out perfectly without overwhelming the movie's overall story. Iron Man's armor looks stunning, a clinking mass of machinery that come together with a heart beating exterior. The same can also be said for the musical score which delivers some aptly heroic themes.Of course, this movie wouldn't be half the movie it is without its cast and what a cast: Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly believable as Pepper Potts, her charm and cool comebacks easily being an excellent foil to Tony's livewire performance and brings some serious-minded glow of sexual tightness and interaction between her and Tony. Jeff Bridges molds his normal laid-back look into a wickedly conniving businessperson hiding his self-centered dealings under a façade of decency and while it was interesting to see Bridges play a villain, he did a great job, Terrence Howard provides an appropriately brisk aroma of self-respect as Tony's friend, James Rhodes, enhancing his performance with just the perfect amount of deadpan delivery, but the real star here is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. I can't praise his performance enough as he is the key element to making Iron Man stand out amongst other comic book films. Easily the best performance in his career, Downey fluently makes every single inch of Tony his own and puts an unconventional spin on the character through his wisecracking, smart mouthed dynamism while still staying true to Stark's character, even making the shift from an arrogant playboy to a humanitarian wearing an iron suit possible through his personality and his shining, zealous strength. There are some obvious parallels between Tony and RDJ's personal lives when it comes to the excess and women. Downey plays a bit of a double-faced role here as Stark and Iron Man, on one hand being his lavish self whose duty is the maintenance of his father's company vs his own mission to become a better person. The dialog given to Robert in every scene is full of one-liners finished in quick time. To say that RDJ was born to play this role is an understatement; he is and will always be Iron Man. Even Samuel Jackson has a brief appearance as S.H.I.E.L.D agent, Nick Fury who sets the scene for later events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Iron Man is a perfect superhero movie. I really don't have any issues with it, it just rocks all around. So do yourselves a favor and give this film a watch, you'll enjoy it.","8/10"
"Iron Man","McGrit","28 April 2008","This first big popcorn movie of the year is also the best summer movie since Spider-Man 2.What I liked is that there's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The playboy, hard-drinking, fast-talking arms merchant goes to Afghanistan to show the military Stark Industries' cool new toy. Events unfold and he sees, first hand, what his ordnance and his creations do to real people.The movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting. Downey brings not only his real life baggage and winning personality to play as Stark; he finds his pathos, too. Jeff Bridges certainly has the acting chops to hang with Downey and is the perfect foil and perfect villain because this is no mustache twirling, one dimensional character. Terrence Howard is perfect as the military man and old college buddy. Gwyneth Paltrow's character adds to the casting perfection. She's every bit the wise yet sexy assistant whose a match for her womanizing boss. The interaction and the relationships all work well and is even one one the highlights of the entire movie itself. Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, Iron Man's creators mix everything so well. It leans away from dark but touches on it just enough. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they had Downey's talents to play with but Downey's performance leads to more clever banter and genuinely real dialogue than most comic-book movies have ever delivered. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Downey's Stark is glib and even obnoxious at times but he never loses his likability and grows in to something more. That's true character establishment and development in a comic book film, people. Even the flirtation between Stark and his assistant has the undertow of lonely romantic longing and implications. What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that every death carries real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix great acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. Oh yeah, did I mention that Iron Man kicks butt and is loads of fun too? That you could tell from the flood of action clips seen leading up to the movie. The CG is perfect and the action is intense and very well done. That's no shocker. What was a pleasant surprise was that Iron Man is a complete movie.(PS- It also includes the funniest Stan Lee cameo he's ever done)","8/10"

Updated from its comic book beginnings to our present century of world terror I M villains are the usual suspects of semi-literate hateful Afghans and greedy American capitalists strikingly familiar to the same difficult types encountered by Super,Spider and Bat mans.Tony Stark, brilliant inventor and mega rich arms dealer goes through a moral conversion after being wounded and captured by Afghan terrorists. Managing to build an armor plated flying suit under the eyes of his moronic captors he escapes to fight another day, this time in a really neat looking metallic model. When Tony wants to do a one eighty with the business his evil partner attempts to thwart him. Who shall win this titanic struggle of good and evil? Who cares. We're here to be visually mesmerized and that we are but only for brief periods and with the same twists and turns crashes and explosions that every mega budgeted fiction fantasy flic offers.Robert Downey Jr. as the I Man is a brilliant piece of marketing in art imitating life. The one time drug sodden loser like the comic book character has managed to rise Phoenix like from the ashes of a ruined career and parlay it into what looks to be a mega money maker for the next decade. Downey is the right choice but hardly tested as an actor since a super hero's emotional range is very limited (it's the reason villains are so much more interesting)but he does manage to bring a cool hipness to the square super hero model. Jeff Bridges overacts a tad with an evil Daddy Warbucks impression and Gwyneth Paltrow as suffering girl Friday Pepper Potts seems to be in the downward spiral Downey was with the culprit not being drugs but lack of talent.The special effects are predictably spectacular and there's a heavy metal music score to bludgeon you along the way as the assembly line plot unfolds with less grace than the first Spiderman and even less humor and suspense than Robo-Cop. You seen one you seen 'em all. This is a newer but not improved hybrid model of a crowded field and it is more tin than iron.","6/10"
"Iron Man","Benedict_Cumberbatch","8 May 2008","I went to see ""Iron Man"" knowing nothing about the character (never read the comic books) and without great expectations. I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan and if not for his presence, I probably would've ignored it. I didn't like it as much as most people, but it was fairly entertaining (and that's what I was expecting after all, we're not talking about groundbreaking film-making here and I don't think anybody expects that from this, right?) and that's mostly thanks to Downey Jr., one of the coolest actors out there, a chameleon who can play pretty much everything. Adding to the ""cool"" aspect of the movie, Jeff Bridges plays the villain. I'm glad that the long, dark phase of drug abuse Downey Jr. was living some years ago is over, and the man is alive and kicking to continue delighting audiences. Plus, ""Iron Man"" will introduce him to a whole new generation. Don't expect much and enjoy the ride; better a summer flick with Robert Downey Jr. than a dozen Michael Bays starring bland new ""stars"" and tanned Angelina Jolie wannabes. 7/10.","6/10"
"Iron Man","jordiojoystar","31 January 2014","Iron Man is a good start for new fanbase and existing fans, it tells a little history on how he eventually took the responsibility to become Iron Man. Barely alive and escaping from terrorist group is not one could think about it, what's more building an armor suit to fly from the terrorist hideout and to be saved once more.In Marvel Comics, Tony Stark was also saved by Dr. Yinsen but set during the Vietnam War instead in Afghanistan (prior to Afghan war-torn).There are many changes in comparison with the comics and movie. Movie tries to make things as interesting as possible for the new and unknown audience.Comic geeks like myself would have to conclude that this is the Iron Man we all knew but in the different era and technology.But I'm pretty much amazed how Favreau managed to make the suit alive.","9/10"
"Iron Man","ayushman98","31 December 2014","A great kick-start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe full of awesome action, awesome visuals and awesome characters. This is one movie that cuts to the chase in a manner that can entertain comic and non comic fans alike. Moreover, Obadiah Stane finds the fact that Tony gives the world its best weapon ever by trying to rid it of weapons really ironic. Well that isn't all that meets the eye, trying to order a hit to have Tony killed leads to Obadiah building a hero out of him, which is even more ironic and awesome at the same time. Heroes aren't born, they're built. Moreover, what this movie did different was that it skipped the origin story and started with the important part. Director Jon Favreau and actor Robert Downey Jr put in their best to satisfy the audience in this action packed, must watch comic book movie.","8/10"

"Iron Man","bkoganbing","19 May 2008","From what I can see of Iron Man, he's different from other superheroes in two respects. First he's quite the vulnerable one and second he's put together with extreme, but very human intelligence. Nobody came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond mortal men. No one got their DNA mixed up with some animal to give them some extra-sapien traits. No Iron Man is put together in a laboratory after a prototype is done while in captivity in a cave.That's probably both the strength and weakness of this film. Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and most of all Jeff Bridges look like they're having a great old time putting flesh and bone on comic strip characters. I'm glad they enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do these kind of films.Iron Man is updated to today's world situation, but with some Thirties flashbacks because it's an arms dealer who is the chief villain here. Downey is like Bruce Wayne, a multimillionaire heir to an armaments fortune who likes to have a good time as well as work while Bridges minds the company day to day. But that MIT education did not go for naught as those Afghan terrorists found out. Downey proves as resourceful as B.A. Baracus of the A-Team in developing the Iron Man first to escape captors and then to defeat bad guys. And these bad guys are quite in league.But while the special effects are nice and the players are having a good time, Iron Man reminded me of a Popeye cartoon. Downey and Bridges looked Popeye and Bluto in the best two out of three falls. All that Downey needed to do was reach for that can of Spinach.I half expected he would.","9/10"

I am also one of those people that prefers Terrance Howard as War Machine but thats just cause he is a great actor. This movie is a good mix at feeling like a super hero movie set in modern times, where some of the others just get to fantasy or sci fi heavy to feel relatable.

"Iron Man","jjgooner","1 July 2013","Iron Man***1/2 (out of 4)120 mins/ 12Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Gwenyth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Paul Bettany, Jon Favreau, Clark Gregg, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir, Leslie Bibb, Bill SmitrovichDirector: Jon FavreauPlot: After weapons dealer, Tony Stark, is forced to build an iron suit to save his life, he decides to use it to fight back against evil powers.JJ's Verdict: Iron Man is probably the coolest film to grace our screens since Oceans Eleven did in 2001. Iron Man introduces us to charming, playboy, billionaire, and tech-genius; Tony Stark. He is irresponsible and forgetful and would rather spend his time flirting with ladies in casino's than working or receiving a world peace award at a up-town dinner event. However, while showcasing his new weapons, he is captured by Arab terrorists and forced to build an iron-plated suit to help him escape his captures. This makes him more responsible and wary of the world, which leads him to becoming 'Iron Man'. Robert Downey Jr. plays his role so cool and carefree that you almost feel his is playing himself. This isn't a bad thing though as this is an inspired piece of casting from Marvel as the script seemed to almost fit RDJ's blueprint. Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Stark's loyal assistant Pepper Potts, not only puts in a great performance, but has brilliant, buzzing chemistry with her Downey Jr. Terrence Howard makes a decent buddy to Stark and Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, although a predictable character, is good as the demanding foster-father to Tony. Also in the cast are relative unknowns Shaun Toub and Clark Gregg who might have just become overnight stars. Toub plays Yinsen, a doctor who aids Stark in his building of the suit, and Gregg, who plays S.H.I.E.L.D agent Phil Coulson.The film itself is actually very good. The film mixes humour with action to great effect. The technology and effects created are marvellous. From the construction of the suit, to the software at Tony's 'bachelor pad' and the dazzling action sequences. The suit itself is well designed and has uses its many functions brilliantly – and thats just the prototype. The music syncs well with the fun action scenes and is in especially good use when Stark flies through t he night sky to the backdrop of L.A. Jon Favreau (also playing Stark's bodyguard) directs this very well considering all his previous directing efforts have been comedies. Although, while trying to be realistic, gets too far-fetched and the film's pacing is poor; Iron Man is one of the best entertainments you'll get in a long time! And also watch out for a brilliant, well worth the watch, post-credits scene with the world's smoothest actor (of course lining it up for a sequel).","8/10"

"Iron Man","moutonbear25","4 May 2008","What is Iron Man anyway? Can we really call him a superhero? As far as I can tell, he's just a guy with a bum heart that happens to be pretty handy in the shop. His superhero development falls more in line with Batman's as neither necessarily has any special power (Wait, my bat-sense is tingling?) but rather relies on strength and gadgetry to get the job done. Even Batman has the dark history to fuel his passion though. What does Iron Man have? His day job is as an arms manufacturing tycoon named Tony Stark. He's got all the money in the world, women throwing themselves at him and the worst part is, he inherited everything from his dad. This silver spoon baby has been set his whole life and now he gets to be admired and adored as a superhero too? Ordinarily, I would give in to my jealousy and scoff at this supposed superhero but Robert Downey Jr., under the fresh direction of Jon Favreau, just makes him too damn cool for me to do anything other than love him.Aside from all this, Iron Man is also hilarious. Make no mistake; he most certainly gets himself into a number of perilous scenarios but he also manages to find something to laugh at no matter how dire the circumstances. While the original comic book found Stark in some life threatening Vietnam war situation (I am not a comic book junkie so I'm afraid I can't get more specific than that), Favreau wanted today's Iron Man to have a contemporary back story and what could be more appropriate than Stark being held prisoner in Osama Bin Laden's former hood, the mountains of Afghanistan. At first, it feels all too easy to place Arab militants as the face of the bad guys but the film vindicates its initial racial vilifying by exposing Stark himself (and therefore, America) as the supplier of these terrorists' entire arsenal. It is Stark's realization that he truly is one of the great mass murderers in American history that wakes him from his comfortable, privileged existence to a new dawn of using his position for positive change. After all, a weapon is only truly a weapon when it is in the wrong hands.IRON MAN is not without its clichés. Stark suffers injuries in the Middle East that requires him to have some form of electro-magnetic contraption lodged in his chest so that little bits of shrapnel don't seep into his blood stream and eventually cut up the arteries in his heart. So what if the ultimate playboy/loner now needs help to sustain a healthy heartbeat when he has walked around for so long acting like he never had a heart in the first place. So what if the man who has everything doesn't truly have anything of real value. These kinds of truisms are the foundation of comic book characters; what genuinely matters is how the men are portrayed and Downey Jr. was born to play to Tony Stark. After rising to critical fame with films like CHAPLIN, personal problems with drug abuse led Downey to years of type casting as characters with drug problems in films like WONDER BOYS and THE SCANNER DARKLY. With IRON MAN, it looks like he might finally be able to wipe his past clean and achieve the heights his talent has always warranted. Though his body is in noticeably better shape, it is his quick-witted delivery and cynical yet sympathetic duality that make Tony Stark the kind of guy everyone wants to hang out with or just plain be. So, what is Iron Man anyway? Well, according to this adaptation, he is the superhero for the modern era. He is sarcastic and skeptical but still hopeful and genuine with those he is close with (most notably, his perfectly matched assistant Pepper Potts, played just as delectably by Gwyneth Paltrow). He is a man who is capable of admitting his failures, not dwelling on them and then fostering a new path for himself. He is the kind of man that is both envied and looked up to. He is building himself a reputation as a superhero that can manage tremendous feats through intelligence and perseverance rather than just brawn and dumb luck. And now, IRON MAN is also a movie that offers perspective on the world around us at the same time as some awesome exhilaration.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Howlin Wolf","9 May 2008","These morally compromised times all but demand that a morally compromised anti-hero be allowed to stand at their centre, and there are moments when an audience member is left to reflect that the alter-ego Tony Stark could almost have been specifically created for Robert Downey, Jr. He brings the full weight of his experience to bear on a part that seems almost to become like a second skin for him, at times. Not to imply that the task of assuming a dual identity should be viewed as a burden. Far from it. RDJ is clearly having fun with the chance to put his quirky sensibilities to use in more mainstream fare again, now that he is older and wiser. There are many who would have doubtless echoed the sentiment that he is ""not the superhero type"" when news of his enlistment first broke, but here he proves beyond any doubt that he fits this particular bill perfectly.Alloyed (geddit?!) to a couple of instances of fine casting, there is a story that surprisingly manages to successfully combine an almost fetishistic celebration of badass technology with the altogether simpler drama of human dilemma. We are given a mini robot war at the film's climax for example, that knocks the ENTIRETY of last year's ""Transformers"" squarely on its backside, and demonstrates deftly to Michael Bay the opportunity for emotional investment that he so obviously missed.This is a serving of pre-summer fun with a fair bit of heart behind the machinery. If you're after a blockbuster that boasts a respectable quota of acting talent to its name, then I think you'll find this is one confection knocked together that actually polishes up rather well! Like Iron Man itself, then.","9/10"
"Iron Man","jhobdell","1 May 2008","Right from the start (perhaps even beforehand) I was expecting this to be quite special. As usual entertainment is my only requirement of a film for me to like it and this was fabulous. There are so many elements that make it work. In terms of the storyline, there is at least just enough of everything to make it hang together well: enough background to qualify Stark's naivety and arrogance (plus enough of Downey Jr's boyish charm to make him a believable celebrity industrialist!) besides his genius; enough of the water torture scene to make his submission acceptable (and enough visible anger to both drive and carry his deception); there is enough chemistry between Downey Jr and Paltrow to hint at the relationship that never quite blooms; and finally there is enough left hanging to betray a sequel possibly already on the table. Downey Jr largely carries the film in terms of the acting; Paltrow is on fine form but hardly used to her full potential (for a rare but wonderful glimpse of this I recommend ""Proof""). Favreau's almost Hitchcockian cameo is downplayed sufficiently for it not to seem either contrived or haphazard. Ultimately, though, I think my hat is off to Jeff Bridges as possibly the most hate-able villain of the Marvel franchise so far.The use of heavy metal-esquire music for the soundtrack is quite appropriate given the title! And to conclude, the transformation/revelation of most of the characters is remarkable: Stark from self-involved to regretful, Potts from indulgent and condescending to affectionate, Stane from colleague to nemesis. I recognise the possibility of a sequel justifying it, but this didn't quite get to 9 for me purely because the ending is a little too unclosed. That tiny thing aside, this was magic; enjoy!","9/10"
"Iron Man","ftyl","13 May 2008","Iron Man is the first feature to be made entirely by Marvel  a gamble which has paid off to the tune of over $350 million worldwide so far. For a non-sequel from a fledgling company that is impressive and bodes well for Marvel's reboot of The Incredible Hulk  due in June. Comic book films are big money spinners now but the success of a new series is predicated on the entertainment value of the central character  and in this way Hulk and Tony Stark have similar problems. They just aren't super enough...Iron Man starts with an unnecessary flashback structure, presumably to ensure some loud action in the first minute or two. Tony Stark (played with now-familiar post-rehab gusto by Robert Downey Jnr.) is the embodiment of the capitalistic, jingoistic American ideal. He has become absurdly rich designing weapons and, more significantly, has no moral qualms whatsoever about the negative effects of his work. Stark is not a nice man. Except he is. This potentially realistic and complex dualistic behaviour is lost in the film's failure to choose sides, leading us to the first of many problems; what are we, the audience, supposed to think of Tony Stark? He is presented as bright and brilliant; a charming man of the people but also as a womaniser and a warlord. This initial confusion is nothing compared to what happens later on. After a brush with death and a subsequent escape (which is accomplished in an ultra-violent fashion) he holds a hippie press conference and vows to stop making weapons for good.This turnaround is simply too fast and, as presented by Downey Jnr. with his usual twinkly-eyed glazed look, has none of the power or angst we have come to expect from comic book origin stories. His parents are not murdered before his eyes, nor is his home world destroyed. He comes across as a petulant child who is bored with his old toys. Instead of using his money to work for peace or help starving children he creates a powered battle suit and flies around the world blowing things up. Exactly how this is 'protecting the people he put in harm's way' is slightly beyond me. And the hypocrisy of the double standard is appalling  it is only when Stark realises that (Shock! Horror!) his weapons might be used against American troops that he begins to examine his conscience.Don't get the wrong idea, there is nothing particularly obnoxious about Iron Man. The performances are light and breezy and the script is a cut about the blockbuster norm; littered as it is with a particularly dry sense of humour. The central performance from Robert Downey Jnr. is the film's saving grace but also its' Achilles heel. His presence is enjoyable on the one hand but, in my opinion, also detracts from the credibility of the whole endeavour. You keep expecting him to wink to camera and finally admit it is some kind of extravagant Saturday Night Live parody. That Jeff Bridges is really being played by Will Ferrell and Terrence Howard is actually just a cardboard cutout. I still don't get Terrance Howard. I've yet to see him raise a palpable, or even guessable, emotion in his roles  his face seems oddly expressionless and his voice almost unbearable. He gets some good lines in this film but sounds like he's reading them from an auto cue. But I digress. As once off summer entertainment this kind of self aware film-making is bearable but I simply can't see the film becoming a much loved classic in the future.So, what does the film have going for it? The special effects are impressive, with the integration of cg and live action especially so. The set pieces, when they come, run the gamut from mundane to genuinely thrilling. Stark's armoured escape from captivity is surprisingly dull while some of the later aerial combat sequences are exciting. Once again though, the use of sfx has positive and negative effects, particularly in relation to the ending. The final confrontation has become a serious problem for the superhero film. In days of yore, special effects were difficult, so typically the best the film had to offer was saved for the ending. Now, every scene is liberally slathered with computer generated gunk. The result is explosive fatigue, a run of overpowering sequences which forgo actual affect for special effect. A dozen astonishingly well-rendered high octane scenes does not create a cumulative effect. If the same level of frankly awe-inspiring cg work is applied to the hero designing and dressing in his suit then what is left for the audience to look forward to. What makes a special effect special these days? The ending of Iron Man is another clunky computer-aided brawl, where narrative is suspended for minutes at a time while increasingly unrealistic pieces of metal and flesh beat on each other. This moment is reminiscent of a dozen other recent movie resolutions: from Hellboy to The Matrix Revolutions, all equally dull. Without vicarious involvement  a sense that a character we can identify with is in danger  it just amounts to so many polygons.Perhaps I've been a little harsh on Iron Man. I can't honestly say I was bored by the experience but I do feel its' major mis-steps are a symptom of a greater malaise at the heart of contemporary blockbuster cinema. If, however, your cynicism has not quite reached the pathological degree mine has you could well have some fun with Iron Man. Robert Downey Jnr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow are amiable enough company (even if the latter seems as though an errant puff of wind would shatter her into a million pieces) and the director, Jon Favreau, keeps things moving at a reasonable pace. Stark's character arc is minimal (more of a character stroll really) but his near trademarked delivery of PG-13 witticisms should be enough to hold your attention. Just.","10/10"
"Iron Man","CuriosityKilledShawn","7 February 2012","Despite being a huge hit and a definite crowd-pleaser, Iron Man is actually quite a shallow, unexciting movie. It's not something you can make a night out of watching once you've seen it once. I'd classify it as a movie you can have on while doing the ironing or something. It's a pure cheeseburger movie with no substance at all.Tony Stark (Downey Jnr. in a star-remaking role) is one of the top genius minds on the planet, but when he's captured by generic Arabs he secretly creates a robotic armor costume to break free. Impressed by the suits potential and abilities he refines it upon returning to safe, sunny Malibu. As soon as the suit is ready to go he jets off to Arabistan to kill/subdue the enemy with lots of safe, bloodless action. Beneath this flimsy plot his right-hand man Obediah Stane conspires to steal Stark Industries from right underneath him.There is no depth to Iron Man. The plot involving the Arabs is resolved fairly quickly and the succeeding plot feels like a last-minute afterthought. The Arabs have no mentioned affiliation or motives, since we don't want to scare the kiddies. The action is just a little too cartoonish, and Iron Man himself just looks like a video-game character. There's no tangible edge to this film and very little of it feels real or credible.The ending features the hero and villain inside robotic armor, one lean, one monstrous, clobbering eat other until one of them falls over and doesn't get up again. I'm sure I saw they exact same thing in a movie back in 1990. What was it called again? There's a scene after the credits that sets-up the long, long, long in-development Avengers movie, which I honestly could not care less about.","7/10"

Even if the villain Obadiah stane is a little weak (although the iron monger suit is cool and Jeff bridges is great in the role), the movie easily makes up for that with impressive effects, great comedy, awesome action scenes, great character work with tony stark, and good performances (gwenyth Paltrow and Shaun Toub were standouts). But what makes this film great is Robert Downey Jr who absolutely nails tony stark (not only making him funny and likable but also showing the nice side in tony).

"Iron Man","CowherPowerForever","9 April 2015","The Following Review Will Contain Spoilers! Iron Man from the year 2008 marks the first film in a series of Marvel films. This series is now known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Is it the first universe on film? Of course not, but so far the people behind the scenes have crafted something amazing. Iron Man was the first piece in this puzzle. It was a big risk for Paramount at the time, but it payed off into something so big, that Disney had to buy it. The following is my review of Iron Man.Iron Man was written by Matt Holloway, Art Marcum, Hawk Ostby, and Mark Fergus. Fergus and Ostby had actually worked together a few times in the past on some smaller films, and even the 2006 film Children of Men. Since Iron Man was made in 2008, they have worked together on Cowboys & Aliens. Holloway and Marcum also worked together on the 2008 comic book film Punisher: War Zone. A favorite of mine. So they all some good experience before coming on board with this film. Some better than others, but even still.The story follows Tony Stark, a weapons dealer for the United States government. Tony is in the Middle East showing off his new Jericho missile. On his way back to base, his crew is attacked, and Tony is taken hostage. The terrorist leader who had him kidnapped wants Tony to build him one of these Jericho missiles. Tony turns this around to build his first Iron Man suit, and thus escapes back home. During his time in the middle East as a hostage, Tony has second thoughts on selling weapons that kill people. This is where the story really picks up. I don't want to give away the entire story, but the film features some great twists and turns. The villain of the film Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges) is still one of my favorite MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) villains. His character was written greatly, and Bridges was the perfect fit for the role. One of my major issues with the story, is what comes at the end. Again this will be a major spoiler. Tony Stark reveals at the end that he in fact is Iron Man to the public. I did not like this part, and would have liked it more had they gone the traditional route. Either way, the story ended up being amazing, and was a great start to this huge universe. The story writers here deserve big credit.The film was directed by Jon Favreau. Favreau not only directed this film, but also came back to direct the sequel. He is also known for films like Elf, Zathura: A Space Adventure, and Cowboys & Aliens. The film is visually amazing. Though there are times that the CG looks cartoonish. The action scenes are fun, but this is not a big action blockbuster. For about the first forty five minutes or so, there is only light action. Even the final battle between Iron Man and Stane only lasts about five to seven minutes. The story and the characters really carry this film. Which leads me to this fabulous cast of actors. The film is lead by Robert Downey Jr., and co-stars Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Faran Tahir, and so many other actors in smaller roles. After having seen this movie many times since 2008, I still enjoy watching it for the amazing chemistry all the actors had together. Faveau delivered amazing action when the film called for it, it mostly looked nice, and he brought together this great cast of actors and had them make this great film.The film was composed by Ramin Djawadi. He is now known for his amazing score on Pacific Rim. That score is still one of my favorites to this very day. This score however for Iron Man, well it just wasn't that great. It does add some nice depth to the overall film, but it is just a good score, and not a great one. Some may disagree with me on this aspect, but I stand by my opinion. Again, it wasn't bad, just not great as some of his other work.In closing, this is just a fantastic start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man is such a fun and entertaining film that the whole family could likely enjoy. The film has amazing acting, and a great story. There are some aspects to the story and I didn't care for, but nothing that hurts the film. Those wanting to get caught up on the MCU, this is where it all began, and this is a great beginning. It should not disappoint the average movie fan.8/10I will be back to Review the next MCU film in the series, The Incredible Hulk.","9/10"
"Iron Man","megoobee","26 May 2013","Let me start off by saying I love this movie, I must have watched it at least 20 times, maybe more. The story was well written and covered life, death, self exploration and rebirth. This was an action movie that took the time to build the story and not rely solely on slam-bam action to keep the audience's attention. Anyone who tells you that they were not moved by Yinsen's death scene is probably not telling the truth. We the audience got to know two Starks, the self indulging, selfish person and a morally correct one. Some questioned his change, others wanted to bury him for it.There is plenty of action but the story is what really raised the bar from average to above average. We see Stark slowly become Iron Man after surviving a few hilarious mishaps and fire extinguisher assaults. We see him struggle with moral conflicts and finally deciding to make a difference. The antagonist twist was nicely done, we are lead to believe that the obvious villain is the main antagonist. Nope, a more sinister character lurked in the background which made the story much more interesting and satisfying.Of all of the ""Avengers"" prequel movies (eg: Thor, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk) this is the best in my opinion. Grab a big glass of your favorite beverage, prepare some microwave popcorn, sit back and be prepare for a couple hours of great entertainment.","8/10"

Rip-roaring big screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics' cult-classic superhero AKA billionaire extraordinaire Tony Stark (Downey having a field day), an industrialist/arms manufacturer who has his eyes opened to the horrors of his financial gains when he is kidnapped by terrorists and manages his escape by creating an armored suit as his ticket to freedom and regrouping by protecting those he has put in harms way.

Screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway hammer out a competent, sharp and clever storyline that incorporates origin story cum legend with strong support by director Jon Favreau (who has a bit part as Stark's valet) incorporating stunning ILM CGI, and wisely allowing his actors to shine, particularly Downey's sexy/brainy/snarky Stark with sterling clear-eyed focus and dollops of humor that take off the edge of 'serious'ness, resulting in a humdinger popcorn crowd pleaser and sooth-sayer to the fan boys. Paltrow, in one of her finest turns, is also a breath of fresh air as Stark's personal assistant/love interest Pepper Potts and Howard's unconventional performance as his best bud Jim Rhodes, a military liaison, proves a primer of how a second banana should be played. High-octane thrills and a lot of fun (including the inevitable- and arguably the funniest  Stan Lee cameo) an instant classic and one of the very best comic book adaptations committed to the silver screen; cannot wait for the sequel!","7/10"
"Iron Man","sol-","26 May 2017","Based on the iconic comic book character, 'Iron Man' follows a weapons engineer who manufactures a flying armor suit and has to stop those interested in copying the suit for their own evil purposes. Robert Downey Jr. is well cast as the arrogant, wise-cracking protagonist. Shot down in the Middle East, his shock and utter disbelief over his weapons being sold on the black market, causing more harm than good, never quite rings true. His naivety does, however, allow for a solid character progression as he goes from only caring about how much money his company makes to genuinely caring about how his weapons are used. The film spends a refreshingly large amount of time on Downey's back- story too; there are only scattered action scenes during the first half of the movie as the focus is always making Downey's flawed character likable before he turns superhero. The other characters are sadly less interesting. Unrecognisable at first with one zany hairdo, Jeff Bridges has some fun bits, but the likes of Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are given little to do; the film also keeps going back and forth on the possibility of Paltrow as a love interest for Downey. Between the film's robot butler, the in-depth character back-story and Downey's charisma, 'Iron Man' has a lot going in its favour, but whether it is truly one of the better superhero movies out there is debatable.","7/10"
"Iron Man","desire_911","4 May 2008","After watching the overblown Spider-Man 3 last year; and the special effects driven Transformers, I was beginning to think that Hollywood didn't know how to make a decent comic book movie anymore. Then Jon Favreau directed Iron Man. The first thing that he does right is casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He brings a presence to the character that only he could and has the greatest one-liners that would even put Spider-Man to shame. Jeff Bridges, Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are also great in their supporting roles. I loved the banter between Pepper and Stark. However, some fans may be disappointed by the lack of CGI and action scenes but I think it works for the better. It's grounded in reality and unlike Transformers, this film has realistic special effects and the CGI seamlessly blends in with all of the practical effects; most notably the Iron Man suit. And after watching Stark tinker around with his first two prototypes (watching the scene in which he tries to fly is priceless), it's a real payoff when after an hour we finally get to see him in action. This makes more sense than other comic book adaptations because we get to see the suit in three different stages. And besides all the action it's the most fun I've ever had watching a movie. There are so many scenes that end with a punch you won't regret watching this with a large audience. Not to mention that it ends on a great note. Also, comic book fans will dig the hints at a sequel and especially the post credit scene. Fans in our theater went crazy. (I won't spoil it for you.) Bottom line, Iron Man Delivers what a good comic book film should. It may not have the brooding darkness of Batman Begins, or the over the top special effects of Transformers, but it's a fun movie that has a terrific blend of humor, a great story, and not to mention some kick-ass action to go along with it. In the end my score is 8.5/10 ""B""","9/10"

"Iron Man","ZekeRage911","5 August 2009","I'm often a very cynical, skeptical, pessimistic SOB when it comes to movies, having been horribly disappointed by virtually every comic book movie adaptation to date, so when Iron Man came out, I was prepared for another long camp-fest full of impressive special effects and the sound of Stan Lee stroking himself in the background.Boy was I wrong! Iron man is at times gritty, and at times beautiful, and it blends together so seamlessly you wouldn't think this was a superhero movie. In fact, it's not a super hero movie, it's a movie about a flawed character who realizes he's been a total dupe, and a complete ass, and is so horrified by the consequences of his own ignorance and arrogance that he sets out to try and change things. This is the sort of story that's at the heart of every Marvel Superhero, really, but it's often told so badly that you never really get the point.Spider Man and Spider Man 2 got very close to this, and even went so far as to show that most people are complete ingrates when you go around saving their lives, especially in New York, which might be why Tony Stark lives in Malibu.Robert Downey Junior, a functional alcoholic, falls into the role brilliantly, what with the role being that of a functional alcoholic, and his performance is both charismatic and gripping, making you care about a man you also want to punch out.Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, read: The Bad Guy, and he's got smarmy, greedy bastard practically tattooed on his forehead from shot one. But that doesn't detract from the movie, actually, it feels perfectly natural. Plus he gets points for zooming around on a segue at one point, in a segue scene, oh Jon Favreau, you cheeky son of a...All in all, this is a great movie. It's not Oscar winner material or anything, but I'll watch it any day, over and over, than six minutes of the Phantom Menace.","9/10"
"Iron Man","AnnaShade","8 November 2008","When I rented this movie, I procrastinated for a week before watching it. I thought, why should I watch yet another superhero movie? Haven't I seen enough of them in my short lifetime? Expecting to be entertained by unimpressed, I decided to watch Iron Man.The first thing I noticed right off the bat was the sharp dialog delivered by the excellent main actor. It was witty, crisp, and not lacking in the least. When I watch a movie, lame dialog is one of the worst things a movie can inflict upon me. Another thing I hate is bad CGI, and this movie had none of that. They pulled out all the stops on this one.I recommend this movie highly, especially if you enjoy really cool explosions. Explosions are an art form, people, and this movie is a work of genius.","7/10"

This movie perfectly establishes all the important characters and relationships. Pepper and Tony have a very natural progression of a relationship. Tony and Rhodey are hilarious together. The writing allows the actors to have very natural conversation, which makes the movie really funny. The villain of the movie might not be the best, but I wouldn't dare to complain about it. This is still one of the better MCU stories in the universe.","10/10"
"Iron Man","maharousewagdi","28 May 2021","Bringing another Marvel Comics hero to the big screen, IRON MAN begins as brilliant billionaire industrialist/inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is abducted during a weapons demonstration tour in Afghanistan. Grievously wounded by the very weapons his company manufactures, Stark is forced by his terrorist captors to build a missile; instead, he designs a high-tech suit of armor to make his escape. Returning to America, he wonders how the bad guys got hold of his company's products and vows to set things right with the help of a rebuilt, stylish new iteration of the powered exoskeleton that made his escape possible.Robert Downey Jr. Was perfect for this movie. He has shaped the character in a very good way. You will love his acting skills and his character Tony Stark. The transition from Tony Stark to superhero is great. He first found a friend after being captured by a group of terrorists. He made iron suits to fight the bad guys. The romance between Tony and Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts was fascinating. There was an Arc Reactor that was Tony's artificial heart in the movie. This is one of the most important symbols of MCU. Marvel tried to give the audience suspense which was one of the best things about the movie about the villain character.","9/10"
"Iron Man","garlonuss","5 May 2008","I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well.","9/10"

"Iron Man","LW-08854","24 December 2023","Iron man, released in 2008, DC had already set about releasing superhero films with dark brooding tones, including Watchmen and Batman begins. Tony Stark however is introduced however as a colourful flamboyant character, headstrong and cocky, a man who enjoys showing off and having his own way.A period of captivity however confronts him with the reality of his actions, his weapons company is not the force for good he believed it was and he decides from now he will focus his money and talent on protecting people. In the spirit of Spider-man (2001) Batman Begins (2004) our protagonist comes to a moment of realization that he must use his abilities to start helping other people and to sort of the bad guys. The film also features a love interest, just like Spider-man and Batman Begins, Iron man also features a love interest who will be put in peril during the final showdown as well as a former friend ally who turns out to be the films true villain. Summed up like this the film sounds a bit formulaic and some of the dialogue during the fight scenes a little by the numbers. However that said, the really strong performances from Robert Downey Jr and Jeff Brides, plus very well directed action sequences and the soundtrack really elevate this movie beyond okay to really very good.","9/10"
"Iron Man","vithiet","30 April 2021","As a long time Marvel Comics fan, I remember how excited I was for this movie back when it came out in the theaters and how much I loved it. 13 years later, it is still a near perfect movie that set up the stage perfectly for every other MCU movie that followed it. Special effects still stand, and the storytelling, directing, acting are all on point; there is never a wasted scene, and its relative sober nature compare to the later extravagant MCU flicks helps making it feel a lot more grounded. And let's face it: casting Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark was the probably one of the best casting decisions ever made in Hollywood!","8/10"
"Iron Man","harry_tk_yung","10 May 2008","""I am not the heroic type, clearly"", says Tony Stark in a press conference at the end of the movie. Robert Downey Jr., however, is clearly the best man for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, a comic book character that is at once simple and complex. Genius, multi-billionaire, flamboyant, flippant  RDJ can do that in his sleep. It's when it comes to the complete recklessness of flying to the outer whatever-sphere on a whim that you really love the man.But the movie is not all whims. They have taken their good time in developing the first sequence of captivity and escape. Sure, being able to manufacture the first version of Iron Man in the cave under constantly CCTV surveillance taxes credibility to the limit but you tend to forgive and forget when your attention is drawn to the effective script, neat direction and excellent acting.The dialogue is one cut above the usual Marvel Comic genre, for example, Stark's retort when confronted by a challenging reporter at the beginning of the movie. There are of course also the expected snappy lines such as Stark to bartender, ""Give me a scotch, I'm starving"". Best though is devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) claws-out exchange with the sexy reporter in the morning after the latter's sojourning in Stark's apartment, the bit about taking out the trash.Paltrow's role brings to mind immediately Amy Adams' in ""Charlie Wilson's War"" (2007). While both are devoted personal assistants to a womanizing boss, Adams' character is strictly business while with Peltrow, there is a tantalizing romantic touch, played just right.The special effects are just fine, which is quite a complimentary assessment as it is very difficult today to impress an audience in that department, an audience that has seen everything. ""Iron man"" stands above most others in the genre by offering and telling a good story, playing every card just right and, above all, having Robert Downey Jr.","7/10"

And although the first part of the trilogy was only a breakdown of the pen, the film for 2008 looks great. Yes, it lacks dynamics, the first half of the film is in no way similar to most Marvel projects. And the final scene is frankly weak. Iron Man is a good start to the trilogy, there is no point in considering the film separately.","9/10"

The director's obsession with tedious special effects adds to the woes of an awful script. The climactic battle between Good Medium-Sized Iron Man and Bad Over-Sized Iron Man is utterly ridiculous. Downey gives a pretty good performance, keeping this from becoming a total failure. The best thing about the film is the relationship between him and Paltrow.

"Iron Man","WriterDave","6 May 2008","The crown prince of America's premier weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (a sober Robert Downey Jr.) grows a conscience after being captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and decides to fight for what's right in an innovative piece of body armor technology that will henceforth be known as ""Iron Man"" in Jon Favreau's predictable but fun Marvel comic film adaptation.Wisely abandoning the corny mawkishness of the ""Spiderman"" films and the recent attempt to revive the ""Superman"" franchise, ""Iron Man"" instead offers up some light satire, bright-eyed cynicism, and an attempt at witty banter. The always lovely Gwyneth Paltrow is a delight as Stark's sassy assistant Pepper Potts, and it's nice to see her doing something light and fun for a change. Also part of the off-kilter cast are Terrence Howard as Stark's inexplicable military friend and Jeff Bridges bald and bearded as Stark's mentor (and dun dun dun...enemy?) Downey Jr. apparently ad-libbed much of the dialog, which sometimes falls flat, but for the most part works. It's certainly far more enjoyable than the typical fan-boy in-jokes that plague most comic book movies.Certainly this is no ""Batman Begins"" in terms of depth and scope of drama, but with slam-bang special effects and an effortless feel (despite a slow build up to the action), ""Iron Man"" certainly fits the bill as a better than average comic book/action film. Is it any wonder critics and audiences have embraced it so warmly after suffering through loud obnoxious dreck like ""Transformers?"" While it has been a bit oversold, ""Iron Man"" proves that great special effects can be built around a smart story that doesn't have to pander to the lowest common denominator. Until ""The Dark Knight"" it will have to cure our cinematic anemia.","8/10"

The themes they used beyond making it a simple superhero origin film and the parallels to Downey's own life makes this more interesting.","9/10"
"Iron Man","ElijahCSkuggs","7 May 2008","So George was wrong. Tony Stark does wear clothing under the armor. I always hoped he was naked. Oh well.Iron Man was a weird time. I enjoyed it overall quite a bit, but there were moments when I just didn't give a damn. My issues are minor, but for nit-picking semi-comic book nerds, they are just. My earlier comic book experiences with Tony Stark gave me a completely different impression. Stark is more of a gentleman like character. And though Downey had to include his attitude into the role, it still worked. One thing I did not care for in the slightest was the News Reporter gal. Her role was annoying (I get it), much too distracting and just a weak part of the script. And she never got her ""come-up-ins"". Stupid chick even interrupted when she wasn't supposed to! She should have been booted outta there! There were a couple talky parts, I suppose to add depth to the friendships, but overall they were just boring and felt unneeded. Again, minor issues that don't take anything away from the main aspects to the film.But the action, special effects and acting by Downey and Bridges were all really good. Actually it may have the best effects I've seen yet in a super hero movie. But ya can't forget about the effects in Howard the Duck. And Favreau did a decent enough job as well. Overall, this should be a really fun on-going Marvel movies series. If you want an entertaining, great looking action flick, look no further.","9/10"

"Iron Man","classicsoncall","12 May 2008","So here I am in my late fifties with enough of a connection to my comic book collecting past to be intrigued by modern day super hero films. Now I was never a Marvel Comics geek, my favorite characters were the mainstays of the DC Comics universe, like Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, et al. But if you were a fan, you couldn't help but know about the alternative universe that contained Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The X-Men and Iron Man, which brings us to the subject at hand. I thought that the movie did a credible job of spanning the forty year comic book history of Iron Man about as well as could be expected in a distilled down two hour movie. Particularly effective was the way we see how the origin costume in the picture pays tribute to the early Iron Man years, while the modern day red and gold armor conveys the advance of science and technology into the twenty first century. Comic book purists will most likely have serious issues with the picture, but I've been able to get over the whole faithfulness to continuity issue some time ago. What I'm looking for in a flick like ""Iron Man"" is an opportunity to be entertained for a couple of hours, and there's enough here to have some fun and be just that - entertained.The one thing I AM looking for in the Marvel universe pictures is the ubiquitous cameo appearance of Stan Lee, creator of many of the comic book icons we recognize today. He's incorrectly credited in the cast listing as I write this, as he's listed appearing as himself. What you need to do is pay attention to that party scene in the casino when Tony Stark says hi to 'Hef'. That was just the coolest way to get Stan into the picture, and I give him a lot of credit for not taking himself too seriously as he truly is one of the gods of comic book history.As for the picture, it's easy enough to bash it for it's adherence to current world events and the milieu of extremist terrorism. But is that any worse than reliving the events of the early 1960's and placing the character in the middle of the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? The present day Iron Man can be a product of his time and still be effective as a symbol of patriotism and honor, even while the rest of the country is immersed in presidential primaries and partisan politics.You have to give credit to the selection of Robert Downey Jr. for the Iron Man role. Perhaps his own bouts with substance abuse uniquely prepared him for an outstanding performance as the conflicted title character. However the character I was intrigued with the most was Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, I just couldn't get over his appearance as Tony Stark's operations chief. The role was played with just the right amount of reserve and just below the surface malice; I thought he did an excellent job. Gwyneth Paltrow had pretty much a thankless job as Stark's personal assistant and secret admirer and it didn't seem to me that her performance was all that stand out.As an aside, the one thing I feel I do have to comment on is a personal gripe of mine relative to the IMDb ranking system. As I write this, ""Iron Man"" sits at number #130 of the all time best films as ranked by current users. It seems to me that the way fans line up behind a picture even before it's released, there ought to be a moratorium of say, two or three years before a new release could be eligible for Top 250 ranking. When you consider the truly great films of all time like ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"", it's hard for me to reconcile a popcorn flick like this one to be considered in the same breath. I feel the same way (as to a voting moratorium) about stunning pictures like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"". If a picture has the legs to stand up as an all time great, it will be remembered a couple years after it's original release. Remember all the fanboy hype about ""Serenity""? Does anyone even care about that picture today? See what I mean?","6/10"
"Iron Man","hanalisss","4 December 2023","Iron Man stands as a cinematic marvel, no pun intended, and it's not just the armor that shines. This film, directed by Jon Favreau, is a masterclass in modern superhero storytelling that laid the foundation for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).It succeeds due to Robert Downey Jr.'s tour de force performance as Tony Stark. He effortlessly embodies the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, bringing a charismatic and witty energy to the character that is nothing short of iconic. The casting choice was a stroke of genius, and Downey Jr.'s portrayal is one for the ages.The narrative arc of Tony Stark's transformation from a self-absorbed arms dealer to the selfless hero we come to admire is expertly crafted. The character development is palpable, and we witness Stark's evolution both physically and emotionally. The script balances humor, action, and heart with finesse, creating a film that resonates on multiple levels.The visual spectacle is breathtaking. The CGI work on the Iron Man suits is groundbreaking, making the superhero tech feel tangible and awe-inspiring. The suit-up sequences are iconic, and the action scenes are both exhilarating and visually stunning. The film strikes a perfect balance between intimate character moments and high-octane superhero action.Moreover, the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges as the formidable Obadiah Stane, delivers stellar performances that complement Downey Jr.'s lead. The chemistry between characters feels genuine, adding depth to the film's emotional beats.Iron Man is not just a superhero film; it's a cultural phenomenon that redefined the genre. It laid the groundwork for the interconnected storytelling that became the MCU's trademark. From its engaging narrative to the charismatic lead, impressive visuals, and memorable supporting cast, it remains a cinematic triumph, setting the gold standard for superhero movies and kickstarting a franchise that would go on to dominate the global box office.","9/10"
"Iron Man","DarthVoorhees","9 May 2008","I honestly didn't know what to expect with this film. Marvel has been very hit and miss as of late and I really think that the last truly great film they made was Spider-Man 2 04. Iron Man is a treat and a reprieve from the Ghost Riders, Electras', Blade Trinitys', and Spider-Man 3s' of recent years. Robert Downey Jr IS Iron Man. He is absolutely outstanding in the title role of Tony Stark. He has a huge on-screen presence and he is really what drives this movie which has an outstanding cast. He captures the persona of the Stark character perfectly. Some say it is because they have similar character traits and I simply don't think that's true. Tony Stark is the anti-superhero and you have to be clever and witty to make him appeal to the audience who expects the Romantic good guy in a quest against evil. Stark builds his new suit out of curiosity to see how far the limits could be pushed rather than doing it out of a conviction to fight off villains. The last exchange between Stark and Pepper is a direct parody of the entire Spider-Man film series. Stark is not your average hero and he makes it known. They remain faithful to Stark's personality and thus the movie can offer the audience a treat in the world of summer superheroes.The story of Iron Man was written as a critique of the Cold War ideas but the story transfers verily well to our modern War on Terror. Stark is a patriot and when he sees his weapons being fired on American soldiers he gains the conviction to become something better than what he once was. There is some critique of weaponry and war but it is mainly about how Tony comes to the realization that war must be used for the right reasons and he comes to this through his capture in the film's beginning. Starks reaction to seeing his weapons in the hands of terrorists is portrayed very well by Downey. We are able to see inside the real Tony Stark past the playboy.The special effects are realistic. ILM shows that they don't need superheros to be in the dark to make them look like living breathing beings.My complaint about the film is the final battle. The dialogue and the fight choreography are bad enough to be in your Saturday morning cartoon. Jeff Bridges is an immensely talented actor and to hear him deliver pitiful cliché lines is somewhat of a disappointment.","10/10"
"Iron Man","jemps918","1 May 2008","Surprisingly fun! The trailer definitely underpromised and overdelivered. Watched Iron Man as requisite summer movie blockbuster viewing; ended up happily enjoying it. The incredibly talented Robert Downey Jr. made Iron Man work by animating the character with his own inherent eccentricities.Iron Man draws several parallels with other superheroes. For one, he has a lot in common with Batman. Just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a rich, orphan playboy gifted with the aptitude for high technology. Instead of having the elderly Alfred as butler, however, Stark has personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), a pair of artificially intelligent robots (adorable scene stealers that have adapted puppy-like personalities) and best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). Just like Superman, he sleeps with a reporter, Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb), and has someone close to him for his arch nemesis.Writer/actor/producer/director Jon Favreau is a revelation, helming this action-adventure flick with disarming deftness; it's clear he enjoyed directing this film. How can he not with an unexpectedly well-written, relevant script and a talented cast that includes the chameleon-like Jeff Bridges and cameos from Stan Lee and Samuel L. Jackson. The special effects are excellent and the editing was just right, even if it runs over two hours. Overcoming its corny name, Iron Man has all the makings of a successful franchise!","5/10"

But this all changes when he goes to Afghanistan to show off his latest weapon and is taken hostage by terrorists and forced to build a weapon for them. Instead, he builds a super-hero suit and uses it to break free and go back to America, where he reveals a change of heart in relation to his profession and tries to aim his talents more at peace than war. But this doesn't go down well with his boss Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who's only worried about the profits they will lose now Tony no longer wants to make weapons. And when Tony learns that his company has been making under-handed deals with the men who held him captive, he uses the super-hero suit he made once again and becomes Iron Man. But his corrupt boss has ideas of his own in regards making his own super-hero suit...You can always count on a good super-hero film to fill in the obligatory summer blockbuster slot in the filmic year, and this year we have this adaptation of one of Marvel Comic's truly lesser known creations, which just shows how far towards the bottom of the barrel we're scraping. An ambitious piece that seems to have caught onto the trend of making extra long summer blockbusters, this tries to invest a lot of unnecessary depth and characterization into a story that's ultimately not worth the effort.It just feels overlong instead of something really special. Okay, Iron Man isn't your typical action hero. He doesn't just magically get his super powers like Superman or Spider-Man, we see him struggle to get his super-suit to work, failing to guide it properly and make the special gadgets work, but the whole piece just feels overly labourious, with an uninvolving, predictable script that fails to rise out the ground.Cast wise, in the lead role, Downey Jr. is an odd but admittently effective choice, a snazzy, cynical anti hero who slowly sees through his own BS but he's just not enough to keep the whole boat afloat. Bridges is also a decent choice as the villain, but the weak script fails to make the most out of him, while in support rising star Terrence Howard goes through the motions as a comic relief Air Force colonel and Gwyneth Paltrow is noticeable as a personal assistant with a ridiculous name.All these type of films just seem so manufactured nowadays, with so much back story stretching them out so long and enough publicity to guarantee a great opening weekend and an obligatory equally inferior sequel a year or so later. For all it's quantity instead of quality, Iron Man truly has an Iron Soul. **","3/10"
"Iron Man","Slarkshark","28 January 2024","'Iron Man' starts the MCU off with a big bang, and over 30 movies later, it still holds up as one of it's best entries.I remember before this came out there was a lot of uncertainty and trepidation. RDJ had previously hit rock bottom and was in no way regarded as a bankable star. Favreau wanted him and had vision. He had faith in RDJ and the character of Stark/Iron Man.It's hard to believe, but Iron Man was not a well known character to non comic book people and it was a gamble kicking off a possible franchise with a relatively unknown character. I'd say it paid off. Also, comic book movies were not trending at that time, and had a recent rough history, with few successes. Since then, this movie and everything to follow completely changed the movie landscape, for better or worse.Terrance Howard was a great Colonel Rhodes and it's too bad he got greedy. I would have really liked to see him carry on the role. Don Cheadle has been a good replacement though, so I don't really have any complaints. Maybe Howard comes back in the multiverse?","8/10"
"Iron Man","dvc5159","1 May 2008","With this film, Marvel's little known comic book superhero is immortalized. The film is big, spectacular, fun, grandiose... in every sense.Robert Downey Jr is terrific as Stark as he shows charm, wit, brains and brawn. His lines are spot on and he brings seems to make Stark into his own, as they have similar traits, making him blend well into his character and making it likable. Jeff Bridges does a convincing Job as the villain. Terrence Howard is okay as Stark's Air Defense pal, and it's nice to see Gwyneth Paltrow in a major film after a long absence, she is simply adorable in this film.The special effects are nicely handled and realistic, and it shows the film's $150 million budget. To quote a fellow reviewer, it's nice to see the use of CGI to the fullest and utmost extent, especially the construction of the suit. The action sequences are handled nicely thus provide excellent eye candy, making them exhilarating. Kudos to director Jon Favreau for really keeping his promise.Great lines, great actors, excellent action scenes and special effects, this movie has the ingredients of a popcorn masterpiece. See it with a bunch of friends, who knows, I'll maybe see it again. This is an excellent way to start the summer, and also the best superhero film since 2005's ""Batman Begins"", and that's saying something.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall value: 8.9/10Delton","8/10"
"Iron Man","neil-476","1 May 2008","First things first - I have never had an Iron Man comic, I don't think - Iron Man is simply an incidental character in other comics I've read. Kind of like Marvel's Aquaman (although I have at least had some Aquaman comics from time to time). So I'm pretty unfamiliar with Iron Man's mythology, origin, supporting cast etc., and I'm therefore not in a position to say whether the movie is faithful to its origins or not. I'm simply approaching it as a generic super-hero movie.There is much to like in this film, although I came out entertained but not jazzed. Downey is great, the effects are mostly fine, Bridges is a very good duplicitous villain, the chemistry between Downey and Paltrow is good, and there are some nice moments in the script. And I was surprised to find it was 2 hours, it felt more like 90 minutes as it whizzed by.But it left me curiously unmoved, unengaged. I didn't care that much about these characters. On an overall entertainment level I would put it on a par with the FF movies, with the key distinction that the relationship between the FF meant that you did care about them. Not so here.Having said that, the ""first night out"" in the revamped suit is GREAT - really fun and exhilarating.","8/10"
"Iron Man","chera_khalid","2 October 2023","Iron Man, the blast that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the stratosphere, and oh, did it soar. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark is a magnetic force, blending genius with a hefty dose of charisma that had me rooting for the billionaire playboy turned armored hero. The film editing is as slick as Stark's engineering prowess, seamlessly building the arc reactor of a narrative that powers the entire MCU. Strengths? The origin story done right, giving us not just a superhero but a flawed and charming human beneath the metal suit. Weaknesses? The plot occasionally veers into predictable territory, but it's forgivable when the repulsor beams start firing. The music, Ramin Djawadi's score, is the sonic blueprint of heroism, turning every suit-up sequence into a symphony of metal on metal. Cinematography captures the glitzy tech world and the gritty reality of Stark's transformation, creating a visual feast for comic book enthusiasts. The message? A reminder that even the most brilliant minds can find redemption in doing good for the world. 8/10 is an Iron Man armor-grade salute to its game-changing brilliance, a film that not only kickstarted a cinematic universe but also made us believe in heroes in high-tech armor.","10/10"
"Iron Man","veensepeper","29 November 2014","After seeing the first 'Iron Man' again recently, I can't believe how far the MCU has strayed from this. The one that started it all, and it is hard to believe it takes place in the same universe as other Marvel movies - such as Guardians of The Galaxy.Although 'Iron Man' definitely has its fantastic elements, it is all grounded into a deep level of realness. And in keeping it real lies the refreshing bit. The realness makes the funny more funny, the amazing more amazing, and the emotional more emotional. And due to how much the movie is grounded in reality, you'll believe a man can fly.Arms-manufacturer Tony Stark is captured by terrorists, who appear to own several of his creations. After his escape, Stark turns a new leaf, shutting down the weapons department of his company. Instead of building weapons of destruction, he becomes a vigilant knight in shiny armor (with lasers and repulsors).All in all, it is a very good origins story. The acting by Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Palthrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges is outstanding - the witty dialogue alone makes for a good movie.Not only is 'Iron Man' the start of an Iron Man franchise, it is also the birth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie brings up a lot of key elements for the later to appear Avengers movie: Enter Iron Man. Enter the Arc Reactor. Enter Agent Coulson. Enter S.H.I.E.L.D. And do stay and watch until the end of the credits, for something that created massive nerd-gasms back in the day.","9/10"

I felt very entertained the whole way throigh, remember to stick sround for that post credit scene if you're new to Marvel.Highly recommend! Now continue the MCU adventure.","6/10"
"Iron Man","merdiolu","22 October 2008","One asks himself what if Marvel or DC Comics did not exist what would become Hollywood ? I mean once had been cradle of art and creativity these studios are throwing their resources , talents and investments to make clichéd worn out predictable comic book adaptations nowadays. In a few instances they are OK in artistic sense due to talented acting , decent and deep characterization and finely balanced dramatic writing with CGI or special effects are as required nothing more nothing less. (no matter how impressive they are)Unfortunetely Iron Man does not belong to this category. This is a movie produced and edited as a video clip. It has every cliché imaginable expected from a big but empty headed Hollywood blockbuster inspired from comic book aimed for 15 year olds. Cartoonish characters , sterile environment , lots of CGI , lame jokes/humor , unbelievably silly story (he made a super powerful weapon suit inside a cave ? PLEASE !!!) , hot chicks , fast cars , US Army being source of goodness around the world , swarthy Middle Eastern looking like bad guys who are evil just sake of it ( and getting their asses kicked of course as always) , an arch villain who boasts a lot , a final boss level showdown where superhero thriumps without any cost or after consequence....I understand there are lots of fans of that kind of things but frankly I am bored with them...I can endure even ignore clichés or predictability if movie presented something new , unique or original...Nope everything went down exactly I predicted above.....As for acting it is hit and miss really...Robert Downey Jr. shows a really decent performance here since his character Tony Stark is the center of story. Unfortunetely his character is nothing more than a Bruce Wayne wannabe. Mrs Patrow is usual damsel in distress...Jeff Bridges is usual uber nemesis without maniacal laugh or mustache twirling (he does have a beard though) Terence Howard is just awful. He doesn't have even a slight military presence....I see this as a trend....Comic book superhero adaptations just aimed to entertain and please fans of genre or very young or sub educated people who can be dazzled with CGI , explosions and awful characterization/dialog. Due to money making reasons (undeniable result of Hollywood becoming an industry to make profit) it is a popular trend now but this is not cinema.....I do not see a future for Iron Man (in creative sense) except a few sequels then audience will probably shift to next superhero like Superman , Spider Man , Hulk , Fantastic Four etc or its sequel/remake....They are basically same unfortunately...","8/10"
"Iron Man","Otterman_MK2","8 August 2012","Typically Iron Man is not the type of superhero movie I would enjoy, the only 'light' superhero movies I have genuinely enjoyed in the past being the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. With Christopher Nolan's dark realistic Batman movies paving the way of example to other films in the superhero genre, director Jon Favreau embraces a realistic tone whilst keeping the movie far lighter and more humorous in tone than Batman. And like most, I was pleasantly surprised with Iron Man, and despite its notable flaws, the film has made its way to being one of my favourite superhero films of all time. The film is, first and foremost, a long title sequence telling the origin story of Iron Man, the film's key fundamental theme being about realisation and – for past sins. In this case, the sins of billionaire playboy Tony Stark, played by the perfectly-cast Robert Downey Jr. Tony Stark is an arrogant, but made very likable due to Robert Downey Jr.'s fine performance, who is kidnapped by terrorists using the weapons he created, and imprisoned in a cave where he is forced to build a deadly weapon- The Jericho Missile- to help the terrorists in their plot. During this time, Stark is given a wake-up call in which he realises he must take responsibility for the power these terrorists hold, having previously been blindingly ignorant to what is being sold on the black market. There is a bittersweet irony in, not only the realisation that the terrorists gained power through his creations, but the fact that Tony's heart was injured by one of his own weapons- an injury which requires him to wear a power cell-like 'arc reactor' to keep him alive for the rest of his life. This makes not only for an interesting story, but a great motivation for Tony Stark to fight this evil, and a motivation the audience can feel equally enthusiastic about. As the films progresses and Tony returns to his home in America, the story continues the same concept by revealing more about how Stark's company has supplied these terrorists with weapons, but refuses to go in any other direction. For a summer blockbuster the storyline is lacking in fuel to keep itself going, the current story- that feels more like a concept, designed as an excuse to put Tony in the Iron Man suit and place a few action scenes in the film- wears down quickly, leading to a messy Transformers-like climax which feels out of tone with the rest of the film. The action scenes themselves were impressive, with incredibly realistic CGI on the Iron Man suit, beautiful cinematography and were genuinely adrenaline-fuelled fun, with exception to the clunky finale. However, the scenes were rationed throughout the films, appearing as a quick 'rush' in the film's pacing, before reverting back to a regular movie. Appreciating Jon Favreau's comfort zone and experience lies in the field of comedy, it was a good safe decision to ration the action scenes like he did, but the fact that they were so fun to watch and well-shot left me wanting more.The strength of the film really lies in Tony's physical and metaphorical transformation into Iron Man and the chemistry between the three central characters- Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges villainous Obadiah Stane. All three give top-class performances, and prevent the movie's pacing from falling flat. Composer Ramin Djawadi's score for the film is also highly commended, giving a suitable mixture of modern and orchestral, reflecting the film's swapping between Tony Stark and Iron Man/ smaller scenes and action scenes. Ultimately it feels very special, adds a good dose of humour and enjoys itself whist taking the core themes seriously, features great acting, but really could have done with a better ending than two people in suits engaging in a fist-fight.","9/10"
"Iron Man","dragonmysterious","1 May 2013","Before this film, Iron Man was only known amongst comic book fans. This film did a great introduction to Iron Man. Iron Man's origins is based very closely on the comics and done very well.Robert Downey is perfect for the role of Iron Man. Without the suit, its basically Robert playing himself. The film took its time and did not rush through its plot. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane was pretty well done too. This film was a great set-up and showed that it is a great idea to introduce more less-well-known superheroes among the public. The film took its time to show Iron Man learning to use the suit like Spider-man, but in its own unique way. It does a great job of foreshadowing future plots like ""The Ten Rings"" and Rhodey looking at a suit and be like ""Maybe next time"". The comedic elements supported the plot well. In conclusion, this film lives up to its expectations for comic book fans, and introduced a new character, or specifically, a new franchise to movie fans/non-comic book fans. Though not as epic as Nolan's Batman films which have a darker tone, this is a good family film and it is very enjoyable.","9/10"
"Iron Man","dbborroughs","4 May 2008","I loved it...do you need more than that? Okay the comic geek who red a huge chunk of every appearance of the character was pleased in spirit if not in action. Like the first time we saw and heard Wolverine's claws come out in the first X-Men movie, the moment that kind of sold me was when the camera pulls back to reveal Tony's mansion-and it was Tony's mansion (Later the comic book team Avengers' west coast headquarters). At that point I knew it was all okay, at that moment the geek went away and said they got it right and calmed down.yea its an origin story and yea you know how its going to come out- but the neat thing is there is a sense of danger, that everything may not be okay-hey Tony is injured in the opening minutes so you know he can and will be hurt. I love that its an origin story that hasn't been done to death-thank god Ironman was never Spiderman so his origin was never the stiff of endless spoofs and rip offs. Best of all I love the characters. All of the characters are there and they are real. Sure there is slight modification for the real world but they are there and you care about them- so much so that the action almost seems like an intrusion into the rest of the film. I especially liked Jeff Bridges as Obediah Stane. At last he gives a real performance and not one of his lispy toss off appearances of late. Here we have a wonderful evil man.I don't want to spoil it by saying too much...If I have any complaints- and there are two- its first that the film is almost too breezy. Its moves like the wind from start to finish with Robert Downey giving one hell of a central performance (He holds it all together). However the problem is that the meat seems to be missing-or at least invisible. Yes I know its not needed but I would have loved to have seen more of the back stories and subplots hinted at and that bleed off the screen. I love that the world and the people all exist outside the film-however I wished we could have seen more(though I know that would have slowed or killed the flow of the film). My second complaint is that the effects are at times too CGI. Its not so much the look- but the weight-when we see the later suits in action they don't have a real world weight. Its a nit pick, but it bothered me that such a wonderfully fun film missed something so tiny.Still I loved it- 9 out of 10 on the pure fun scale. No it ain't high art but it is a great thrill ride-and as for the post credits bit- Oh yea I'm there.","10/10"
"Iron Man","gargamel_gargamel","8 May 2008","Ironman, huh? Never heard of the premise.... though I assume it was a Marvel comic at some point. So I had no expectations going in other than I like Downey Jr and Jeff Bridges... so it had that going for it already. And it looked fun.Fun it is. The acting from these 2 guys was good. I caught myself hearing hints of The Dude in Jeff Bridges sometimes, but any Big Lebowski fan is going to pick that out..... it is unavoidable! He pulled it off excellently. Jr did very well with his part and was mostly very believable. I was impressed with Paltrow. She usually doesn't do it for me, but she looked unbelievably sexy in this role, especially the charity event scene with the backless dress (you'll see). Oh, and she did a good job with the acting also.The story is pretty good.... and like I said... fun. There are parts that dragged on a little bit, especially at the beginning. I thought the movie would have been better had it been about 20 minutes shorter. There were parts when I was thinking... okay, I know what's going on, let's just move on to the next scene already. However, like I said... more towards the beginning. Once the story gets rolling it keeps you interested. There are some great action scenes, you just have to put aside your logic for the flying stuff... but... it's a comic book so....On the Gargamel scale it gets 1 for story 1 for acting 1 for car chase (but it's more of an air chase, and it's cool) 1.5 for guns/explosions and 0 for the nudity score... there is not full nudity but there is some implication that is pretty sexy.. wow, so that's a 4.5 which equates to a 9 on the IMDb scale. I'm surprised myself..","2/10"
"Iron Man","Lejink","24 July 2009","Actually, I feel quite well qualified to rate this movie as, being a big comic-book fan (although more DC than Marvel!), I'd digested Marvel's ""Essential Iron Man"" re-print of all the early Stan Lee penned Iron Man comics just before this film appeared. Given my belief that, with few exceptions, movie-goers (at least mature ones like me, I suspect) prefer less crash-bang action in their super-hero flicks and more characterisation and plot, (which you invariably tend to get in origin-type stories), this film is all the better for being of that ilk.It has plenty of faults too though, which I'll get off my chest post-haste. Firstly, whilst respecting that the original Iron Man comic creation was born at the time of the Cold War and doesn't shy away from painting Iron Man's enemies as often originating from Red China or Soviet Russia, while this is okay in comicdom, I was uneasy at setting what is basically a super-hero confection in war-torn Afghanistan, especially at this particular time with the conflict far from over and US & UK casualties rising.Secondly, Iron Man isn't the most original of heroes, borrowing the playboy image of Batman's Bruce Wayne and the humanitarian angst of Spider Man's Peter Parker. Also, the movie gets off to a fairly unpleasant start, with an unnecessary rock soundtrack in tow, with a gratuitous celebration of mega-rich Stark's opulent lifestyle, where women are just ""what's your name again"" objects of desire or easy conquest, as even a hard-nosed but attractive journalist falls too easily for Stark's dubious charms.Thirdly, there's Gwynneth Paltrow who non-acts her way throughout as Stark's ""Miss Moneypenny"", Pepper Potts, who in the comics blossoms from prim & proper secretary to a dazzling beauty, which certainly doesn't happen here. And yes I could have done without the sub-Transformers action climax between Iron Man Marks 1 & 2, but I guess you have to give the teens something to watch at the finish. Strange also to see Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan restricted to almost ""extra"" status - in the comics he's every bit as important to Stark as Pepper and indeed is jealous of her feelings for Stark. Ironically this part is, I see, played by director Favreau himself! And yes, while it's de rigeur for blockbusters like this, the in your face product placement does grate (Audi & McDonald's prominent amongst them).On the plus side though, there's Robert Downey, cool as anything in the lead role. Thankfully he rarely dons the Iron Man armour so he gets to act a lot, definitely a plus. Ditto an almost unrecognisable, let's be generous, somewhat filled out Jeff Bridges as Stark's double-dealing mentor Obadiah Stane. The dialogue is invariably snappy and quick-fire, with occasional stabs of humour permeating through. I do feel though the director missed out on a possibly humorous King King moment as Stane, by now having his Doctor Octopus moment in donning the recreated prototype Iron Man armour, menaces Paltrow's Potts. The closing revelation by Stark as to his alter ego is also up there with Indiana Jones shooting of the ""whipmaster"" in the surprise stakes, certainly I don't recall Stark revealing his identity in the comics.Best of all though is the armour, which films great in burnished red and gold. Downey's extended scenes where he attempts to master his equipment are probably the best in the film and the special effects in general are at the top-end of the scale.So there you have it, another successful addition to Hollywood's roster of comicdom and no doubt a relief to Mavel after the comparative failure of big name dramatisations like Daredevil, The Hulk (twice) and the Fantastic Four.","8/10"
"Iron Man","ossie85","6 April 2023","Iron Man, now 15 years old (I'm old), is an excellent movie that introduced the world to Tony Stark, the billionaire industrialist who builds a pimped out suit of iron and transforms into a superhero. The film was a game-changer and revolutionized the superhero movie genre, and how to create an interconnected universe.The acting in this film is top-notch, led by Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark as an arrogant, quick-witted, and charming hero. Downey perfectly captures the character's transformation from a selfish and ruthless businessman to a hero who is willing to put his life on the line to save others. I still believe Downey deserved recognition at the Oscars for his iconic portrayal.The storyline is very engaging, with a perfect blend of humor, action, and emotion that set the tone for over a decade worth of movies. The direction by Jon Favreau is excellent, and the special effects are impressive. The film manages to balance the spectacle of the explosions and action scenes with the depth of the characters and their relationships.The supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as James Rhodes, and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, are all excellent and bring depth to their respective roles. A pity Howard didn't return, and that Bridges is a one and done character.Overall, Iron Man is a must-watch for fans of the superhero genre. The movie is well-crafted, entertaining, and manages to be both fun and meaningful. Iron Man truly set the tone for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it still stands as one of the best superhero movies of all time.","9/10"

The story just felt like another typical superhero story and I kind of wanted to stop watching the movie halfway through. I know it's obviously supposed to be a fiction movie, but it didn't feel realistic how Tony made the Iron Man costume and it felt like lazy writing. A positive I can think of is that I thought the action scenes were decent.","8/10"
"Iron Man","rbrb","14 May 2008","The special effects in this picture are good but not much else worth saying that about this movie. It is made for people with juvenile minds or for those who take comfort in reading comics. The plot so called is about a super rich and clever arms' dealer who decides that he will create an iron 'superman' to fight what he perceives to be injustice. Where this movie errs badly it is pure and ridiculous science fantasy yet it brings in real life war torn Afghanistan and starts preaching politics and other self interested propaganda. The lead actor and actress are totally miscast and are wholly unconvincing; she thinks by just posing she is putting in a decent performance which she does not, and he is no hero and neither acts nor looks the part.

"Iron Man","thesar-2","10 January 2010","I really wanted to reward one of the best superhero movies with a higher rating than just 8/10 stars, but each time I've seen this (now on the 5th time,) I can't get past the two major flaws and one scene, though incredibly original, I didn't personally 100% care for.Let's get the negatives out of the way, because the positives thoroughly outweigh the minor downfalls of Iron Man. #1: The story is just too damned old, familiar and makes it not only predictable, but very A-B-C. #2: The so-called ""villain"" is so foreseen, even for the first viewing, that it's funny they should even put in the ""surprise"" scene. The scene that was original, but I'm on the fence with, was the last few seconds of the film. It's hard not to give away the spoiler, but since the trailer for Iron Man 2 specifically lays it out, it's Stark (Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity.I grew up on superheroes, namely, Superman, and one of my favorite aspects, if not the #1, is the secret identity part. Of course it can be considered unrealistic – uh, glasses and the farm-boy stance hardly makes Superman invisible, especially to his ""incredibly brilliant and reporter"" partner. So, I'll give it to Iron Man as it would be hard not to put two-and-two together and they were doing just that in the finale's press conference. But, now the fun's gone and I strongly worry, though still curious, about the direction part two's going to take.Okay, glad that's over. The #1 best thing about Iron Man: Downey Jr. He made this movie. Literally without him, this would be just another run of the mill Superhero film. His wit, depth and incredibly funny one-liners shoot this film up to the top 10 (if not 5) best superhero movies. In addition, Paltrow did a great job (up to her nervous fumbling in the closing) of bouncing very nicely off him, as he did with the robots, as well. Bridges, as much as I like him, wasn't a great part of the film. I wouldn't go as far as to say he was miscast – on the contrary, for the character he played, he did fit the part. But, he was just, well, there. Nothing special. Howard's the same and I'm not sad to see him go for the second movie.Back to Downey Jr. If the opening hilarious ""taxi"" ride doesn't grab you with his humor, stance and instant charisma, you might as well turn the movie off. Sure, the action's good, in fact, most of its great, but I strongly believe he made the movie.Stark is an alcoholic, rich, spoiled, womanizing, sarcastic and incredibly smart engineer who heads up his deceased father's weapon company until he gets a change of ""heart"" while captured, tortured and forced to break free with the Iron Man 1.0 model. After the initial transformation of Stark (inside and out) the movie plays out like almost every other superhero/comic book origin story – again, with the exception of the phenomenal performance of Downey Jr.Not my favorite superhero – like I said, I like the change the superhero has to QUICKLY go through to save the day and here, like Batman, it's a long drawn out process. (I will say this though, they must've known people might have a problem with that because they made it sincerely interesting, despite time-consuming.) But, they definitively got a new fan here to the decades old hero.I do look forward to #2 as well as any kind of Avengers movie with Iron Man – as long as Downey Jr. plays Stark. I can't imagine anyone else stepping into those ""not-really"" Iron Shoes. (I could see them cutting costs on that Avengers movie with Iron Man now played by Freddie Prinze Jr. Save your role-stealing to Jack Bauer. Another character you'll never replace.)","10/10"
"Iron Man","Scars_Remain","4 May 2008","A lot of people have been raving that this is 2008's best movie, and while it very well may be so far, the year isn't even half over yet so we'll just have to wait and see. Iron Man is an amazing film that blew me away. I thought I was going to be let down because of all the hype but it's become one of my favorite super hero movies. So if you're wondering if it lives up to all the hype, the answer is a very enthusiastic ""yes."" I was very impressed with the storyline and I loved how well everything was tied together. A lot of super hero, and just action films is general, seem to focus so much on action sequences that they don't really have much time to focus on story and this movie wasn't like that at all. It created a great story. The acting was fantastic also. Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow and everyone else were amazing. I also thought the CGI and special effects were done very well. I usually hate CGI but I really loved the look of it in this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie.I am a big fan of the first Spiderman, the Batman films, the X-Men films, and Superman films and this one definitely deserves to be placed with those. It is the best super hero movie to come along lately and I can't till it's on DVD so I can purchase it. Go see it while it's still in theaters and for once, believe the hype!","10/10"
"Iron Man","MrGKB","8 May 2008","...thanks to a remarkably coherent script from four guys (usually a sign of last-minute rewrites and trouble in River City), some seriously immaculate production and visual design (from outfits like The Orphanage, ILM, and Stan Winston Studio), and most of all a sterling performance from Robert ""Weird Science"" Downey, Jr. as genius mega-tycoon Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Downey has had quite the roller-coaster career, and ""Iron Man"" is going to be one of its peaks, no question. He's pitch perfect, occupying the role like nobody's business, and although his transition from smug, self-involved war profiteer to conscience-stricken humanitarian seems little more than a pragmatic result of nearly being done in by his own weaponry, and leaves the audience wondering just how naive this wunderkind is in the first place, Downey plays the absurdity of it all with both good-natured relish and a certain restraint.Director Jon ""Elf"" Favreau elicits more than competent performances from the rest of his cast as well. Gwyneth ""Proof"" Paltrow fills Stark's gal Friday ""Pepper"" Potts' shoes with grace and a smoldering promise of things yet to come in the inevitable sequel (get your free hint at the end of the credits reel), while Jeff ""Starman"" Bridges genially gobbles scenery as the bad guy. Terrence ""Hustle & Flow"" Howard is somewhat wasted as Stark's military insider, and Leslie ""Popular"" Bibbs has little to do beyond look good as a bimbo journalist with a brain (Brown? Color me bemused!), but Shaun ""Crash"" Toub is excellent as Stark's savior in Afghanistan, and Clark ""We Were Soldiers"" Gregg will no doubt enjoy more to do as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent under the command of Samuel L. Jackson.Anyway, as the first genuine blockbuster of the summer, ""Iron Man"" serves perfectly. Plenty of action, but not tiringly so, a script that mostly treats its characters intelligently and with a sense of humor that never condescends, outstanding production values, and even a score that never overwhelms nor tries to elicit emotional response that isn't otherwise deserved; what more can one ask? I haven't had this much fun since ""Spider-Man"" or ""Batman Begins,"" and I'll be back in the theater to see this one again, soon, if only to prep for ""The Incredible Hulk"" (in which Stark/Iron Man will apparently make at least a cameo appearance).Cynics may object to the de rigueur ""sci-fience"" that ""Iron Man"" relies upon to exist, but that doesn't make the film any less entertaining or worthy of seeing on the big screen. Don't miss it!","8/10"
"Iron Man","skoobydoo6789","23 April 2015","When Iron Man came out in 2008, I didn't know much about the character except that he was a Marvel comic book character created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. After watching the movie, I fell in love with Iron Man. He became one of my favorite comic book superheros along with Batman and the X-Men. The movie is the reason why I started collecting comic books and graphic novels. Iron Man 1 is an awesome start to what has become an amazing and well-loved franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Iron Man is a modern take on the origin story of Tony Stark and how he became Iron Man. Stark is the CEO of Stark Industries, a company that creates weapons which he inherited from his father, Howard Stark. Tony is a self-describe ""genius, playboy, billionaire, philanthropist."" While in Afghanistan, he is captured by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings who want him to build weapons for them to use. With the help of fellow prisoner, Yinsen, Stark creates a primitive suit of armor with some weapons and escapes. Because of his escape, Tony has a chance of heart and sets out to become a new hero called Iron Man.The movie does a brilliant job of keeping the audience entertained. It has a great cast. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect choice to play Tony Stark/Iron Man. He does such a good job that it's hard to separate the character from the actor. Iron Man has a great supporting cast like Jeff Bridges, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Terrance Howard. The movie has a great soundtrack, story-line, and special effects.Iron Man is one of the best superhero movies that I've seen in years. Everything about this movie is brilliant. It never gets old over time. Iron Man is starts the MCU with a bang. Definitely a comic book movie that everyone should watch.","9/10"
"Iron Man","Cocacolaguy912-2","3 May 2008","Iron Man was a great way to begin a new summer.One thing that is so refreshing about this film was the casting. The casting director did a perfect job. Robert Downey Jr. was a perfect choice for the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The Big Lebowski - Jeff Bridges - was a perfect villain. Gwyneth Paltrow was great even though I felt like she was trying to hard at some points. Then there was Terrence Howard, a good actor who isn't used enough.There has been some talk that Iron Man doesn't have enough action. I would not say that at all. Iron Man has quite a lot of action, it just also has a story and character development.The action, by the way, is very good.Definitely set itself up for a sequel...","7/10"

They fight. The story of Steve Jobs versus Bill Gates?; no, Tony Stark vs. Obadiah Stane or really Iron Man vs bald Jeff Bridges with facial hair cut in menacing way not like he had it in The Big Lebowski. Without short-changing the movie, that pretty much wraps up the plot and it doesn?t even take that much of Iron Man to dispense with Iron Man-wannabee. There was an attempt at building a morale to the story but I think it was something like weapons are bad and super-weapons are like?worse.? The real draw here is to see Robert Downey, jr. as a superhero. As daft as that concept sounded before I saw the film, Downey is Iron Man or rather Tony Stark: drunk, overindulged, immature and following in his father?s footsteps. As someone I discussed the movie with said: ?it takes a wealthy cocaine addled playboy to really capture a wealthy, alcoholic playboy?. Jeff Bridges is also not who you would think of as super-villain material but apparently he can play anything well. Seriously, when the last thing you say him in when he wasn?t believable? In short, this was an entertaining way to kill off two hours on a Friday night.","10/10"

Definitely recommend.Good: Robert Downey Jr does an absolutely phenomenal job as the star character and has left his mark on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When he leaves, he shall be missed greatly. Gwyneth Paltrow is pretty good as Pepper Potts as are Terrence Howard and Clark Gregg as Rhodes and Coulson respectively. Jeff Bridges is excellent as Obadiah Shane even if his character was pretty poor. The story itself was pretty good and well written and (along with Batman Begins) shows an origin story can be excellent. It is funny when it needed to be and one particular joke had me almost in tears. The action was great and looked bad-ass. I loved the ending and its rapid cut to black was a very good call. Special effects, cinematography and music were all pretty good. Bad: Despite a great performance, the villain himself was pretty weak and could be spotted from a mile off within seconds of meeting him. The finale had little build up and was just tacked in to make it qualify as an action movie. The final defeat of the villain was lazy and it would have been better with the first method.Best Part: Tony Stark's first proper outing as Iron ManMVP: Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man9/10","9/10"
"Iron Man","inkblot11","6 August 2008","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the head of a large firm that makes devastating weapons of warfare. His father, who founded the company, was responsible for the A-bomb, among other achievements, and he schooled his genius son in the ""fine"" art of making killing devices. Now, Stark has rock-star status in the world, for he is also very handsome and rich. On a trip to Afghanistan, with Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) as a guide, Stark shows the Allied Forces his newest creation. All of a sudden, the company is ambushed and Stark is taken prisoner. Once in captivity, a fellow scientist saves his life by implanting a mechanical device in his heart, for the shrapnel that remains in his body could kill him. Now, the Afghan meanies want Stark to re-create his latest weapons for them and give him any materials he requests, within reason. But, in his new laboratory-cave, Stark instead develops a unique bit of armor that can withstand almost any attack. Naturally, with this metallic suit, he breaks out of his prison and gets rescued, nevertheless leaving bits and pieces of the armor behind. Once back in Malibu, he informs the press that his company won't be making any more weapons. This angers his longtime co-worker, Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) and puzzles his ultra-efficient personal assistant, Pepper Potts (Gywneth Paltrow). In secret, Stark begins to work on a new suit of armor that will far surpass his original work. Thus, he becomes ""Iron Man"", a human with the ability to fly and take out the bad guys. Will he save the world? This is an excellent, excellent film, one of the best, if not the BEST, of 2008. First, the cast is terrific. Downey's great manic abilities are slightly in check but he delivers his lines with energy, humor, and compassion. As such, he is one of the most likable comic book heroes ever put up on the screen. Bridges, too, is a marvel, as he totally ""hides"" in his role as the supposed friend who crosses over into the dark side. He should most definitely receive an Oscar nomination for his work. As for Paltrow, she is beautiful, intelligent, wry, and touching, nicely balancing the mostly male cast with her strong showing. Howard is one great sidekick and the rest of the cast, although mostly unknowns, are very fine. One must mention that the costumes and sets are wonderful, too. As for the special effects, the script/story, and the direction, they are absolutely mind-blowing and will transfix almost any audience out there. In short, my advice is to go, and go now, to arrange a showing, for this is one of the best ""big-money"" movies ever made.","9/10"
"Iron Man","rauh-georg","15 September 2008","This is another ""run-off-the mill"" marvel/superhero movie without ANY new twists or any originality.The plot could have been written by a 6 year old.Take known elements off robocop, terminator, spiderman and mix it together to make a ""new"" movie where everything is ultra-predictable, except that those other known"" superheros like robocop or terminator are certainly better in their class while the iron man just excels in mediocrity.The main character has not enough charisma to be like-able by the audience, unlike a hero, say ""spiderman"" with its weaknesses and odd characteristics. The story line is simple and, excuse me, not logical or credible.The only good part of the movie was the special effects, mainly the scenes with the iron man flying...but there are other comparable movies where such things have been done better already.Of course...since we're dealing with a ""run-off-the-mill"" superhero movie...add the obligatory villain end fight...add some non-logical solution so our ""hero"" at the ends prevails (""just push the bypass button"")...villain dies....and everyone can go home happy after wasting two hours with this Luke-warm re-wash of things we've seen 100 times already. What about such a movie should be worth giving it 8 points? Nothing.

"Iron Man","Puroo","9 May 2021","I had no interest in superhero movies until the release of Avengers: Infinity War. I had decided to watch all the MCU movies so that I could catch up before Endgame releases. This was the very first one in the list and also the very reason why I stuck on this franchise, because I knew that if the very first movie had so much to offer, I'd really be in for some good time with all these movies. And since this movie attempted to do something new (that I'll talk about later), Tony Stark already became my favourite MCU character.First of all, the acting in this movie is superb. I've heard people say that Robert Downey Jr's acting is quite mediocre, but here I felt as though it was terrific. He actually feels like he's the character. If he wanted he didn't have to do the finger snapping thing while waiting for Jarvis to download the data for the suit upgrades, he didn't have to sound nonchalant every time something great happened and he didn't even have to make those quirky one liners in every scene. But he still did all of that. And with just that personality combined with character development he managed to completely steal the show.Alongside the acting another thing that made this movie great is the idea. Until now we used to see superheroes to be like ""I have to keep my identity a secret UwU"". But this is finally the movie where the superhero comes in front of the press and says ""I'm Iron Man!"". Also the superheroes are shown to have very high morals who can never be wrong and inspire other people to be like them. You will never expect them to be self centred and care-free. Of course nowadays this is rapidly becoming an idea of showing superheroes to be morally corrupt, but this isn't what this movie is saying. It's just a man with a super suit who fights bad people entirely out of his own choice without any concern of what others say.The CGI and cinematography is another thing that makes this movie so great. If you just see the plot, what is there? A man gets attacked by terrorists, he builds a suit to save himself, he upgrades it and becomes the superhero, the bad guy who wants to take over the world finds out his old suit, hero-villain fight, hero wins, roll credits. Most of this was shown in the trailer itself. But what mainly carries it is the visual appeal and tone, something that MCU movies are still replicating (Captain Marvel smh). It is fun to see Iron Man just do something on the big screen. It's so visually satisfying to see him failing the designs and trying to fix them. Even the scene in which Stane pulls Iron Man's Arc Reactor was scary, but fun to watch.But of course this movie isn't without its fair share of flaws. For starters the movie seems to be taken way too lightly. Iron Man kills all those terrorists but faces no consequences. Iron Man flies among US Army but faces no consequences (sure he does reveal he's Iron Man in the end but before that it's very little). The movie also spends time showing Tony's life before and after being Iron Man that it just seems like padding the runtime, although the padding makes the movie somewhat comfortable to watch. Like I mentioned above, this movie severely lacks content. Pepper learning about Stane being the villain was also a very ""Oh no! Anyway..."" type reveal.Iron Man is a perfect origin story that is satisfying to watch and also something fun. It's a good thing that this is the first movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, since there are many movie franchises where the first movie itself is bad (The Fast and the Furious, Transformers, Fantastic Four, Mortal Kombat etc). I'm glad I made this decision. Back when I saw this movie, Iron Man had become my favourite superhero. I used to talk and act like Tony Stark, that's the impact it left on me.","8/10"

Gwenyth Paltrow was great (and great-looking) as Pepper, and Jeff Bridges played a pretty good villain. The first time I saw this movie I was shocked at how he turned from Tony's mentor to nemesis without even thinking about it.Also, Favreau did an excellent job with the story, which I won't spoil here. Would have been nice to see more of Tony's past, but they left that for future films. Still the best Iron Man movie; Marvel could not have started off their Cinematic World in a better way.9/10","8/10"

The change of direction displeases Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who tries to use Tony's tech against him to seize control of the company after trying to get him killed and removed failed. It was action packed and Downey and Bridges played off each other brilliantly. Without this film the MCU doesnt take off","9/10"
"Iron Man","immortal74205","30 April 2008","When I first heard that there was going to be an Iron Man movie, I was skeptical. Some of the recent origin story comic book movies have been mediocre at best. The Fantastic Four and Hulk are the first two that come to mind. Batman Begins, Spider-Man and Superman were a few of those rare treats where it was done well. Iron Man is one that is difficult to do because of all of the technology involved, not only in the Iron Man suit himself, but because of the fact that the story deals with state of the art technology developed by billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.).Director Jon Favreau hit this one out of the ballpark, making Iron Man an overnight sensation to those who were not familiar with him in the first place. This film is also the first movie to be released under the new Marvel Studios banner. Before, Marvel worked in concert with studios like Warner Bros. and Paramount to produce their properties, but this is the first to be solely made by Marvel, and then distributed by a major film studio, in Iron Man's case, Paramount Pictures.This is one of the first superhero comic book movies that I can think of where a well-known actor who is playing the title role, actually does a good job. Does anyone remember Daredevil, or dare I mention again, Hulk. Besides Downey playing the title character, Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the cast. Paltrow actually gives a decent performance as Stark's secretary Pepper Potts, and isn't too annoying like both Katie Holmes was in Batman Begins, and Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns. Howard plays Stark's best friend Jim Rhodes, a military officer who eventually finds out about Stark's 'new toy' and covers for him when his own fighters accidentally engage him, thinking he's an enemy bogey. Just from some of the events in the film, it appears evident that Howard might be back for the sequel, possibly dawning the second suit to become War Machine.Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's mentor and partner in Stark Industries. Not only was he a friend of his father, but he helped Stark build his empire by selling weapons to the U.S. military. Of course Stark doesn't know that someone has been selling his weapons to third world nations as well, to use against the U.S. military. It is partially because of this that Stark starts to build the Iron Man suit and help get his company's weapons back in the hands of the U.S.The battle between the large Mark I and the Mark III (red and yellow suit) is pretty good. It doesn't get dragged out too long and it keeps you entertained. The film has lots of elements of humor, all used in appropriate places. Most of them revolve around Stark's sarcastic attitude to his friends and his inventions (he talks to his machines in his lab).There are plenty of shock and awe fanboy moments as we see the armor for the first time on Mark I, and then the machine that puts the Mark III suit on Stark in his lab. It is probably one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Plus, be on the lookout for several agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. The ending is fantastic, with Stark saying probably the most anticipated line in the whole film, easily setting the stage for the eventual sequel.","8/10"
"Iron Man","bluesman-20","25 October 2008","Iron man great film. It is more faithful to the comic book that inspired it. Robert Downey JR is the film he hits the ground running from his first scene and never stops running, RDJ plays Tony Stark like a lazy Howard Hughes/James Bond wannabe with a little bit of Hugh Hefner tossed in. He does not lack confidence and he almost has a childlike naive way of looking at life. Until a life altering and threatening accident places him in the hands of terrorists who demand he create a weapon for them. Stark creates something but not for them he creates a Armor with enough weapon power to take out an army which he proceeds to do. once home he realizes that he must take account for his actions his company makes weapons of mass destruction he must make amends thus is born Iron man a avenger out to protect the world from those who terrorize and commit atrocities on a massive scale. Jeff Bridges is superb as Stane, Stark's partner who betrays him and creates the Iron Monger a suit more powerful then Iron man's. the battle scenes are breath taking and suspenseful This movie delivers on all cylinders and fulfills any Iron man fan they even play Black Sabbith's IRON MAN and you know the movie is going to be fun when it pokes fun of itself by playing it over and over again specially in the background. One thing I must admit is this . the director made a movie better then the comic from which it came. This movie is a family movie deep down in it's iron plated heart it delivers action some romance some development in the form of Tony Stark as he grows from a spoiled man who does not take any accountability whatsoever for his actions to a Iron Plated hero out to not only take responsibility for his actions but those of others as well. This movie left me wanting more Iron Man and hopefully soon.","7/10"

"Iron Man","Movie_Muse_Reviews","2 May 2008","It's time to suit up, because the comic film genre has a new face bringing it back to life and it's a shiny one. ""Iron Man"" delivers everything you want in a comic book-based film and is probably the best thing to happen to Marvel Studios since Spider-Man 2--that's nearly 4 years of a lot of money with disappointing delivery. A good start for the first film fully produced by the studio with no additional funding.Iron Man is not the most well-loved of Marvel characters, but at this point in the Marvel film universe, he feels like next logical step to give the comic company a boost in the right direction. The man is Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), a millionaire playboy in the arms dealing business. On a routine demonstration trip in Afghanistan (updated to the modern era), Stark is captured and held hostage by a rebel band of Afghanis who demand he build them one of his best missiles. Instead, Stark devises a plan to build a suit of armor so he can escape.A victim of the very weapons he created, Stark's uniqueness in comparison to other Marvel heroes Stan Lee has created is that he learns the error of his ways, his ignorance to the evil his industry produces, and the experience changes his perspective. It's not a vengeance story, it's one of personal redemption. Downey Jr. carries this film. Not entirely, but the film focuses more on his discovery and creation of Iron Man than it does on him being on Iron Man and fighting evil, a wonderful choice by the writers. Downey Jr.'s standard witty comedic acting fits this perfectly as finally there is a superhero with a sense of humor. ""Iron Man"" could be the funniest of all superhero films, or at least it certainly beats the awkward attempts of ""Spider-Man 3."" Marvel was way overdue for introducing a new character after the 3rd installments of the ""X- Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" franchises. An origin story, the reason why those other franchises took off, was in order. Those films were fantastic in many ways, but failed because they tried to do too much and ""Iron Man"" doesn't. The plot is straightforward. Now there have been other Marvel origin films ""Hulk"" and ""Daredevil"" for example, that fail as well. ""Iron Man"" is better than those films because it is so focused on Stark's character. This is interesting and fascinating because of the visual effects and the sheer creativity of those behind the concept of what his suit could actually do. A lot of scenes are test scenes and while not much is going on, they're really cool and captivating. There's no law that superheroes have to spend most of their time as the hero and fighting. ""Iron Man"" doesn't do that--it reserves that for the climax of the film and doesn't dwell there any longer than it must. You want more, but what you do get isn't bad.The supporting cast really helps too. Bridges in his first truly evil role as Stark's adviser turned-bad, Obadiah Stane, is great, Paltrow provides a nice change of pace as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts and even Terrence Howard is likable as Stark's friend and military ally, Jim Rhodes.The only thing to complain about ""Iron Man"" is that there wasn't enough. So much time, though rightly so, was spent on Stark's development of ""Iron Man"" that there wasn't enough room for more awesome action sequences in the suit and most disappointing of all, further thematic development, which is what made Spider-Man revolutionary. It's all there, but it doesn't get as much attention as it should. A second viewing might bring those themes home more.Jon Favreau should get incredible applause for outdoing the skepticism he unjustly received when it was first revealed he would be at the helm. There are plenty of treats for the comic book fans in this film and there's just a lot of great realism to this film than previous films too focused on great one-liners and the like, which is what someone like Favreau of the ""dude romantic comedy"" persuasion can bring to a genre in so much need of that normal/ human touch.","10/10"
"Iron Man","policy134","10 May 2008","How many superheroes can filmmakers drain to absolute dehydrated shells? Look what happened to the Superman movies (5 so far counting the most recent waste of time) and the Batman movies (Also 5, if you don't count the recently yet un-released swan song of Heath Ledger). Actually, Batman was reinvigorated with a new innovative director, superb story and brilliant actors who saw its potential.The same could be said for this the latest installment of what could have been a massive bore. The director, Jon Favreau, who is also an actor, had the stroke of genius to cast Robert Downey, Jr. in the part of zillionaire tycoon, Tony Stark. Downey, while not playing himself, clearly put some autobiographical stamp on his part which fit the character brilliantly. Tony Stark is a middle aged man who seizes the chance to redeem himself after a frightening wake up call (cue Downey's sordid past). Favreau also cast Gwyneth Paltrow and for once her character didn't make me want to spew vile as other female characters have done in lesser superhero flicks (eg. Uma Thurman in Batman bomb + Robin). One minor quibble, her character must be the loneliest person on earth besides Stark himself. No clear motivation as how she is attracted to him other than that.Jeff Bridges acquits himself nicely, although it is never explained how he is able to be a threat to Iron Man (see the climactic battle if you don't know what I mean). Also his mumbling performance is a bit tiresome after a while.The CGI is of course top-notch and quite unbelievable (really, where can you get such a supercomputer, let me know). There is a clever little sequence while Stark is perfecting his suit that mirrors a scene seen in Disclosure. As for the action sequences they are not that interesting, except for a glorious dogfighting sequence.So I was only mildly interested in seeing it but once it was over I thought: ""It could have been better but not the mind blowing bore I thought it was going to be"".","10/10"
"Iron Man","faded-77380","19 January 2022","Tony Stark is our man to the core. Just think, a multimillionaire and a brilliant inventor - there are a dime a dozen such heroes today. No, the main thing is that he is a womanizer and a drinker. In addition, he is absolutely not tormented by remorse about the means of mass destruction produced by his company.More precisely, it was so until Tony was captured by the evil dushmans, where he saw that his weapons, created to arm the American army, were being used very much against it. Fortunately, the bad Afghans underestimated the genius of our hero and allowed him to quietly assemble armored robotic armor of the MARK-1 type, thanks to which he showed the brats the uniform of Kuzkin's mother. That's how Iron Man appeared.And you can love him already at least for the fact that he is, in fact, to blame for the emergence of his superhero essence. No one killed his relatives, no mutated arthropods bit him either. He became what he became by reaping the fruits of his labors. Well, I just wanted to live, of course.The main success of the film adaptation was, of course, Robert Downey Jr. In the title role. It is clear why the role sits on him like a cast - the actor played almost himself, because in his youth he had a long pernicious affair with alcohol and drugs, but eventually broke himself and went on the right path. Recently, you can see more and more works of this magnificent actor; Tony Stark, of course, is not the best, but definitely one of them.Gwyneth Paltrow plays furniture. Drop the snide grins, and think about it properly: the Oscar winner plays furniture. They say she agreed solely because of the opportunity to work with Downey Jr. And, it should be noted, Pepper Potts in her performance is simply charming at times. Such an assistant is the cherished dream of many men, undoubtedly.You can also add a good script to the asset of the tape, evenly placing accents on different components of the story and not focusing on one thing. The energetic direction of Jon Favreau, which allowed you to never get bored for two hours. And, especially, a dashing soundtrack to match the whole action. It's a pity that ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" from the Filter team did not migrate from the teaser to the final version, but earlier I would not have been able to believe in the existence of a big-budget Hollywood movie in our time that would start with AC/DC and end with Black Sabbath.And about the effects, or what... and what kind of blockbuster is this - and without special effects? For the most part, everything is fine with them, but when Iron throws people in different directions, flying bodies with their unnatural animation give out the computer essence of themselves. But really something, and the suit itself came out just for a sight.And what do we have in the end? This movie doesn't have a maniacally reflective protagonist. And there is no throwaway pathos either. The main villain does not seem to have the idea of fixing the enslavement of humanity, and his opponent, in principle, does not keep in mind the desire to save the world from another universal evil. Everyone has their own small local tasks.That's why the film is very lightweight, it does not load the viewer's brains beyond measure, it is almost perfectly balanced. He, the Christmas trees are green, is just interesting in all its aspects. Yes, the movie came out a little loose, all its components seem to stick together, but if you remove, for example, humor, everything will instantly fall apart. However, this is exactly what makes the ""Iron Man"" a kind of charming dolt, spitting on generally accepted norms, but immediately endearing the viewer to himself.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Chris Knipp","15 May 2008","Is this story supposed to have political significance? In it Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the brilliant playboy scion of a megabucks American weapons manufacturer (are there cut-rate ones?), discovers that his company's products, which he ostensibly thought used to protect the US and preserve ""peace,"" are being supplied to some multinational bad guys in Afghanistan. To keep us guessing about who's being demonized this time, these blokes speak Egyptian Arabic, Dari, Pushtu, Hungarian, and after that I lost track. You wonder how they carry out their operations since they change languages every five minutes. Naturally their leader turns out to speak perfect English so he can spar verbally with Tony as the need arises.While Mr. Stark is held prisoner with a friendly foreign scientist, he's supposed to develop a super-rocket so the bad guys can take over the whole region if not the world, but miraculously he manages to conceal the fact that he's in fact not doing that at all but engineering a spectacular escape by cobbling together a giant robotic weapons-fitted iron suit out of scraps. That'll show them.Oh and by the way, Stark's chest got filled with shrapnel when the baddies captured him, so he's fitted first with a giant magnet to keep the lethal metal from going to his heart, and then some sort of artificial heart gadget. It's supposed to be a wonder but we're not to know how it works. All we know is that it gives out a luminous glow. It's the symbol that Tony himself, hitherto into life only for the pleasure it could give him, has acquired an ability to care. He rushes home, flying through the air being one of his suit's abilities, and after declaring his Stark Weapons Technologies out of the weapons business, begins devising a much more high tech and sleek version of the robotic suit thing, in red, and no longer made of iron but some sorts of miraculous alloys.There is a little of James Bond in Tony Stark. He likes to drink, he likes women, and frankly, up to now, he doesn't give a damn. On top of that he has wavy hair, a sharp mustache, a nice tan, and a fearsome intellect. His repartee is rapid fire and offhand and only occasionally mimics the delivery of Kevin Spacey. Remember Bond's blazing Astin Martin? This robotic suit thingy is some sort of grossly hypertrophied offshoot.There are two kinds of real fun in Iron Man for those who are patient enough to sit through all the wizard explosions and pointless political confusion. One is the dazzling special effects of Tony's private robot suit factory (he shares his process only with tool-manipulating robots that he handles with witty condescension). This stuff becomes most entertaining when Tony learns how to fly, with some nasty bumps along the way; but for gadget geeks the elegant complexity of the artificial limbs and head and the way they click miraculously onto Tony are equally pleasurable. The other fun thing is to see Bridges and Downey Jr. and Paltrow play off each other. Yes, real people can be fun in a movie too.It ought to be inexorably comic, since the concept of the robot suit donned by a man is such a literal expression of Bergson's definition of comedy--""the mechanical encrusted upon the living."" Only it isn't. Nor are obvious, perhaps much too obvious, implications about technology shielding man from his humanity, ever brought to light in this movie.Well, yet another comic book has been brought to multi-million-dollar screen life in Hollywood. Favreau has assembled an excellent cast and one stops wondering why they bother (for the money, yes?) when one sees how typically mercurial and witty Robert Downey Jr. is in the lead, how disconcertingly unpleasant Jeff Bridges becomes as Obadiah Stone, his would-be nemesis, and how appealing and present Gywneth Paltrow is in the neutral role of Tony Dare's (Downey's) girl Friday, Pepper Potts (cute name). Terrence Howard is wasted and too mild as some kind of air force commander who basically just works for the weapons company.You might wonder why Iron Man has done so well with adult film critics. Isn't this just adolescent fare given a mild gloss of adulthood and a heavy extra coat of S/X? But then you think of how much better this is than the competition, and you understand.","7/10"
"Iron Man","kaden_lewis","10 June 2021","This is it, the one that started it all, the entire MCU. This a a great movie to do so. It had a great story which nailed the origin of Tony Stark becoming Iron Man, and it had a great plot in general. I thought the casting was perfect, Robert Downey Jr. Is perfect to play Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper Potts. I also thought Jeff Bridges played a great Obadiah Stain, and Terrence Howard played James Rhodes pretty well. I am however happy Don Cheadle took over, I think he is a much better Rhodes.All in all, this movie is the perfect start to one of the best movie franchises of all time.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Ltufano23","2 January 2024","After seeing the success of their other superheroes on the big screen, Marvel Comics brings one of their original Avengers to the screen with Iron Man. Being relatively unknown to the wider masses at the time, the film tells the origins of billionaire Tony Stark donning the Iron Man suits. While the superhero origin movie has felt overplayed in the last few years, Iron Man still holds up a higher quality and feels truly well thought out in a way that has been lacking lately. Reviving his career, Robert Downey Jr. Fully encapsulates the character of Tony Stark and creates a figure that easily became a household name from his mix of charisma and heart. With visual effects that are unbelievably realistic, every action scene acts as a compliment to the captivating story and delightful acting. This film was lightning in a bottle at the perfect time, allowing an entire universe to be born out of it, while having fans invest deeply into it. Changing the future of superhero films forever, Iron Man introduced audiences to something truly special with a legacy that will not soon be forgotten.","9/10"
"Iron Man","filmbuff-05706","11 July 2020","Note: I am going to start with a lengthy introduction about my relationship with superhero movies. It is necessary for me to do this to properly give my thoughts on Iron Man. Please bear with me, thanks.I am 21 years old, a life-long film buff, and I once actually took the time to find out that I have seen over 1,125 movies. With this kind of enthusiasm for film, it may shock you that I saw Iron Man for the first time just last night. In fact, it's the 2nd movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I have seen-the first being Spider Man: Homecoming.You see, Iron Man came out on May 2nd, 2008. I was 9 at the time. There were very few superhero movies that really engaged me then. I can think of Tim Burton's Batman and Spider Man with Tobey Maguire, and I think the line ends there. The genre never really appealed to me, and just a few years ago I started gradually gaining a love for superhero flicks.When Avengers: Endgame released, my youth group was going to see it but I stayed behind when I realized how far behind I was in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like I said, I had only seen Spider Man Homecoming.Back in December, just a few days before Christmas, I bought the first 2 movies- Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. But even though I was gradually getting into superhero movies, I was struggling to get myself to sit down and watch Iron Man. I kept making excuses- I don't want to right now. I'll watch this movie instead. What if it falls into the weaker superhero movie category?I finally sat down last night and watched the movie. I laid on the couch, opened my mind....and turned on the subtitles. I notice with a lot of movies that the characters talk too softly and I need subtitles to get the dialouge, so I put that aside and focused on the movie.The plot follows Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.), a billonare weapon inventor who is kidnapped to build weapons for some terriosts. Instead, he builds a man made of metal and uses it to escape. He uses this invention afterwards for good, and then he needs it to fight Obadiah Stane(Jeff Brifdges), who doesn't like Stark's change of heart.The first positive thing I noticed about Iron Man was the cinematography. Iron Man is one of the most polished looking movies I've ever laid eyes on- it's bright, colorful, and even though it's 12 years old, it looks like it was made today.Iron Man contains some really nice and intense action, such as when Iron Man and Obadiah duke it out in the final act. Wherever Iron Man is in action, it's quite stunning to look at.There are also some comic relief moments that work well. The main example I can come up with is when Tony is testing his suit and it malfunctions in multiple amusing ways. Another was my favorite scene in the movie, where Pepper, Tony's assistant, helps him repair his heart's electromagnet. I won't explain that any further to avoid spoilers.When it comes to acting and other elements, Iron Man usually succeeds. However, there are a few flaws that make it a 9 and not a 10. I already mentioned that I found the dialouge to be quite soft, but I've seen 10s that have that problem, that's more a personal thing than an actual flaw.My biggest problem is a flaw I have with most superhero movies, even good ones. Here's the problem- the opening runs too long and the hero is more compelling than the man occupying it. The best superhero movies(Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight particularly) tell a deep story that makes us care about the hero as much as the man. In Iron Man, while Tony Stark is a compelling character, the movie was more engaging when he was in his red and yellow suit, which, by the way, happens in the middle of the movie.Also, like I said, Tony is kidnapped by terriosts. This takes up roughly a half hour of the movie, and while it is essential to the plot, it could have been cut down maybe 10-15 minutes at least. It runs too long and it made me anxious for the plot to drag less. However, the more the plot unfolds, the better the pacing gets.Iron Man also has many minor pleasures throughout for Marvel fans. Early in the movie, we see a cameo of Stan Lee at a party for Tony, so see if you can spot him! Near the end, Terence Howard's character alludes near the end that he will join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though this was changed to Don Cheadle.And, like all the movies, after all of the credits roll, there is a post-credits scene that teases future movies. This one gives a cameo with Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. I must confess that I took out the DVD after the cast credits, forgetting to watch that part, but I re-inserted the DVD just to see that 45 second clip. If you watch a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, don't forget to stay after the credits!A personal pleasure for me were the Biblical allusions. While they don't advance the story or anything, I smirked when Tony donates some money to a man dressed as Caesar, and quotes Matthew 22:21, saying: ""Render therefore unto Caesar what is Caesar's!"" There are references like this that I admired. Also, I don't know if this was planned, but the villain shares a name with an Old Testament prophet.So while I don't think Iron Man is a perfect movie, I do have a deep admiration for it. In fact, if I made a top 10 list of the superhero movies I have seen, Iron Man would probably make that list. As an introduction to the biggest franchise in Hollywood history, it's a decent start. I look forward to seeing more MCU movies and catching up with all the hype. Iron Man is a bright look into the cinematic future.","10/10"
"Iron Man","desert-jackets","14 September 2013","This amazing and mostly a kind of realistic movie is set by the plot in the way to keep you involved from beginning to the end. The most fascinating part that blew my mind off was the extraordinary special-effect. Don't be uncertain, this Iron Man is an entirely wonderful movie. I won't write any spoilers ti its reviews and would urge to watch this movie possibly if you still haven't watched it. Marvel must have made these types of movies long ago.As the name of Robert Downey is not amongst the biggest names in the Hollywood, he still played his role flawlessly and intimidated me how he represented Iron Man so greatly. Also the humor worked well in this movie. The script is perfect and it carries the wonderful cast.I was largely impressed by the CGI. They were magnificent and are not disturbing to make you miss great scenes of this movie. It is not possible to forget that this is an Action movie, so it's not that just the stars have to be congratulated; each individual effect was also fairly wonderful. The fighter jet scenes seemed very lame in Iron Man's trailer, but when I watched the full movie, it satisfied my expectations.This amazing full of special-effects Iron Man film has to offer you a thrilling ride particularly when it comes to the battle part. And no doubt, the credit for uplifting its ranking goes to Robert Downey who once an unknown character now a familiar personality. I like the technology of Iron Man which has the quality to avoid targeting people.The second half is full of pure action. The well-written script and enough twist-scenes are well delivered to keep you tighten with your seat till the end. This remarkable movie pleased everybody succeeded greatly. The whole 2.5 hours playing of this movie offers you latest action hero for the CGA sated appreciation. The best use of the amazing leather jackets has been made in this movie, especially by Robert Downy as Tony Stark in this movie. Until now, I was wondering if I could find one of those hangar scene leather jackets outside the Stark industry. Finally, I have found the solution to all my Hollywood style leather jackets needs. Desert leather is the wonderful online website that offers all Hollywood celebrity style genuine leather jackets at an attractive price with free shipping all across the USA. They are the exact replica of the leather jackets worn by the famous celebrities like the one in this super-hit Iron Man.Tony Stark also made the weapons for war, so when he goes to Afghanistan, he introduced a new missile for the terrorists. He finally got to know that the weapons were not in the right hands so he created metal suit and became Iron Man and shut down the Stark Industry when he saw all the violence. Ultimately Iron Man set the record of success for the comic book movies and finally went beyond this summer season. In its wrap up, I would say that Iron Man will make publicity and my outlook is great as a comic book reader.","7/10"
"Iron Man","rparham","5 July 2008","If there is one thing that makes Iron Man a cut above many comic book movies, and on par with such entries as Batman Begins and Superman Returns, it is it's reliance on character and the actions that occur because of decisions that emanate from them, and not the machinations of plot. Iron Man is a story about it's central character, Tony Stark, and he is carried well by performer Robert Downey, Jr.Iron Man opens in Afghanistan, where Stark, millionaire weapons developer, is showing off his latest product for the military. The convoy he is riding in is attacked, and Stark is captured by rebels, who demand he build them a version of his new weapon. Stark instead uses the parts and tools to fashion a suit of armor to help him escape, and keep him alive by preventing some shrapnel lodged in his chest from entering his heart.After Stark manages to escape from his captors, he returns to home, and announces to the world that his company will stop weapons production, which doesn't go over well with his board or directors, or his longtime partner and friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). While the political machinations are going down, Stark is busy tinkering with his armor design to get it perfected, and when he sees the atrocities going on around the world, often using weapons from his company, he decides to use the armor to act.At the plot level, Iron Man is nothing tremendously special. It follows a typical superhero origin story, letting us see how the superhero came into being, the early testing of powers, etc. In that respect, Iron Man is nothing to write home about. However, given that framework, director John Favreau and screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway use it to build the story around the cataclysmic change that sends Tony Stark from being a millionarie playboy who spouts platitudes about how weapons protect the US to a man awakened to the bitter realities that surround him that he had previously shut out.What helps sell Tony Stark is the strong performance of Robert Downey, Jr. Downey, in concert with the script, makes Tony Stark less of your typical superhero and more of an average, if someone eccentric, guy. Yes, Stark is a genius, and has a quirky personality, but he still manages to seem a bit like someone you know and like spending time with. Downey's exceptional dialogue delivery, paired with his devil may care attitude, makes Tony Stark a memorable comic book hero.Iron Man imbues it's secondary characters, even the minor ones, with enough development for us to care about what happens to them, so that when the action sequences occur, we have an rooting interest in the outcome, making them more than just random pyrotechnics. Favreau and company don't accomplish the best action sequences in modern comic book action film-making, but they work well enough to be entertaining.Most of the other performances are up to par, with Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's right hand woman, Pepper Potts, who has a somewhat unrequited interest in Stark. Jeff Bridges portrays Obadiah Stane with both a seemingly well-intentioned interest in Stark's success, but also a just under the surface sense of menace. Terrence Howard fills the role of reliable associate with good aplomb as Rhodey, Stark's longtime military friend.What Iron Man proves, and other filmmakers toiling in the comic book world would do well to take notice of, is that when you bring the focus of your story in on the people at the heart of it, and match them with good actors, the results can be exceptional. We can only hope Iron Man is the continuation of a trend that keeps growing.","9/10"
"Iron Man","Matt_Layden","6 May 2008","Tony Stark is a wealthy weapons manufacturer on a routine trip back from a demonstration of his latest weapon, when he is attacked by rebels who want him to build his latest weapon for their own evil gain. Taking shrapnel to the chest, he must have a pacemaker like device on at all times in order to live. After escaping his captives, Stark sees a new side to life and wants to protect the people who have died from his weapons. Thus creating Iron Man.I've read a few issues of Iron Man, enough to know what the story is about, who the characters are and what to expect from the film. I never went in with high expectations, wanting it to be the best thing since sliced bread, and I left the theatre with a smile on my face. Iron Man is the firs real summer blockbuster movie to grace the screen in a long time. Filled with humorous dialogue, great casting and high flying special effects, Iron Man is one of the best comic book adaptations ever put to film.With the announcement of Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark, I knew John Favreau was the right man for the job. Downey has shined a light on himself so bright that I expect more leading roles to come his way. With perfect comedic timing and a dramatic arc to boot, he has created one of the most compelling comic book characters on film to date. With Peter Parker we are beaten over the head with his love for Mary Jane and his guilt for his uncle, we never really get pass this. X-men has too many characters to keep track of for us to emotionally connect to one central character. Iron Man manages to make a womanizing, alcoholic, weapons manufacturer actually likable. All of that is because of Downey's charisma. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much to do here, but she makes the material work. Howard was a little off his game. His presence wasn't there. It seemed like he wasn't confident enough in this role and it was really out of place. Jeff Bridges is menacing in the looks, but comedic in the dialogue. I don't know if it is my hours upon hours of Lebowski watching, but I just did not find Bridges voice to be menacing at all. I kept hearing the dude. He wasn't threatening enough.Iron Man sets itself apart from other comic book films (except for Batman Begins) with how serious it is. The film prides itself on being more realistic then what one would think. This is accomplished by focusing more on the man inside the armor then the high flying rocket shooting, breaking sound barrier hot rod red ""superhero"". This is because Iron Man is simply that....a man. He has no special powers, no enhanced ability. He has loads and loads of money.The problem with most origin stories is that it has to set everything up. It doesn't have the time to have fun with the story and make it seem really dangerous to the characters. Iron Man has a lot of set up and little delivery on the action. There are two scenes in which Stark throws on the suit and does actual battle. Not including the cave made promo device. This has pros and cons, it does make the film seem more plausible. I believed a lot of what was happening, until the final fight scene. Unfortunately, that final fight scene doesn't knock anyone's socks off. It doesn't blow our minds, it's too generic and the suit, environments and weaponry were not used to their full potential.The special effects are well done, nothing too jaw dropping. It seemed like the crew knew what they had to do and just went for that. Nothing seems to be trying to grab our attention, it all fits naturally. Some scenes are bit off and noticeable CGI is used, which may be distracting to the eye. Specially when Downey is sitting in front of the TV and he has the armor suits arm on his right arm.I'm impressed with Favreau. I wasn't a big fan of Elf and Zathura was garbage. With Iron Man Favreau has found his calling. I hope he doesn't try anymore kid films and sticks to what he knows and does best. He never let the content get away from him, considering it is so huge and upon first glance, would seem out of his league.Iron Man is a fun ride that kicks off the summer blockbuster trend. While it is not as good as X-Men 2 or some other comic book outings, it is indeed one of the strongest ones. With the inevitable sequel, we will get to see what Iron Man can really do.","9/10"

Any worries I had about this film went right out the window, and they'll stay out the window when I go again... and again... and again.

"Iron Man","mediapeertime","17 July 2013","As a kid I loved superhero movies. As an adult, I do too. It's really the story that drives any movie to me. So a superhero movie that is just all special effects and action really does nothing for me. Iron Man, like the original Superman and the Tobey McGuire Spiderman has a great story. Tony Stark, played in avery likable way by Robert Downey, Jr, is somewhat of an egotistical, rich kid with a great mind, but he is endearing, even from the beginning of the movie. You can tell he has aheart, but flaws like any person. After he is captured by villainous terrorists, it's exactly his heart (or damage to it) that allows him to create a mechanical suit that turns him into a superhero. So he's not a superhero, at least in his physicality, like Superman. his great mind and circumstances of his life allow him to turn himself into a superhero.Gwyneth Paltrow is superb in this film, and ""love"" story between her and Downey (Iron Man) is intesne, and so felt, though they never get together (I guess like every real superherp movie, you really are pulling for them to make out). Also, Jeff Bridges was great in the film, as usual. Fine directing by Swingers creator, Jon Favreau.One point: as good as Downey was, I'd rather have seen someone else in the role. Really, a junkie playing a superhero? Sorry, it just doesn't fit right.Ending the movie with Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" was just awesome!","7/10"
"Iron Man","Filmdokter","13 May 2021","#MCUrewatch. It was a brave choice to kick-off the MCU with Iron Man and not First Avenger Captain America. But it was the right choice because it's the performance of Downey Jr. As Tony Stark that makes this such a highly entertaining (and still one of the best) films in the franchise. The actor is helped by a strong script with a straightforward story and brilliant dialogues. Top that off with solid action, great score and a fine performance of Paltrow. The character of baddie Obediah is pretty one dimensional but it's the assure attitude of Bridges (and a great bald head and beard) that elevates this above the average MCU bad guy. The best thing is that in this MCU rewatch you notice already some Stark character elements that are payed off quite a few films into the franchise. He already despises the lack of control over violence (which returns in Civil War) and his ""I am Iron Man"" confession returns later in a rather dramatic way.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Rob_Taylor","23 September 2008","All I can say is, give this one a chance. The movie moves along at a fine rate, there is action aplenty and it doesn't insult your intelligence particularly badly.Robert Downey Jr is excellent in the role of the socially mal-adapted Tony Stark whose world is turned upside down when he gets captured by ""evil terrorists (tm)"". He realises the error of his ways and sets out to change the world.In short, the movie develops Stark's character and lets you see how he becomes who he is. The technology on display is quite far-fetched, but it serves to further the story, not dominate it, or be used as a ""get out of trouble"" card by the hero.Comparing this to the year's other big superhero movie, The Dark Knight, there is really no viable comparison. Iron Man is leagues better in terms of coherent story, pacing and acting. Additionally, the movie leaves you wanting more, unlike TDK which drags on endlessly.In short, if you want a decent action hero movie, you could do far worse than see Iron Man. It's also nice to see the little cameo at the end that hints at future cooperation between the different superhero franchises.Well worth watching.","8/10"
"Iron Man","colorthekid","28 April 2019","Robert Downey Jr. is good in this, but I kind of forgot how good Jeff Bridges' performance was. You can really tell he's an experienced actor. I probably didn't even notice it when I first watched it, not only because I was a kid, but also because I had no idea what good acting looked like, and Disney Channel was my go-to for entertainment, so I don't really blame myself.Re-Watching Iron Man now, after years of watching some pretty great films, made me realize that it's definitely not as great as I thought it was, but still an overall enjoyable fun movie.","8/10"
"Iron Man","JohnDeSando","5 May 2008","Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.): ""Is it better to be feared or respected? And I'd say is it too much to ask for both?"" Iron ManYes, the suit is impressive, a self-contained rocket launcher cum flying machine, but still earthly enough to show some marks from bullets.The opening sequence of Iron Man sets the stage for the film's ironic view of the arms world: Stark rides in a Humvee in Afghanistan only to be wounded by enemy fire generated by his own company. His subsequent incarceration in a cave, culminating in creating the iron outfit not only sets up the rest of his days as super hero but also profoundly changes the way he looks at armament as deterrent.As Stark is played by the mercurial Downey, the sardonic attitude is only a verbal spar away. Downey's checkered life of drugs and irresponsibility helps infuse Stark with the humanity and vulnerability that make him a hero we all can identify with.Superior characterization, effects, enjoyment.","9/10"

The special effects are awesome, especially on Blu-Ray.Iron Man 2 was pretty good, 3 was rubbish (in my opinion.)

"Iron Man","RikerDonegal","1 May 2008","After Superman, I believed that a man could fly. Now I believe that a man can redeem himself, no matter how badly he's fraked up in the past.And I could not be happier that they choose Robert Downey Jr. to carry this message. It works because it's his story, and it shows that he knows this. His heart is in every frame of this movie, his heart is in every word he utters, and your heart will be in the movie, too.It's a cool movie, with lots of things blowing up and stuff like that. But, it's a well-told human story first and foremost. If the X-Men movies strike a chord, it's because each one of us have known the pains of isolation and exclusion. If the Spider-Man movies strike a chord, it's because we all know the little fears and frustrations that drive our daily lives. And Iron Man? Iron Man is aimed at those of us who have made mistakes in the past and want to redeem ourselves.And, it strikes a chord. Believe me, it strikes a chord.

"Iron Man","joshrortiz","2 June 2013","An Iron Man movie? I was worried! How could they make this work? Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark? Jeff ""the dude"" bridges as the villain? I couldn't wait to see how this turned out! When I left the theater, I was so thrilled! A new superhero movie to watch over and over again. Robert Downey, Jr. was perfect casting. So darn witty, funny, charming, smart, cocky, vulnerable, fun, tough. He did a great job in the dramatic moments and brought the laughs in the lighter moments. There is a real change in the character throughout the movie. Gwenyth Paltrow is beautiful and her Pepper Potts is wonderful. The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is fantastic. Terrence Howard does a good job playing Colonel Rhodes. You can tell Rhodes and Stark are best pals. There's a nice little tease here dealing with Rhodes character and an Iron Man suit. Jeff Bridges as the villain? So great! One of my favorite actors for sure! Paul Bettany as the A.I. (good choice) Jarvis? Another genius idea.Jon Favreau did a wonderful job with this movie. He actually managed to pull this off, making The Avengers movie possible. Iron Man is a total blast! Favreau trusts his actors to really give their all, keeps the pace up, and the tone light. He even gets to play a role in the film, nice one Jon! There are so many great moments: watching Tony Stark escape in the Mark I, building his signature suit, saving people's lives, battling Iron Monger, every scene with Tony and Pepper! The special effects in this film are amazing. The final fight between Iron Man and Stane was not on par with the rest of the movie though. Maybe not epic enough, too short? Iron Man flies by. It's a great time! Action packed, funny, great special effects, great performances especially Robert Downey, Jr. And that ending- ""I AM Iron Man."" Woah!","2/10"
"Iron Man","meissotruey","18 November 2019","Good writing, good action, excellent cast, nice epic, probably the most charming villain among the all comic book movies. That's a pity that the actor who plays Rhodey, Terrence Howard, was replaced, he looked much more natural in this role than Don Cheadle, just as always money decides everything. Marvel & RDJ should be ashamed of their decision. Probably the best Marvel Movie, far better than the Avengers, this movie has much more of it's own originality, charm.","10/10"
"Iron Man","Quebec_Dragon","14 August 2009","This is the first actual movie made by Marvel comics's own studio instead of having their characters ""leased"" to another movie studio. They hit this one out of the park. The script is smart but what made Iron Man such a critical and financial success beyond the special effects is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. I just cannot imagine someone who could be more suave, funny and perfect as a genius playboy millionaire tech geek (yes, he beats whatsisname as Bruce Wayne handily). It's like having an Oscar-calibre actor in a popcorn superhero movie. We actually have three with Gwynneth Paltrow and the underrated Jeff Bridges. Tony Stark seems excited about creating and trying his Iron Man armour and it transmits to the audience. I remember thinking when I first saw Iron Man that despite Stark's genius, he could also be a jerk and irresponsible hothead but it's to Robert Downey's Jr and the writer's credits that you like Stark anyway.There's a genuine sense of fun permeating the whole film yet it's not without its serious dramatic moments. Everything would crumble if the superhero armour wasn't up to snuff but the different versions look amazing and believable, with lots of little incidental animation making it more dynamic. Sometimes you might think it's computer generated (and honestly it probably is most of the time) but it's easy to suspend your disbelief especially with the constant but cool close-up shots of Tony Stark inside the helmet with those constantly updating computer readings. That clever trick permits us to see the emotions that are not outwardly visible from the outside. Iron Man doesn't reinvent the superhero movie genre like Watchmen does but it does everything right while adding a few bits of originality such as the initially egotistical selfish almost villainous protagonist who changes as well as the guy becoming super-powered not through accident or mutation but by designing the coolest armours ever seen on screen. Let's not forget that clever never seen before ending who put a big smile on my face and probably most people who watched it in theatres the first time.Rating: 8 out of 10","8/10"
"Iron Man","plopmasterj","5 May 2008","I went to see Iron Man on Saturday afternoon. I truly believe that this is one of the best superhero movies ever! It certainly is an improvement over some of the other comic book movies to come out of Marvel's lineup, like the disappointing Spider-Man 3.Robert Downey Jr. makes one of the greatest performances ever as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is hysterical and is the best part of the whole movie. It's almost non-stop laughter with him, except of course when he is in danger and when he gets into fights with the bad guys. The rest of the cast is also very good. Jeff Bridges is amazing as the villain of the movie Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger. The character is wicked, and Daniels does a great job at playing the role. Terrence Howard is good as Jim Rhodes, while Gwyneth Paltrow proves to be a good love interest for Downey Jr. as Stark's assistant Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts.The special effects are incredible and the action is fun and awesome. Sometimes I couldn't tell when the suit was real or not. The comedy is very good, way better than I expected it to be. I do agree with critics who are saying that the one thing to complain about is the length of the movie: WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE IT LONGER!? Hopefully Jon Favreau will release an extended edition when the theatrical cut comes out on DVD or shortly after that.Great job Jon Favreau! You proved yourself to be a great director when it comes to comic book movies. Do another one! 9/10","7/10"
"Iron Man","Angelus2","2 July 2008","I've grown up watching the 90's Marvel cartoons, my favourite were of course, X-MEN, Spiderman and Ironman. When I first heard of this character being turned into a live action movie I had huge expectations and then saw the trailer. I was captured.The track Ironman by Black Sabbath is perfect, especially the 'I am Ironnnn-Mann!'; at first I thought that this would be like Batman Begins the characters are roughly the same, not the exact same....but both millionaires and create their own suits. The plot is based on the comics, Tony is a weapons manufacturer who is captured in Afganistan (Contemporised); by terrorist who want him to build a weapon and instead he uses this time to create the Mark 1. After escaping Tony has a epiphany and has a change of heart, stopping his company from making weapons; this causes tensions with partner Stane, who plots to bring Tony down by creating a suit known as the Iron Monger, although his name is never mentioned.I never expected Iron-Man to be a comedy and thats what caught me off guard. Comedy suits Iron Man...and so does Robert Downey Jr, Downey is Tony Stark, he gives off a brilliant performance as a fun loving bachelor and brings the hidden depths of the character to light when he realises his wrongs. Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet as Pepper Potts, while Jeff Bridges plays the conniving Stane; Rhodey is played by Terrence Howard who plays the concerning friend and ally of Stark with prominence and I have high hopes of seeing him as War Machine. Its great to see well established actors taking on these roles and making it more interesting and full of depth...The Iron Man suit is spectacular to look at and the second fight scene is satisfactory while the end fight scene with Iron Monger could have been a little better, but this is a origin story and succeeds in telling the origin of Iron Man, the S.H.E.I.L.D touch was perfect at the end.A childhood hero has been given justice...","8/10"
"Iron Man","joebloggscity","4 May 2008","No need to explain who Iron Man is (I hope!), i.e. that guy in the iron suit (surprise surprise) who used to pop up in Spiderman and Marvel cartoons etc when we were all younger. Anyhow away from the comic books, they've now made a film for the character, and takes Robert Downey Junior as Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) to fight the good fight for truth justice and all the rest.Basic story is that its ""Iron Man Begins"" like as was with ""Batman Begins"" and takes us through the origins of the character etc. Mix in explosions, mega robot v robot fight and all the rest, and surprisingly a lot of good humour and you have here a surprisingly good film. I never expected to enjoy this much but this is well worth it. Even Gwenyth Paltrow was well-suited, whilst Jeff Bridges was good as always.A big plus word for the visual effects, which were very good and fitted in well into the movie, and didn't overtake the whole film as it could have, getting the balance right.Recommended viewing. Not as great as Batman Begins, but you'll still enjoy it a lot.","10/10"
"Iron Man","joenasc","20 April 2015","After being captured by terrorists, billionaire Tony Stark creates a high tech suit of armor to escape and return home. Once home, he decides to make another suit, but more improved and uses it to fight terrorists and other evil.As I've said on a previous review, I've never read the DC or Marvel comics; I've only seen some of the movies and shows. When I first saw this, I was unaware that there were going to be more films after this and how they would lead up to ""The Avengers"". Either way, I was impressed.The acting was excellent; I'm pretty sure Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Tony Stark and of course Gwyneth Peltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges were good for their roles. This was, of course, the first appearances of Agent Coulson and Nick Fury and I like them both. I also like Jarvis (Tony's A.I.) I was surprised to hear that some of the dialogue was actually improvised and not scripted; they did well with that. The special effects were fantastic, especially with the suits and explosions. I loved it when Tony is testing his flight suit and he keeps on blasting himself into a wall; pretty funny. Also he crashing through the roof and being sprayed by his fire extinguisher was humorous. He shooting a rocket at a tank and just walks away as it explodes was quite amusing.I enjoyed the action scenes, such as Tony escaping his captors, Tony attacking the Ten Rings in his new suit, and of course the final battle with Obadiah. There were a few parts that I thought were kind of slow. Not boring, just kind of slow. I enjoyed the last scene: ""The truth is..I am Iron Man."" And then everybody goes crazy.""Iron Man"" is probably one of the best superhero movies ever. It was a good way start off the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" and one of my favorite superhero films. I give it an A-.","8/10"
"Iron Man","henryagnew250","7 May 2013","I have seen the Iron man film so many times and I would like to say that I never got sick of the film. What I also liked about this film was that the director had used the original intro just like the comic book series in the 60's. I also like the Iron man mark 1 Armour I just loved it even thought it was only in the film for like 5-10 mins I still think it was just amazing. I also loved the actor that played Tony Stark a.k.a Iron man. He was funny and just perfect for the role of Iron man. I thought the plot was interesting and I thought the villain (Iron Monger) was also interesting and what I was surprised with was that his outfit was Silver and not blue from the comics and in the Iron man 2 figures number 35 you can see the classic Armour of the Iron Monger.Overall I thought this movie was great and I would Highly recommend people to see this film especially for fans of Iron man.","2/10"
"Iron Man","vip_ebriega","2 January 2009","My Take: Robert Downey Jr. is the real treat here. Comic-book movies are growing up! After the success of a revamped BATMAN franchise and the SPIDER-MAN pictures which successfully venture beyond its basic premise, it's about time Marvel's metal-suited action hero to get his share of the spotlight. I'm talking about IRON MAN, of course. And it's quite a surprise. Thankfully, IRON MAN doesn't fall on the tragic path of cheesiness and artificiality like the FANTASTIC FOUR pictures. Instead, IRON MAN is nearly as potent and mature as the SPIDER-MAN pictures, although not as dark or sinister as the new BATMAN pictures.That's fine however, since IRON MAN aims for a different approach. It's a comic book adventure for adults. It's mature and geared more to adults than on the little tykes, yet it still has the feel of a comic book movie. It's got flashy action sequences that are lighter than those in Chris Nolan's new BATMAN movies, including a rock 'em sock 'em battle between Iron Man and a larger metal-suited behemoth. It tackles deeper issues than most superhero/comic-book movies (maybe even deeper than the SPIDER-MAN movies), but it never forgets to be fun, even in the forgettable sense. Robert Downey Jr. makes an eccentric Tony Stark, a weapons industrialist and a genius, not to mention a playboy. Think Bruce Wayne meets Nicolas Cage in LORD OF WAR. Ironically, he's a superhero's own worst enemy. He sells nuclear weapons of the best quality. But after being captured by a underground terrorists asking him to re-build a weapon of his to be used against the Americans, he suits himself up with an artificial ""heart"" and a metal suit armed to the teeth to blow you apart.From eccentric weapons engineer, Stark finishes his advance armored suit and turns himself into a real man-of-steel of the title, much to the dismay of his superior Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, who looks exactly like William Hurt in another Marvel-based movie of the year THE INCREDIBLE HULK), who wants Stark Industries to continue producing the latest in weapons technology. Gwyneth Paltrow also stars as Pepper Potts, Stark's assistant. But the real star is Downey Jr., a superb actor who gives deeper dimension to the typical superhero alter-ego. If the explosions and eye-popping special effects will be gone the moment you step out of the theater, the character of Tony Stark will stay with you like a person you just met. The character is funny, eccentric but most of all, memorable. Director Jon Favreau may not stage the action as good as Christopher Nolan's BATMAN pictures or like Sam Raimi of the SPIDER-MAN films, but he handles the characters real well. IRON MAN is a good start for the summer movie season, but it isn't just a while-you-wait blockbuster for THE DARK KNIGHT (arguably the summer's best picture).Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.","8/10"
"Iron Man","TheRetroCritic","4 November 2023","Directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man was released in 2008, only a month before The Incredible Hulk, and it marked the official beginning of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. After some time away from the limelight, Robert Downey Jr. Was cast as Tony Stark and the rest is history.This was a big, expensive gamble for Marvel and, had it not paid off, it's unlikely that much would have stemmed from it. Luckily, Iron Man was a significant hit that, not only kick-started one of the biggest cinematic franchises ever, but revived Robert Downey Jr.'s career fully, pushing the actor's popularity to stellar levels. While the story in the film is pretty self-contained, it does plant a few major seeds (S. H. I. E. L. D., War Machine) and, of course, Tony Stark would, soon after, cameo in The Incredible Hulk so Marvel were already very determined to build towards an Avengers movie and Iron Man certainly set the standard.The plot of the film sees Tony Stark, the cocky owner of defense contractor Stark Industries, get kidnapped by a terrorist group in Afghanistan where he is forced to face a few uncomfortable truths about his own company while trying to survive. During this ordeal, he loses a friend but develops an arc reactor to keep himself alive and power a state-of-the-art Iron Man suit, as you do.The storytelling here is straight-forward but effective: Jon Favreau balances character development, action sequences and humor in an effortless way, giving the film a refreshingly breezy and light-hearted, yet clever and witty, tone inspiring subsequent Marvel outings, with the exception of the slightly grumpier The Incredible Hulk which had the misfortune to be shot at the same time. Robert Downey Jr. Is simply perfect as Tony Stark. He embodies the nonchalant genius aspect of the character with ease and he balances Stark's inherent flaws with so much charm that you can't help but be on the billionaire playboy's side no matter what.Gwyneth Paltrow is very likable as Stark's assistant/love interest Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges clearly has a ball as the intimidating, and rather amusing, villain Obadiah Stane. Terrence Howard was also well cast as Stark's friend Rhodey but the role was eventually handed to Don Cheadle, who made it his own. This is one of those few superhero movies where everything gels to create not just a worthy comic-book to film adaptation but a genuinely good blockbuster as well.Iron Man was, and it remains, a slick, funny and hugely entertaining action film with tons of charm and personality, some pitch-perfect special effects and a ground-breaking approach to the superhero genre in cinema. This is one of Marvel's all-time best movies and it still very much holds up.Excellent.","9/10"
"Iron Man","haydenluz","24 July 2020","Iron Man, directed by Jon Favreau, is a fun, inventive, and energetic superhero film, that, unlike some of the other MCU films, can stand on it's own. This is arguably one of the best origin stories the MCU has offered up yet, having some memorable scenes throughout. Favreau worked in some great cohesive elements to juice up Tony Stark's back story, to give him some nice depth. It was such a nice relief that this wasn't just a stepping stone, to get a main character introduced, and that be it; Favreau gave us great context to who Stark is, and where he comes from. With Stark's back story set aside, the premise of the film wasn't the most original concept, with some cliché and predictable moments, but it's fine with Kevin Feige adding that Marvel flare throughout the film. The pacing of the film was decent for the most part, until the third act, and thats where the film takes it's major down turn. Everything feels rushed together, while making it feel like just another final act of a Marvel film; there was no real style to it.Robert Downey Jr. was the absolute driving force for this film! Between his arrogant, yet charming performance, to his seamless chemistry with everybody on screen, he just absolutely steals the show, without this being a one man show. I personally related to his character a lot due to the snarky, and slick comments, while also having that genuine work ethic that he poses. The writers gave Stark some good characters archs throughout the narrative, while including great risks and vulnerabilities. RDJ's performance was well recognized and respected, especially after the antics he was personally going through before the casting of the film. His timing to everything was impeccable, with this infectious charisma that simply grows on you before the first act is even finished. RDJ gave a great portrayal to the lowkey comic book character, while making him more well known and likable. Even though Downey Jr. was the star of the show, the supporting characters had a great deal with the success to this as well. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have a whole lot to do in the film, but she puts on a fine performance, being a great compliment to Tony Stark. She is probably the best love intrest between them all, offering something more than being a simple damsel in distress. I just love Terrence Howard, so seeing him casted as Rhodes was really fun for me, while it was also a smart casting, consider Howard plays in these types of roles often. Howard was another great compliment to Tony Stark, playing another character that doesn't really tolerate his antics, and tries to keep him as grounded as possible. Jeff Bridges is our main villain, and he is just whatever. His motive is somewhat there, but the execution was so fast and bland, having no actual critical plan going into everything. He ended up being a pretty dumb villain that was just wasted. On the plus side, Jeff Bridges tried his best, and made the most out of every scene he was in.The screenplay by Art Marcum, Matt Halloway, Mark Fergus, and Hawk Ostby was pretty strong. The narrative felt cohesive, although they couldn't avoid some superhero clichés. The dialogue between everyone carried some weight, with some great jokes along the way. Some of the banter between characters felt improvised, but it worked in almost every application, giving the writting more of a genuine feel.The action wasn't heavily relied on when you think in terms of the MCU, but it was balanced real well with the story, not just throwing random action scenes in, to run the budget up even more. The visual effects were surprisingly not heavily relied on either, but for this being one of Marvel's first films with CG, it was decent.Overall, Iron Man is probably my favorite stand-alone film of the MCU, having great characters, fun writting, and a decent story.","7/10"
"Iron Man","mollymormonbrat","10 May 2008","Here's the deal: I had never heard of Iron Man prior to seeing the trailer. But gosh dern it I thought it looked cool. So I want and saw it. And yes, it was cool.I thought the acting was topnotch, especially Downey Jr.'s snarky performance and Paltrow's demure presence as a his girl Friday character--very good for a classic comic feel.I liked the story. It was fun, to-the-point, and surprising inspirational.I liked the special effects. They weren't over-the-top (I've seen superhero movies with shiner, fancier things) but they were suitable to the story and, if I can say so, fairy realistic and down-to-earth. Nothing splashy, just what was necessary.I like the idea. Iron Man is an awesome superhero.So no, I really can't compare it to anything, but for all intents and purposes I enjoyed it.","8/10"
"Iron Man","Hitchcoc","6 November 2009","I got a kick out of this film. I have never seen one of the comic books nor do I know about the exploits of this figure. It is a nicely done superhero film which traces the origins of the character. Robert Downey is quite good, balancing his innate arrogance against his good intentions. Jeff Bridges is also an excellent adversary. One of the most impressive scenes in the move is the opening in the deserts of Afghanistan as a roadside bomb explodes and Downey and a group of soldiers come under fire. It really gives one a sense of what those people face each day. It may even be a bit real for a fantasy romp like this is. It is down and dirty. There are great events, including the building of the first suit and his effort to exact revenge against the forces that have used his weapons systems to persecute and destroy the civilian population. There is a lot of action and it's not superfluous. Downey's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow and the robots in his lab are a lot of fun. For pure escapism, it's really fun. I assume the sequel is on its way.","10/10"
"Iron Man","KeremUlucay","24 February 2019","After third time to seeing this movie, Im writing that review. Every time I watch it, I find another great things about it. Iron Man is a great origin movie. It has a enjoyable tone and great musics. Also it was an amazing start to a universe which is so much bigger these days. This story is a realistic and fluent piece of science fiction. Tony Stark has a incredible motivation and RDJ is just unbelievable. He becomes iconic with this character. Jeff Bridges is amazing too but Obadiah Stane's motivation is not so so well for me. On the other hand CGI's are great for 2008. Finally, I can easily say that Iron Man is one of the best MCU movies.","9/10"
"Iron Man","Bolesroor","23 October 2008","What did I love about Ironman? Was it Robert Downey, Jr.? Not really... he was good, not great. Was it all the CGI hardware and effect shots? They were fun, but that's not it. I think what I loved was the fact that the movie grabs you from frame one and pulls you instantly, effortlessly, into an aggressive, fat-free narrative with drive... the story moves at light speed, and by the time you realized you haven't touched your popcorn you're in the solid center of a great comic book/superhero movie. The film is also a blueprint for the way all modern movies should be made. Welcome to century 21...See, most superhero movies start with a first act that tastes like medicine. They're dour, solemn setups about nuclear accidents, childhood traumas and secret identities... it's redundant. We are now the sons and daughters of the MTV generation, in an omni-media world, and we know movies like the French know wine. Just put on the damn cape and start fighting crime! This is where Ironman makes even newer hits like ""Spiderman"" and ""Batman Begins"" look like creaky old dinosaurs; the first act is a self-contained mini-movie, as Tony Stark builds the suit not out of an idle need to do good, but to save his own life by escaping from his captors.By the time Tony Stark is back home the movie has brilliantly weaved in all the exposition and back-story we need to enjoy the fun. Directors Steven Spielberg & George Lucas spoke about collaborating on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and they maintained it was impossible to make an action movie without a ""pointer scene,"" a flat, boring, talky sequence which serves only to fill in the back-story and set up the rest of the film. They named this after the scene in ""Raiders"" in which a government official literally puts a pointer to a chalkboard as he lectures Indy about the history of the Ark. Maybe it's a change of the guard, but there is no pointer scene in Ironman. You pick up as you go, and the payoff is a film that rewards you for being smart and paying attention.Director Jon Favreau has to take the credit for the film's greatness. He makes this movie for the audience as he would make a film for himself or his friends; no dumbing-down, no compromised corn or clichéd studio stupidity. He is so committed to this story, so sure that this fantasy is real that he dares you to question it in scenes like the one in which Tony basically asks his secretary to perform open-heart surgery on him. You'll buy it. We're so deep into the brilliant fever dream that it all seems joyfully plausible. Bravo...Ironman should stand as a lesson to ALL filmmakers: stop underestimating your audience. It is the twenty-first century and we've seen everything. Twice. Stop trying to paint by the numbers and just paint. Ironman is a great leap in cinematic storytelling... I hope it's just a beginning.GRADE: A","7/10"
"Iron Man","Vic_max","9 May 2008","This movie combines a good story with some nice special effects. The result is an action-packed movie that is fun to watch. Now, it's not without its flaws - but it's not easy doing ""yet-another"" superhero movie either. Fortunately for audiences, the overall result is strong.Basically, Iron Man is about a billionaire businessman and weapon scientist who has a change of heart after he is injured in a war zone. He develops a new energy source and body armor that give him the ability to fight terrorists - especially those who are using weapons he helped develop. But things turn out to be a little more complicated than they seem ...If you like special effects - this movie has scenes that won't disappoint. The body armor / suit looks pretty cool and the flying sequences are outstanding. (There's an older movie called the ""Rocketeer"" which had similar scenes, but didn't capitalize enough on them enough like this movie).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow all do great acting jobs - especially Jeff Bridges, whose performance is superb. While the editing and some aspects of the plot seem a bit too rushed at times, the overall movie succeeds anyway.It's hard to think about who would 'not' enjoy at least something in this movie - so it's pretty easy to state that this one's worth seeing for just about everyone.","9/10"
"Iron Man","fantasyescapist","6 May 2008","Another year, another superhero film unleashed on the public mid-spring to begin the summer blockbusters hitting the cinema.For starters, I've never read any Marvel comic book, talk less of this particular one on which this film is based, so if you're expecting a review from a comic book fan, look elsewhere. But if you want to read a opinion from an everyday cinema goer, then continue reading.Acting: I felt the leading man was good in his role - he plays the deadpan, womanising and sardonic character well. The sort of hedonistic persona and charming he portrays as a weapons manufacturer works, even if his voice can seem a bit monotonous to me. Jeff Bridges' acting that really stole the show for me. He plays Obadiah, who at first is friendly towards Stark but then becomes horrified and greedy when Tony has a change of heart about his job and turns on him. I could tell he was clearly relishing the role and it's the first time I've seem him act as a 'baddie'. Utterly menacing and powerful. I thought Gwyneth Paltrow's acting as Peppa Potts was decent in places, like the banter between her and Tony but certain shouting from her towards the end during the climax came across as somewhat unbelievable. It doesn't help that the character feels quite cut-and-paste. The chemistry between Potts and Stark didn't ring true for me either - it felt unconvincing to me, and I felt more convinced by Downey Jr.'s acting in those scenes than hers. Terrence Howard was decent too, even if his character wasn't in that many scenes and felt generic.Pacing: Quite rushed to me. This is an introduction or origin story, but once the suit is built, it sort of looses it's way as it hurries to finish the film with a final fight climax. Individual scenes didn't seem to be completed in a satisfying way front my point of view and I felt like I was missing out on a longer scene -they quickly finished and moved on to the next. The action scenes in it were brief and not sustained for full enjoyment and the climax a disappointment, in my opinion. The very topical Afghanistan and the scenes where Stark is tied up and battles there do disturb but relate and update the story to today's world and conflicts which I thought was good.Cinematography: Well, I thought the special effects were terrific - the suit looked amazing on screen and photo-real and the flight scenes, if short, were soaring and fun to see. The robot-armed assistant in the lab was funny and sweet and the technology looked in ways possible, which speaking tech in the suit and lab.Music: Didn't find the score that memorable to me, but the music did heighten the mood in places but maybe another watch will make it more so, who knows? The rock songs did suit the high-flying, tongue-in-cheek and fun atmosphere of the film, though.Overall: An ironic film(in the sense that he's wounded by his own weapons, and his weapons are used against him in a sense etc), that's good and entertaining, if quite a hastened action film that has some snappy and deadpan chuckles here and there, amazing special effects and good acting mostly. Downey Jr. is an interesting, thoughtful and different superhero. Shame the battle at the end climax comes across as generic and it ends too soon, feeling too easily finished, but worth seeing I feel, if you like films of this genre - 6.7/10.","10/10"
"Iron Man","johnnymacbest","29 April 2008","Spider-Man 3 and Ghost Rider SUCKED to the highest extent of the comic-to-movie craze of the millennium. 2007 was a bad year for superhero movies so I came in with low expectations to see Iron Man. The previews looked good but I feared I will be disappointed again and suspect that Marvel has lost its touch after the first two Spider-Man and X-Men films. Well, to be honest I was THOROUGHLY impressed and ENTERTAINED at the same time!!! This film EASILY blows those two crapfests mentioned earlier out of the water completely with an intelligent and well written plot, good acting, action, special effects and most importantly character development, something Sider-Man 3 completely neglected to do. The less said about Ghost Rider the better. But the real star of the show is no doubt the unlikely casting choice of Mr. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His performance really caught me off guard in almost every aspect as a charming, no-nonsense, weapons-making womanizer whose at first glance ""imbeded"" with man's destructive nature but ultimately rises with a heart of gold. Gwyneth Paltow is both sexy and sweet as Stark's secretary who keeps him from slipping further; nice to see a woman whose smart and sexy with real depth in a comic book movie. Jon Favreau's direction is top-notch and knows the material well; moreover, this is the first Marvel film made independently of any major studio. I also like that the Iron Man armor is a combination of CGI and practical effects, helped along by Stan Winston, the king of practical movie effects and his work and attention to detail is very impressive as shown in the past. Though there's lots of humor in Iron Man, it never becomes overbearing and OTT like Spider-Man 3 whose idea of humor is more on the lines of an SNL sketch. My only negatives are some underdeveloped characters and the liberties taken with the Iron Man comics (Tony Stark being captured in Afghanistan rather than Vietnam, not delving into his alcoholism) but those are miner hiccups in an otherwise stellar movie.In conclusion: Iron Man is the best Marvel movie made and I'm eagerly awaiting future installments and after seeing this awesome film I can say wholeheartedly and sincerely that Marvel has truly redeemed itself. See it and be blown away!!!","8/10"
"Iron Man","BA_Harrison","7 October 2012","In 1978, I saw Christopher Reeve as Superman and believed a man could fly (gimme a break... I was only 10); 1989, and The Rocketeer made me want to soar across the heavens (and, being 21, also get off with Jennifer Connelly). Now, at the age of 44, Iron Man Iron Man has re-ignited my dream of tearing through the sky at unimaginable speeds (while blowing the crap out of anyone who gets in my way!).A super-slick, witty, thrill-a-minute, action-packed comic-book adventure laden with top-notch effects and blessed with an excellent cast, Iron Man is easily the best Marvel adaptation that I have seen to date (although, admittedly, I've fallen a long way behind when it comes this particular genre).Jon Favreau's direction is so good, it's hard to believe that the same guy who went on to give us Cowboys & Aliens; Robert Downey Jr. is superb in the role of Tony Stark, the weapons manufacturer who has a change of heart (quite literally) and decides to dedicate his genius to helping mankind by creating a hi-tech suit with which he battle the bad guys; likewise, Jeff Bridges is terrific as his nemesis, evil corporation man Obadiah, who wants to continue dealing in death with the enemy; and Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely lovely as plucky woman in peril Pepper Potts (she's no Jennifer Connelly, though... give me the brunette over the blonde any day of the week!).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.","10/10"
"Iron Man","Bob_Zerunkel","16 May 2012","I couldn't get past the opening. They opened with Stark being a drunk and a whoremonger.In the first battle, a guy screams at him and then he gets ripped apart. The Humvee that Stark is in gets riddled with holes from the projectiles. Stark would have been liverwurst at that point.Then we find out that his heart condition is now merely shrapnel.And that's all I could stand.Why couldn't they make an Ironman movie about Ironman? Why did they have to make one about some god-awful person who was only fit for a Kardashian wedding.They could have had a decent movie that was faithful to Ironman and used the same plot.Extremely poor if you like Ironman. Maybe okay if you favor crap.I won't regret not seeing this turkey, but I do regret the five minutes that I spent seeing how badly they treated a pretty decent character.This movie gets one star for the casting. Robert Downey Junior is a true piece of trash, and his real life fits exactly the despicable person that they turned Tonly Stark into.","9/10"
"Iron Man","captkirk_4","19 December 2008","Spoilers: Now I have to tell you up front, I had never heard of the Ironman character until this movie came out. But the word everywhere was that this was one of the best superhero movies to date so not being a theater goer, I eagerly anticipated it's release on DVD. What I saw was horrible. Yes there were some cool scenes of him flying around in the suit, most of which I had already seen on Ebert & Roper. I'll admit, this concept had potential, but the plot was horrendous.First of all, I for one, am truly sick to death of hearing about Bush's wars in the middle east and setting most of the movie in Afganistan was a horrible idea. I go to such fantasy movies to escape reality, not be reminded of national tragedy. Besides in superhero movies the villains are supposed to be larger than life. This is about as cheesy as the old comics from the 40's showing Superman fighting Tojo, etc. Setting this in Afganistan very much dates this movie and as current events subside, this movie will become unwatchable in a generation. Imagine if Tim Burton's Batman was about not Batman confronting the Joker, but Batman taking on Manuel Norriega, the victim of the regimes propaganda machine at the time. No one would watch it today, fortunately Tim Burton knew better than to give us such trash.Another thing that didn't work for me was the flipping back and forth in time. This is confusing, even in a show I like such as NBC's HEROES. I'm not too fond of this technique and wish it were kept to an absolute minimum. And where it works is where the jump is a foreshadow of the very ending like Lawrence of Arabia, or Fight Club. This movie started out with a random scene from the middle of the movie. The chronological storytelling in Spiderman would have been much better here, especially as Ironman isn't as well known to the public as the Superman, Spiderman, or Batman characters.But the most truly dreadful scene that caused this movie to jump the shark in my opinion was were he invented the Ironman suit as a hostage in a cave. This was so utterly ridiculous, the most sophisticated technology yet created by man in a medieval lockup. The creation of the second suit in the lab I could see, and I wish that point is where this movie began and they rewrote the whole script without the Islamic terrorist crap. On the bright side I did like Robert Downey Jr's work in here and also though Jeff Bridges did a decent job with his new creepy look. But all in all this was a waste of a DVD rental fee and I now have little faith in the taste of all these teenage video game nerds.","9/10"
"Iron Man","DJAkin","5 May 2008","Iron Man was a pretty good movie. It is obvious that Robert Downey Jr has found his true calling. He is a very convincing super hero. I am not a comic book fanatic and don't really know much about the history of Iron Man. However, you don't need to know this to really enjoy the movie. A barely recognizable Jeff Bridges plays a big part in this movie. His head is shaved yet his voice sounds pretty much like ol' Jeff Bridges. There are a few corny scenes in this movie that include Terrence Howard. Yes, there is a scene where he looks at a very shiny Iron Man outfit and says ""another time"". In other words this movie is being set up for a SEQUEL! Movie purists will scoff at the scene when Iron Man FLEW from the United States into Afghanistan beat up a few people and then came back. Purists will question how HE DID THIS? How did he go to the bathroom while flying that distance? Or how about when he was testing out his flight suit and was body slammed against the wall at about 70 MPH? He didn't even get INJURED? Also, that funky looking FAKE HEART that was installed in his chest was not fully explained. All in all, a great movie. Not enough special effects. This isn't like Batman when there is a lot of crime fighting. There were a few scenes when it would have been appropriate for Jack Bauer to show up, especially when that bald terrorist was going to make that one guy CHEW on a RED HOT ROCK. Sheesh, talk about a horrible method of torture!! Two thumbs up!","8/10"
"Iron Man","TomCruiseFan99","25 September 2008","The inspired casting which allowed Robert Downey Jr. to play the title character was a masterstroke of genius. Downey Jr. always dispenses the right amount of wisecracks and barbs in his roles, and when added to a fun action romp, becomes totally enjoyable for the family. It also helps that finally, a superhero movie gets some brilliant actors to elevate the story, and solid support is displayed by Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard.The story is full of typical superhero movie clichés, but there's a freshness and a spark to the story that makes it all seem so original. It still, IMHO, cant surpass The Dark Knight or X-Men 2 but it comes pretty close. And wayyyyy better than the lame Spider-man movies, and the obnoxious Fantastic 4 movies.Tony Stark (Iron Man's alter ego) is at first a military weapons developer, and the filmmakers make it all relevant to modern-day dilemmas, when Stark finds out that his weapons are being used by the very terrorists the U.S Military are supposed to be fighting. This revelation and his capture by terrorists at the beginning, helps to change his outlook on life and thus begins his plan to not just fight crime, but to tackle greed and terrorism (since they seem to go hand-in-hand).The action scenes are crisply shot, and the movie features some of the best special effects of the year. The CGI effects seem so real that it's so easy to accept what you're seeing on the screen. And if you're wondering if there'll be a sequel on the way, the very last line of the movie practically gives you your answer. A fantastic action spectacle, with good actors, great story and brilliant visuals. Don't miss it!","8/10"
"Iron Man","grantss","10 February 2020","I wasn't expecting too much from this movie, thinking that it would be a fairly standard action film. It turned out to be quite entertaining: good action, witty dialogue, the plot was even believable!Robert Downey Jr is superb, but what do you expect from one of the greatest actors of our time? Who would have thought he could star as a comic book action hero, though?!","6/10"
"Iron Man","cobyscomics","26 January 2014","(from http://cobyscomics.blogspot.com/2014/01/iron-man.html) This movie set the stage for such great things to come. Truthfully, I believe if Robert Downey, Jr. had not done the marvel-ous job he did portraying the ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,"" then we would not even be talking about a MCU.Downey's brilliance is in his one-liners, those quips he delivers so perfectly they stick in your head for days afterward. You know what I'm talking about, like when he first dons the original Iron Man armor and absorbs all that AK fire, then turns around and says, ""my turn"".Or, the ultimate one-liner, the one that really sold the movie and made everyone like Black Sabbath again, ""I am Iron Man"".One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Tony gets Pepper's small hands to help him switch out mini-Arc Reactors. When she yanks that copper ring out, I almost fell off the couch laughing.And, yeah, OK, we've got to suspend disbelief for the scene to work, but so what? This is a superhero movie, it's all about suspending disbelief.Speaking of Pepper Potts, this movie did more for female supporting actresses than anything I can remember in a long time. She's more than just a damsel in distress. Not only does she help Tony Stark do everything (including remember his Social Security Number)--which, incidentally, is nearly identical to the relationship I have with my own wife (sans the whole billionaire playboy thing)--but she plays a major role in this movie. She becomes even more important as the Iron Man trilogy goes on, but we see shades of that in this first movie, where she even helps Iron Man defeat the Iron Monger at the end. So, yeah, I say, give Pepper her own movie! I'd watch it.My other favorite scene from Iron Man is when he goes back to Afghanistan to blow up all of the Stark Industries weapons. First off, I'd like to point out how much better the Tony Stark in Afghanistan origin story is than Tony Stark in Vietnam or Tony Stark in the Gulf. The creators of this movie took Stan Lee's original idea of having Iron Man be the anti-communist and updated it to make him the anti-terrorist. Secondly, it's always fun watching the movie and telling people, ""hey, Bagram Air Field, that's where I was for 6 months"" and ""yeah, Konar Province is a real place, and it's really bad"".But, yeah, how badass is it when Iron Man shoots his little missile and then turns around, with the tank blowing up behind him? Hard core.One thing my wife spotted in Iron Man that I completely missed was the Ten Rings flag.This is the same terrorist organization that the ""Mandarin"" would go on to ""lead"" in Iron Man 3. I can't believe I didn't notice this before! By calling this organization the ""Ten Rings"", Marvel was setting up the villain for the third film way back in 2008 when the first one came out. Just another example of why I love the MCU and Marvel's Master Plan.I love how pretty much every movie in the MCU culminates in a Final Battle. Iron Man started this trend, and I love it! In Iron Man we get two giant robots fighting on the streets--how awesome is that! The Iron Monger hits Tony with a motorcycle, smashes him through a bus, and flies him into inner-space, all while taunting him in that great Jeff Bridges Evil TRON Supervillain voice. And it ends with anti-damsel Pepper blowing up the Arc Reactor with a Big Badda Boom that can be seen from space.Finally, we get to the Deleted/Extended Scenes, which I watched for the first time on this viewing of Iron Man. Unlike most movies' deleted scenes, I was actually glad they cut almost all of what they did. If I had seen those Airmen doing their Parade Deck Rifle Drill in the original movie, it probably would've made me hate the thing. The one Deleted Scene they probably should've kept showed Obadiah Stane actually falling into the Arc Reactor before Pepper blew it up. They left him getting blowed up implied in the original movie, which is always dangerous because it leaves things open for one of those comicbook revivals they like to do.Overall, Iron Man was a fantastic movie, one that kicked the whole MCU off. I'd say it, with Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance, is one of the most important superhero movies ever made. Overall, I'd give it a 9 out of 10 stars.Oh yeah, we can't forget the obligatory Stan Lee cameo! In Iron Man, he appears as none other than the original Playboy, Hugh Hefner","7/10"
"Iron Man","accounts_only","29 January 2015","Lot's of action, comedy and really cool effects. Iron Man can keep the whole family entertained with action for the parents, a superhero for the kids and an action packed adventure with a superhero for the adults who still think they're kids. With a refreshingly underused plot Iron Man brings something new to the movie table and Robert Downey Jr's cocky portrayal of Iron Man keeps you laughing throughout. Some may be scrutinising this film if they know the Iron Man story well but I am not familiar with them and find it a 10. These people may rate it a little less but if you love explosions, bust ups and superheroes I don't see how you're experience could go much differently to mine :DFor me the best part about Iron Man is the fact he becomes a superhero almost by accident and the film deals with issues the world faces a lot like terrorism and evil. Potts is your typical love interest of a superhero and may seem a little cheesy at times but Gwyneth Paltrow works so well with RDJ that it slips your mind most of the time anyway. Overall Iron Man is a fantastic film that I will watch over and over again :)","9/10"
"Iron Man","adamsmith-51004","15 April 2021","When it first came out in 2008, I don't think anybody expected it to be as big a hit as it was.It's a great backstory and introduction to the characters surrounding Tony Stark. The plot is fairly simple - but to contain the origin story the movie can't do much more without becoming bloated (see most other Marvel movies). So the Obediah Stane ""Iron Monger"" (really, we aren't going to say anything about that villain name?) plays out as a way for Stark to physically reject the way Stark industries has gone and turn it to a new direction.His change in world view and progression from selfish weapons mogul to tech-hero is fairly smooth.Iron Man is a great character. His is a reflection of the role of industry in conflicts - issues of autonomy, government supervision, and loyalties play at the heart of the character. When his heart is damaged, he changes his loyalties and uses his genius and entrepreneurial power for the betterment of others instead of himself or his company. And this movie does a decent job of showing that.Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Tony Stark and is possibly the best casting in the MCU.","7/10"
"Iron Man","wcmb","12 October 2008","Another special effects film which means if you want good dialog, character development and chemistry walk away now. I thought this one was going to be good and was greatly disappointed. The special effects are fine and predictable and like so many superhero films of late the characters are one-dimensional. The fact that Favreau left the dialog up to the leads instead of investing in a good writer is apparent.Surprisingly Robert Downey Jr. is just okay. His Tony Stark is mildly appealing and his scenes in the lab are probably the best in the film, maybe it's because he is talking to inanimate objects and his computer. He has better chemistry with JARVIS (Paul Bettany) than anyone else in the picture.Gwyneth Paltrow brings nothing to her part. She is again the wooden girl, but there isn't much to the part. Anyone could play it and someone else might have been convincing in her scenes with Robert Downey Jr.Terence Howard seems miscast. For a military man his character is soft and has no military bearing. It's too bad because he's a much better actor than he is allowed to be in this film.Jeff Bridges seems to have a lot of fun with his role. He plays it for fun and it shows. He is the only one who seems to be playing his part for what it is. Everyone else is either taking it too seriously or just can't seem to get past their own parts.If you haven't seen this movie save yourself some cash and rent it. You won't feel like you've wasted any money that way.","8/10"
"Iron Man","DonFishies","3 May 2008","There is really little to say about the plot of Iron Man that most people do not already know about. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is an obnoxiously wealthy CEO of a US weapons manufacturing company who is taken hostage in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. He manages to create an armoured suit he wears to escape his terrorist captors, and returns to the US a changed man.I was a little apprehensive getting hyped up over Iron Man. I was never a huge fan of the character, and with Jon Favreau at the wheel, it did not exactly sound like it was going to be as great as other comic book films like X2: X-Men United, Batman Begins or the Spider-Man sequels (my personal favourite remains Tim Burton's Batman from '89). But rather impressively, the film is much better than I think anyone could have expected.For one, Stark's characterization is a little more rounded than most. Much like Bruce Wayne, he is not really a superhero by the standard definition, but more someone who becomes one. He has the skeletons in the closet, he is a womanizing prick, and he's a border-line (if not full blown) alcoholic. He is not shown as in-depth as Batman was in Batman Begins, but the work put into his evolvement is much better than a typical comic book film.It also helps that Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Stark. I do not think anyone could have pulled him off anywhere near as well. He has just the right amount of cynicism, sarcasm and wit to make the character truly memorable. Any fan of the character, or anyone just looking for an actor putting in the work needed for his character to be believable should look no further. Downey Jr.'s own sketchy past only helps make his portrayal even more credible of someone living the high life, and then re-evaluating themselves and changing to be a better person. It almost speaks as a bit of a metaphor for his own journey, and makes his work here that much more personal. His wounded eyes speak volumes for him and the character.Unfortunately, as far as origin stories usually go, there is not a lot of room for the supporting characters to shine. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's assistant Pepper Potts, but Terrence Howard's Jim Rhodes is very much underused. We know of his importance to the story, but he never truly overcomes the flaw of just being a smarter and more successful tokin' black guy we all know from the years of stereotypes. He sets himself up for future installments, but I think his dialogue could have been fleshed out to be a little more useful than it is here. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane is another underused character, but Bridges manages to chew up a lot of scenery when he is on-screen. I think this may be his most involved and most fun performance since The Big Lebowski.The story itself is another great thing about the film, because it is nowhere near as far-fetched as most origin stories. While the creation of some of the more scientific elements may seem preposterous, its real world basis makes it miraculously relevant to the current war time events going on as we speak. This is a character who could only work after 9/11, and coming out now is probably the best move any studio could have ever made. Stark's story is one for this generation, and I think by not glossing anything over, the filmmakers have done justice to a character who cannot be any timelier. I also like that it focused a lot of attention on the meticulous work he does creating the suit, and showing his little failures along the way. The humour injected into a lot of scenes is also very well done.If anything at all, it could have used a bit of editing here and there however, shaving some time off in Afghanistan and the suit creations (as much as I liked them). Some of the dialogue is a little off as well (especially with Howard's character), and could have been tightened to better effect. I realize that these portrayals are based off comic book characters, but that does mean their dialogue automatically needs to be cheesy, or so silly that it needs to be funny.The special effects are another marvel, making the preposterous science elements seem even more real. Just watching the scene where Stark is trying out his suit's flying capabilities before creating the rest of the suit may be enough to make the film's imaginative structure look authentic. Yes, it does have a few moments where it looks fake and could have used more work, but for the most part, this may be the most fully rendered and realistic looking comic book character to date (in the realm of relying heavily on CGI of course).And as for Favreau, I was very impressed with the way the film handles itself. He truly kept it on the rails, and did not let its ambitiousness become too much for him. Yes, there are flaws, and yes, the film is imperfect. But for someone whose name I doubt could have ever been synonymous with creating action-orientated films before (not counting the family fantasy Zathura), Favreau has truly outdone himself. He has brought a complex character to the big screen, and has created one of the strongest comic book films to date. As I said earlier, I had my apprehensions, but his work here can only lead to bigger and better things.From its startling opening all the way up to its action infused finale, Iron Man is great film in every respect and one hell of a start for the summer movie season. It has its flaws, but the finesse of the story and the lead character make it truly memorable.8.5/10.","10/10"
"Iron Man","lastliberal","6 May 2008","I don't want to hear from those comic book readers on whether or not this is a true representation. This is the movie, and it rock! Robert Downey Jr. was born for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, and I cannot wait to see him later this Summer in The Incredible Hulk, and in Iron Man II, which just has to be made.Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is just the hottest assistant a man can have, and I cannot, for the life of me, understand why he is not... every day.The two of them together is just screen magic and the banter between them is just so charged with sexual energy - it is just amazing.Terrence Howard was great as his Air Force buddy, and Jeff Bridges was perfect as the man you wanted to see die - every more than the terrorists, and you know that is the truth.The special effects were absolutely out of this world.If there is any criticism of all of this movie, it is that it could have been more adult. A little fun with Leslie Bibb, the stews on the plan giving us a real pole dance...Ah, but they have to tone it down to get the bucks from the teens.It still rocks.","8/10"
"Iron Man","evanston_dad","13 May 2008","In much the same way that Ron Perlman's inspired performance made ""Hellboy"" better than it would otherwise have been, Robert Downey, Jr. helps ""Iron Man"" be something beyond the standard superhero junk fests that become popular every year around this time. Downey is perfectly cast, though I never would have thought of him for the character he plays here, tycoon of a weapons manufacturing company who suffers pangs of conscience after seeing what his terrible weapons can do, and turns himself into the ultimate weapon so that he can stop others from using them.Gwyneth Paltrow is Downey's assistant and love interest, and it's a bit of a shame to see such a smart actress stuck with such a dud role as this. She stands around in heels and looks worried while Downey tries to save her.Jeff Bridges, shaved bald and sporting a bushy beard, is the movie's villain, and if the movie has a major failing, it's him. Bridges is fine in the role, but the villain himself isn't particularly menacing, and the final showdown is anticlimactic.Be sure to sit through the end credits for a brief scene that promises a sequel.Grade: A-","9/10"
"Iron Man","Boba_Fett1138","4 October 2008","Basically this movie features all of the right ingredients needed to create a good superhero movie with. It has plenty of big and loud action, comedy, an evil villain, a love interest and of course a superhero in shiny armor. But ""Iron Man"" is actually somewhat more than just another big budget Hollywood action superhero movie. ""Iron Man"" tries it with a more down to Earth approach and tries to place things in perspective, instead of rather just letting things blow up. It's basically perfect entertainment to watch but also with some more layers to it, without ever getting dull or overdone.Perhaps one of the most surprising things about the movie is its cast. Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow all play roles you normally wouldn't expect to see them in. Robert Downey Jr. is definitely back again after his years of drug abuse and life in jail. His life so far perhaps even itself is already good enough to fill one feature length movie with. He isn't the type of actor for the main title role you think about when casting a superhero movie but he perfectly suits his role, with his dry sense of humor and acting skills. He's a tough, cold hearted, womanizer but yet due to Downey Jr.'s performance you care about his character. It's also great that Jeff Bridges plays the bald main villain of the movie. I'll bet he himself never expected ever to play a role such as this in a superhero movie.But no of course ""Iron Man"" isn't a very 'deep' movie and luckily foremost the movie still is an highly entertaining one, that is made very entertaining by Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as well as the movie its action.Iron Man perhaps isn't the best known comic book superhero but he's a real awesome one. He doesn't necessarily has 'superpowers' but simply is a man who happens to own billions of dollars and lots of industrial and weaponry knowhow. With this he knows to create a super-suite, that helps him to fly and has a kinds of other gadget build into it. It practically makes him indestructible to most dangers and enemies but luckily for us not all, or else it of course would had been a very boring superhero movie to watch.The movie features lots of action in it, that perhaps is not the most spectacular you've ever seen but it nevertheless is great looking, which mainly is thanks to its special effects. I seriously can't tell halve of the what's real and what is CGI in this movie. What also really adds to the movie its action is its sound. The movie has some real excellent sound and I sense an Oscar nomination coming up for it, as well as for it's special effects I would expect, perhaps also for the reason that this was special effects legend Stan Winston's last fully completed movie before his death earlier this year. It's not a movie that offers a lot of surprises but it features all of the right required ingredients and has something extra added to it as well. It makes ""Iron Man"" a real effective and entertaining, good looking, well made, modern superhero movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","5/10"
"Iron Man","JoeB131","4 May 2008","This film is awesome on so many levels.First, the performances. Downey completely dominates the role of Tony Stark, a guy who goes from being kind of an arrogant, self-absorbed jerk to a hero. He still manages to keep a sense of humor about him despite all that is happening. Paltrow is his unrequited assistant, Pepper Potts, and Jeff Bridges is the double-dealing Obediah Stane. All of the actors seamlessly meld into their characters.The story is very true to the original comics by Stan Lee, with updates to make it more contemporary. (In Lee's original, Stark has his origin as a prisoner in Vietnam.) Unlike a lot of Marvel Adaptations, they've made the story captivating, even if you are a hard-core comic fan who already knows the tale.The special effects, unlike some of FX sequences, are good but don't dominate the story. The same can be said of the action scenes.W","9/10"
"Iron Man","dee.reid","2 May 2008","""Iron Man,"" a cinematic adaptation of the popular Marvel Comics icon created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Don Heck and Larry Lieber in the early 1960s, is in many ways one of the best comic-to-film adaptations out there (perhaps because Marvel chose to fund this one themselves - the first move of its kind for this sort of movie). Despite having the usual trappings of the usual origin story, ""Iron Man"" is pure fun. What makes this story stand out are two key factors: the smart-a**ed performance of a newly-reformed Robert Downey, Jr., and a smart-a**ed screenplay by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway.Working behind the camera (and sharing an on screen cameo) is director Jon Favreau of ""Swingers"" fame. An admitted Marvel Comics aficionado, Favreau seemed to be the perfect guy to direct an adaptation of Marvel's Man of Steel. Of course, I've never been able to land a copy of an Iron Man comic myself, but I've always admired the character (those who have read my reviews know that Spider-Man is my greatest comic book superhero). As an aside, fans will also realize that Iron Man served as a partial inspiration for the landmark sci-fi picture ""RoboCop"" (1987), and the character is one of the many aliases of Wu-Tang Clan rapper Ghostface Killah, and his 1996 debut solo record was appropriately named ""Ironman.""As billionaire industrialist Tony Stark - who is in some ways analogous to DC Comics' Bruce Wayne/Batman - Robert Downey, Jr. is one of the smartest (and unlikeliest) casting choices for any superhero character thus far. He's got the smart-a** attitude, the irresponsible playboy demeanor, dry humor, vibrant sexuality, and the cool slyness of any man at ease with his wealth. While the comics had a Tony Stark who journeyed to Cold War-era Vietnam, Our Hero is now seen demonstrating his company's weapons technology in war-torn Bush Regime-era Afghanistan.After his U.S. Army convoy is attacked, we next see Stark being held captive by Islamic militants who want him to help build them one of his most lethal and effective ""toys"" from scratch. Stark, who now wears a device that helps keep shrapnel out of his heart (compliments of a fellow benevolent prisoner), thinks otherwise. Using the raw materials at his disposal, he plans to engineer a daring escape plan by constructing a powered suit of armor.After this huge action sequence, Stark returns to California's Stark Industries a changed man. No longer the arrogant rich-boy he was before, he has seen the light; undergoing a sort of philosophical awakening in Afghanistan after seeing the militants use his own weapons against U.S. forces there, he ceases weapons production at Stark Industries, much to the mortification of his business partner and surrogate father figure Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who eventually uses Stark's own technology against him to become the armored super-villain Iron Monger. Along for the ride, of course, is Stark's pretty assistant Pepper Potts (an amazingly well-cast Gwyneth Paltrow), who he starts putting the moves on and she seems to return the affection; there is also loyal best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), who in the comics, of course, eventually becomes War Machine.Yes. ""Iron Man"" is one heck of a fun ride. Yes. It is incredibly well-acted and directed. Robert Downey, Jr., an alcoholic himself and whose drug problems are well-documented in the annals of Hollywood celebrity hell, is perfectly cast as the rich playboy-turned-superhero Tony Stark/Iron Man. Stark's change-of-heart business philosophy and alcoholism battles and many personal demons were well-documented in the comics as well, thus furthering the true-to-life superhero portrayals defined by Marvel back in the '60s when the character first saw print. This is all something that Downey, Jr. plays incredibly well in the film, and it seems he not only looks like Stark, he IS Tony Stark. Also, most superhero movies make the mistake of having the protagonist just jumping into fray; not so with ""Iron Man."" Here, Stark's becoming the iron-clad superhero is a process, with a number of technical glitches that provide plenty of humorous bumps along the way to keep it from ever getting boring.Since the movie is typical superhero origin story stuff, it falls victim to it as well. The film of course ends in a fantastic super-powered showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger that kind of wore itself out after a few minutes in. We've seen so many of this stuff in the origin stories before, so let's just hope that like ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) - the greatest superhero movie ever - ""Iron Man 2/Iron Man Returns"" takes the time to really explore the depth of the character and make good with his many personal flaws.9/10","8/10"

Don't worry, I'll tell you when they begin! ***""Iron Man"" is a combination of great acting and good direction combined with an average script and mediocre film score.The best thing is clearly the choice of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead, along with all of the supporting casting. Lots of great actors and all good performances.Jon Favreau does a good job, here tackling a much larger production than he has in the past. He's said to be an actors' director, and that proves true here. The characters really pop off the screen and that's what makes this superhero movie unique! Of course, Favreau really should have stayed out of the film himself. He has a strange, small role that just makes it seem like he wanted to be in the movie, with no real purpose for doing so.What I didn't like as much was the script. Lots of good elements, but it's weighed down by what I would call Origin-Story Syndrome. By having to tell us all about how Iron Man came to be, the movie kind of becomes a procedural. Lots of explanation, and not as much time for adventure as you'd like.It is weird that there are still problems with this. The first major superhero movie, 1978's ""Superman"" got it right the first time. Why all subsequent superhero movies couldn't take its example is beyond me. ""Superman"" laid out the origin part of its story in the early part of the movie, and got done with it. The rest of the movie was a straight adventure, with the origin stuff all done.But, one movie after another since then didn't get the message. ""X-Men,"" ""Batman Begins,"" ""Fantastic Four,"" etc. all got weighed down by Origin-Story Syndrome. Too much going over how the superhero(es) came to be and not enough straight adventure.The other element that I wasn't excited about was the film score. Not something everyone would be concerned about. But, that standard rock-pop music stuff just has no real energy to it. Good film composers are pretty much non-existent these days, and this movie's no exception! Too bad, because a good film score definitely would have helped make ""Iron Man"" more fun and more exciting.*** SPOILERS START HERE! ***Okay, now to comment on plot points and stuff. I thought it was kind of weird to start with Tony getting hit and abducted in the beginning and then flashback 36 hours or whatever to see his life just before. Immediately, the movie's rhythm is knocked off kilter. Didn't understand that decision.Stark's escape from Afghanistan takes a while to come together. This once again goes into the whole Origin Story problem, where we're taking a lot of time getting to the adventure part of the movie.The following part with the whole corporate espionage stuff almost feels like ""Star Wars: Episode I"" did with all its political stuff. Also, the final confrontation between Iron Man and Iron Monger kind of felt like the ending of ""Fantastic Four"" with a battle confined to a city street at night. Kind of small scale for a big-budget movie like this.The film does have lots of good ideas. The problem is with the pacing and the energy. It just seems like things are kind of casual and Stark at times seems a bit laid back about what's going on. Even in his final line, ""I am Iron Man"" he seems a bit low key. C'mon Tony, say it loud and say it proud! The script and the direction just could use more snap and energy. I got the feeling that the screenwriters and director seem like they are working hard at getting the job done, and not enough time getting into the material and feeling it.*** END OF SPOILERS ***Overall, a good superhero movie. Now that the whole origin story is over, let's get to a straight adventure story and have some real fun with it!******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)","9/10"
"Iron Man","Aaron1375","13 May 2008","I revisited this film for the first time in a while and I have to say, that the Marvel universe really started off on the right foot. Sure, Spider-man had already had three huge blockbusters and the X-men were successful and the Hulk, well he was in a very artsy film; however, as far as films that were interconnected and leading to big things this would be the start. Granted, The Incredible Hulk would stumble a bit, though I enjoyed that one too. This one showed that a lesser known hero could take the center stage as back then he was known to us comic geeks, but not as widely known as heroes such as Spider-man, Superman, Batman or others. Now, nearly everyone knows about him and this is the film that kicked him off and put him on the right track. An origin film that gets quite a bit right as far as how Tony Stark became Iron Man in the comics. Very good action and the effects were good too as the Iron Man armor looks very good. I always enjoy seeing Iron Man in films now because his armor always looks totally cool to me.The story has Tony Stark demonstrating his latest weapon in the middle east. He designs weapons and his company is a major player in the military. Well the convoy he is in gets attacked and he is taken prisoner. He has shrapnel in his chest and it is heading to his hear; however, a doctor has placed a magnet in his chest to keep it out. The terrorist holding him, want him to make a missile, but he decides to do something else. So he designs a arc reactor in his chest and then designs a suit to make his escape in. Once home he decides to stop making weapons and instead focuses on designing a more state of the art suit so he can do some good in the world and be a protector rather than a destroyer. Unfortunately, a man who works at Stark Enterprises and is second in command as plans of his own to build a suit and for more militaristic purposes.The first thing they got right in this one was casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He does a great job and I have enjoyed seeing him portray the role again and again. Terrance Howard was Rhodey in this film and would have continued to be the character, but a salary dispute led him to leaving the role. He is okay, but now that Don Cheadle has been Rhodey in every film since this one it is a bit strange seeing Howard in the role now for me. Jeff Bridges does an okay job as the bad guy, but the suit he wears is a bit more awesome than he is as the main bad guy.The film was good as it started up the Marvel universe of films. Nowadays, the humor and action seen in the films stem from the start which is this film. You get to see the old school Iron Man suit and the more up to date one, though I do wish you got to see the fully operational suit a bit more as the last battle has Iron Man battling at less than full power. Still, the last fight in this one was a bit better than the final fights in the sequels. The film also ends in a bit of a humorous and unexpected way as opposed to what was the standard back in the day with the hero on a rooftop or standing sulkily on a ledge.","7/10"
"Iron Man","PWNYCNY","9 May 2008","Excuse me while I recover from the shock and amazement caused by my extreme surprise that this is an excellent movie. I expected the usual vacuous Hollywood hokum with the usual Hollywoodish heavy handed combination of outlandish special effects masking a superficial story and two-dimensional characters and instead was treated to an actual well-acted, well-crafted science fiction story with actual character development within the framework of an interesting plot. Robert Downey gives a marvelous, surprisingly powerful performance as a hugely wealthy, arrogant arms merchant who undergoes a major personality transformation - for the better. This movie is entertaining from start to finish and is worth watching.This movie is, for Hollywood, a rare combination of special effects extravaganza combined with a substantive story that actually has some dramatic content. This movie dramatizes the problems caused by industrial activity that gains profits through war and how special interests can completely drive and distort a country's foreign policy. That there are some in our society who reap huge profits off the suffering of others is a sad commentary, which is a theme of this movie. The Iron Man is representative of what happens when someone decides to take the high moral road. To survive, the main character has to literally wear a suit of hard metal to fend off the attacks from those whose profiteering schemes are now threatened.","10/10"
"Iron Man","mjplysaght","27 April 2017","Superhero films had become a bit lackluster around the time of this film's release. Of course, some would argue that superhero films are lackluster now, but after films like Spider-Man 3, some people had lost interest.Then Marvel had announced its own Cinematic Universe starting with Iron Man. This film has utterly transformed Robert Downey Jr's career, who at the time was considered a druggie burnout. This film marks his return to form, portraying Tony Stark, a self-proclaimed genius billionaire playboy philanthropist. The remarkable thing about his performance as Tony Stark is that it seems effortless. His confidence and charisma is ever-present as he goes through the film.Tony Stark, the successor to his father's business, Stark Industries has made his name selling innovative weapons. However, when he gets captured by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and learn that they have been using his weapons to terrorise cities, he has a change of heart and manufactures a miniaturized Arc Reactor to keep himself alive after sustaining life threatening injuries and also to power his latest invention, the Iron Man suit.His mentor and father's former partner Obidiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) strongly disapproves of the new direction Stark has made for the company and takes steps to remove him, in every sense of the word.Plot synopsis aside, let's actually review this sucker.The film has several strong points. For one, the character of Tony Stark exudes enough charm that you're always on his side. Sure, he's arrogant and conceited, but what's a character without flaws? Second, the special effects. For CGI that was made for a 2008 film, it still holds up. The MCU would continue to wow us with masterful effects so this was a great starting point. Also, the dialogue feels more natural as the characters are always talking over each other in conversation, as opposed to overly rehearsed and perfectly paced. It makes it seem a little more down to Earth, and yes, I'm aware that I'm making this point about a film in which a man flies around in a weaponized suit of armour.Overall, it's a very well made film and showed to us that superhero films can be really great.","8/10"
"Iron Man","PeterWorthers","7 May 2008","First off, I like Robert Downey Jr. He's a very versatile actor. Any role he is in is brilliant, (Heart and Souls being a favorite) and Iron Man is no exception. He delivers lines almost as if he were making them up as he went along. His playful banter with other characters and various machines and small bits of comedy make the film very enjoyable to watch, and the events surrounding his capture and the first half of the film hit too close to home, adding to the films realism. We get the small nods to the comic geeks (You know who you are, myself included) with a cameo by Stan ""the Man' and even Rhodes making a reference to a War Machine suit that could be in his future. Plus on a personal note, it was good to see the Air Force (of which I am a member) was all over this film, we haven't had this much screen time in a movie since Stargate and the Transformers. Plus we're the good guys again, its nice to see it again, I hate when we're the bad guys; but then again I AM partial. Plus, the Air Force knows when to step in and when to let Iron Man kick a bad guys ass. But I digress. This film is just what we needed to (1.) get the summer movie season off to a good start and (2.) restore our faith in Marvel comic movies. (Need I mention Ghost Rider, Elektra, Hulk,the Punisher, Blade:Trinity, Spiderman 3need I go on?) It is good to see we can go beyond the normal heroes like Batman and Superman to someone who has real depth as Stark does, not because hes a superhero but because he is a screwed up person with many, many flaws. In him we see ourselves, messed up, making constant mistakes but for some reason we want to do good and will try the best we can to make right our wrongs. I can't wait for the next one. Also, stay for a bit more movie after all the end credits are over with.","8/10"
"Iron Man","IQ42","23 November 2021","This was actually much better than I expected! Somehow, I never got around to seeing these Marvel movies (and reading the corresponding comics). Indeed, the first superhero movie I've seen was a Spiderman: Far from Home when I was in the US for an exchange semester.Iron Man was much better!The movie was never boring, had cool fight scenes and an interesting story line about how this suit came to be. At first I wasn't sure what to make of the middle east conflict being involved in this movie but I think it was actually incorporated pretty well and a reminder to the existence of terrorist groups and actual war in that part of the country, as well as the possible abuse of weapons.I think I'm becoming a superhero fan!","7/10"
"Iron Man","eamon-hennedy","19 July 2009","Yes, I know, the title to this review is a quote from Richard Donner's Superman The Movie, but there's a reason for that, and I am going to get to it, so bare with me.In a summer dominated by the darkness of, well, The Dark Knight, it may be hard to remember than a month of or two before it we were all basking in the universe of another comic book character, a multi millionaire, too, and, what a coincidence, a character who uses his quite considerable wealth to turn himself into a superhero. All similarities end there (don't worry comic book fans, this is not a review of compare and contrast proportions). For as The Dark Knight falls into a darker and darker pit of despair, terrorism metaphors and increasingly dark plot twists and even darker cliffhanger ending, Jon Favreau instead creates a world of blue skies, brightly coloured costumes (well, for the hero anyway), witty dialogue and, above all else, a lovely atmosphere of fun. Iron Man is, pure and simple, unadulterated fun, amazing when you consider that a good half hour of the film takes place in war torn Afghanistan, with the lead character in the hands of characters who are essentially terrorists. Of course, if the film was in other hands, this would lead to many a darker moment, probably using the comic book genre and lead character as a means to explore modern day warfare in the war on terror. Not Favreau. God bless Jon Favreau because what he chooses instead to do is have fun, lots of it.I have a confession to make. I didn't get to see this film until recently. At the time of writing I only watched the movie on DVD for the first time the night before. Another thing, I loved The Dark Knight. I levelled some mild criticism at its darkness, but loved the movie nevertheless, but here, we get something that is positively giddy, funny and very, very enjoyable. I can't believe I missed it on the big screen, because this is great, and as a sci-fi adventure/comic book adaptation, it's got everything that I love to see in a Hollywood blockbuster of this nature. Imaginative action, funny dialogue, humour whilst retaining an ability to keep the film serious so it can remain engaging and great acting. The latter is particularly impressive. I know it has been said by many elsewhere, but let it be said again, primarily because I want to say it, Robert Downey Jr is fantastic. If played right this should be a comeback of John Travolta/Pulp Fiction proportions. He was always an actor that I liked (please check out Hearts and Souls if you have a chance) and here he brings that cheeky, comedic quality he always has, but filters it through a wonderfully engaging heroic complex. Quite simply he plays Tony Stark in such a way that you want him to be a hero, you want him to make the right choices and by God you want him to save the day. There are no Christian Bale style brooding moments here. Tony Stark is a lot like the movie itself, it's a hell of a lot of fun.I still haven't mentioned Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges or Terrence Howard, but they all put in good work too, particularly Gwyneth, the will they/won't they chemistry between her and Robert is lovely and played almost in a 1940's screwball comedy way. Did I mention she is gorgeous throughout, not that it's important. She is though.And the final scene is brilliant. I want another one and I want it now.","9/10"
"Iron Man","Craig_McPherson","5 May 2008","I have to admit that Iron Man wasn't on my preferred reading list as a kid when comics made up a large part of my reading material. Superman, Batman, and the more obscure Tomahawk were my staples. So taking in John Favreau's rendition of Marvel's Iron Man allowed me the luxury of not bringing excess baggage to the screening. The result? Iron Man is a treat for the senses.Telling the story of billionaire military industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who during capture by Taliban-esquire guerrillas, develops both his tin man design and a clarity of vision causing him to see the evil of his company's ways, Iron Man unfolds with a style and flow that most movies can only envy.During filming Favreau allowed his principals free reign to improvise their own dialog. The result, along with some smart plot scripting by a quad of writers, is a film that has a natural, unscripted feel that lends it a natural, somewhat realistic feel.Rounded out by an impressive cast that includes Terrence Howard as Stark's military confidant Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as his long-suffering love interest, and Jeff Bridges (The Dude) as the movie's villain, Iron Man plays out very much in line with creator Stan Lee's original vision of Tony Stark patterned after genius billionaire playboy Howard Hughes. His vices of alcohol and women are there, but in muted form.Designed as the first installment of a trilogy, with all actors signed for the duration, the continuation is expected to further delve into Stark's alcoholism as well as the advent of Rhodes' morphing into War Machine, which is hinted at late in the film.Originally optioned by Universal with horror icon Stuart Gordon (Edmond) to direct, Iron Man bounced around studios and production houses ranging from 20th Century Fox through Paramount, with, at varying points, everyone from Quentin Tarantino and Joss Whedon, Smallville's Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, to Nicholas Cage and Tom Cruise having being penciled in for the production, the final culmination under Favreau and Downey is a movie that will enthrall viewers from the first frame to the last. So grab that bucket of popcorn and large drink, and sit back and enjoy.","9/10"
"Iron Man","popyoshi-36312","25 February 2023","A great origin story about an egotistical weapons dealer learning the effect of his actions and trying to change for the better, the story is really well told and very sweet but it is still relatively basic and is a simple origin story, the movies villain is also very boring and uninteresting with no real reason for being evil, that being said it is still a fun and enjoyable movie that is definitely one of mcus best and a great film to just watch with or without the mcus instalments. I recommend the film for anyone whose not seen a super hero movie before as it's a great introduction to the genre, and it's a great super hero film for people who are overly familiar with the genre.","6/10"
"Iron Man","Red_Flag","25 May 2008","There's no doubt Iron Man is an entertainment machine and a stunning one at that but it's a damn shame it takes so long and at so much expense to get there. Sure the pacing's not great and both the beginning and the end flitter with dodgy CGI and a underwhelming feel but there's no denying that the central parts of Iron man is the very best of marvel. It's lead man Robert Downey Jr. Who shines the most. He has just the right amount of dry Witt and charm to carry the film through even its patchiest moments.From Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures comes Iron Man, an action-packed take on the tale of wealthy philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who develops an invulnerable robotic suit to fight the throes of evil. In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, one of Stark's colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in Whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. Jon Favreau directs, with Marvel movie veterans Avi Arad and Kevin Feige producing. Paltrow provides some much needed flavour to the otherwise dry script and Terrance Howard adds to the humanity that is often forgotten in super-hero movies. Fortunately while Iron Man does deliver on the humanity level when needed it doesn't allow humanity and realism to bring down the overall fun of the film as it is in Spider-Man 3.Iron Man isn't perfect, it's riddled with ultimately forgivable flaws but flaws none the less. Flaws witch most of the world seems to be able to over look considering its high rating and a place on IMDb's Top #250. For some though the flaws are too huge to simply ignore. Most eyes remain of Downey Jr. Throughout the whole show and quite rightly so. He is charming, sophisticated and best of all very funny. Its clear he was the right choice for this role. The CGI is a tad strange, flitting from computer graphics reminiscent of the original spider-man all the way to last year's transformers, there often bad there mostly good.Not too light, not too dark a bit grey, then? Not at all: this is buoyant, bright, a constant breeze. But still it hovers somewhere on the superhero-adapt spectrum between the good and the great. Not as flyweight as Fantastic Four or Daredevil or Ghost Rider, but just missing the myth-spinning splendor and heft of a Spidey 2 or X2 or Batman Begins.","8/10"
"Iron Man","dfle3","30 May 2008","This is the brazilianth superhero movie to come out the US in the last picosecond. And it's not too bad, but, like with most of them, I doubt I will be as willing to see any subsequent sequels.In its favour is the performance of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man. The movie is basically boot-camp for people unfamiliar with the titular hero. In other words, you get the genesis of the character ""Iron Man"". Stark, as played by Bob Downey is smug, but fortunately comes with a dry sense of humour. Stark is a brazilianaire who inherited his fortune from his military industrialist father. Utilising his own scientific brilliance, Tony Stark has carried on in his father's footsteps and is now the supplier of choice for the US military.His Personal Assistant is Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Quirky name, but not in the same league as Pussy Galore, or Alotta Fagina. Paltrow provides her character with a degree of warmth...and coolth. She is reminiscent of some of Woody Allen's leading ladies at times, too, like Mia Farrow or Diane Keaton.Anyway, the story is basically about how Tony has a crisis of conscience after he gets a taste of his own medicine, arms wise, in the Middle East. Generic Middle Eastern terrorists are one of the main bad guys in this film.In a way this is an American fantasy about itself. In Hollywood movies like this, America plays the hero in the Middle East and Americans care a lot about not inflicting civilian casualties. This is ably demonstrated by Iron Man in one scene where the phrase ""surgical strike"" is not pure spin.A theme of this movie is the struggle between the individual conscience and that of society or bodies like the military/Pentagon. Stark has a foot in both camps and thus sometimes mud will stick where you least expect it to.As I was just about to leave the theatre, after the end credits, an extra scene appeared, hinting at the nature of the sequel. Dunno if I'll see it.7/10","7/10"
"Iron Man","alexglimbergwindh","12 March 2022","This movie has what all movies should be.In the early marvel movies you had great visuals, good story, character development and real humor that fits in.None of that forced bs plaguing the newer ones.Love the soundtrack for Iron man as well.","10/10"
"Iron Man","KineticSeoul","3 December 2011","This isn't a awesome spectacular superhero movie, but it's still well crafted and entertaining. Iron Man is a Marvel superhero that stood out to me and in this, it gave me more interest in Iron Man and even Tony Stark the man behind the suit. Robert Downey Jr. really carried the movie in this as Tony Stark, the way he acted felt close to the comic book. Not exactly like the modern comics that has Iron Man in it but close enough. This is a origin of how Iron Man came to be and the build up of it all is nicely done. The build up is a long process but I wasn't necessarily bored by just watching how Tony Stark becomes the Iron Man. Jeff Bridges did a great job playing Obadiah Stane, he didn't have a lot to work with here. But when he was on the scene his presence was ominous and fit right in while also being intriguing to watch. I watched the movie ""Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room"" and he reminded me of the greedy and power hungry higher ups in a company. It's a shame his character wasn't developed all that well, but again this movie is about Tony Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow also did a good job of playing Pepper Potts, she did the perky and cute assistant thing well. The main flaw about this movie is that it just doesn't have enough Iron Man in it. I know the build up had to be a long process to show how it all happened in a short amount of time as possible but it would have been nice if it had like 2 or at least 1 more scene with Iron Man in action. Overall though this is a well crafted superhero movie that is a good blend of realistic and sci-fi that fits right into a comic book universe. It's a shame the next sequel won't be as good. But looking forward to ""The Avengers"" movie which is hinted at the end of the credits. This movie ended in a very good note as well and will leave the audiences excited.7.9/10","9/10"
"Iron Man","FlorisV","19 February 2017","One of the best superhero films, if not the best. After a second watch, I realized how good it was and how much better than so many others.Good and quirky dialog, never a dull moment, well dosed action scenes with enough suspense and sense of danger. Great fun. The characters' motivations are always clear and believability never went below the expected minimum. Action scenes are very well filmed, efficient and never with the usual cheap fast cuts. The villain simply works because it's someone seemingly much more powerful, plus a treacherous man you just love to hate. And our protagonist has much-needed weaknesses: he's only human, and a bomb shrapnel close to his heart.The film looks and sounds great overall. Every character, including Jarvis, adds value and has an important function for the story and the entire casting is just sublime, with Downey's star shining the brightest. He even manages to make you care about a selfish billionaire playboy before he transcends himself.I can't put this film down. It still serves as a benchmark for all other Marvel productions that have come out since and none have achieved it's level, though some have come very close (Winter Soldier). But I guess there's truly nothing like a good origins story! After 8 years, this film is still as awesome as ever.","9/10"
"Iron Man","erinandvictor","1 May 2008","This was a great movie. I am a huge Downey fan, but was really unsure about him playing a super hero especially a guy in his 40's. I can say that because I'm right there with him. He was amazing. I normally don't like these kinds of movies and wouldn't have gone to it if I hadn't known someone who was an extra, but I am so glad I did. Jeff Bridges was so good, I'm having a hard time with him being bald, but it was a good move. My only complaint, was Gwyenth Paltrow. She was horrible, it was like she was really trying to play the part, she half-you know. But other than that it was great. Special effects, whoa.Good job.","10/10"
"Iron Man","jaddison383","9 May 2008","All to often, superheros turn into geeky, rather dull characters when they get out from behind their various costumes. 'Iron Man', on the other hand, in a stroke of brilliance, makes it possible to love the man behind the metal mask even more than the hero itself. For the first time, we're not dealing with a dual personality here- Iron Man and Tony Stark (his true identity) are one fully realized character.Mr. Stark is the rich young owner of a huge weapons dealing company. While displaying his newest creation for the army, he is captured by terrorists who order him to build them a bomb of their own. It is in this place that he has a revelation and escapes with one purpose in mind: He must retrieve the weapons that he himself distributed.Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on perfect in the lead role. He somehow blends sarcasm and real caring into nearly every line. The result is someone we can laugh with, yet also genuinely care for. As Pepper Potts, Tony's longtime secretary/caretaker/love interest, Gwyneth Paltrow delivers the goods once again, playing both hard-to-get intelligent and still very girly. The relationship between the two leads plays wonderfully, never going into schmaltz or typical lovey-dovey-ness. Instead, their interest in each other is not hardly addressed up front, yet through great performances is made clear. Jeff Bridges adds his own flavor as Tony's business partner.Director Jon Favreau keeps the pace quick and the editing sharp, bringing the excitement to near boiling point at times. Yet he also shows an intelligent and graceful hand with the more plot-centered scenes, in particular the ones between Tony and Pepper. All in all, a fun and exciting way to start off the summer. Check this one out on the big screen while you can! Jay Addison","8/10"
"Iron Man","Robert_duder","21 May 2008","I definitely had my doubts about Iron Man. First of all I am not a big Marvel fan, always been a DC kid, and Marvel has been churning out stinkers including the less than stellar Spiderman 3, Daredevil, Hulk, Fantastic 4 and so forth. I had very, very low expectations for the film and then the reviews started coming in from professional critics and...they loved it? They raved about it and then people started talking about how great it was and I knew I had to see it and find out for myself. First of all I can say that Iron Man is absolutely captivating. Nothing I feared for the film pans out...I thought special effects would be over blown and cheesy and they weren't even close!! I thought the story would be too fantastical to translate to screen and they did it perfectly. I had no background on Iron Man, never read a comic but it seemed to me to be the last hero you'd want to try to make into a serious live action film but it seems to me that the film makers took very careful steps in bringing the character to life and hired a cast that was quite simply brilliant in every way. A really great ensemble, a well thought out story, good but not overblown special effects, and really kept true to their fans already existing.Robert Downey Jr. is being heralded for his performance as Billionaire arms dealer Tony Stark. He is excellent. He has a flare certainly for the sarcastic biting comedic wit. However that alone would have made him nothing more than a George Clooney as Batman fiasco but to my surprise he also made a terrific hero and leading man and really lights up the screen with his personality and performance. Terrence Howard who is a really terrific actor gets a supporting role without a lot of depth but given Howard's ability he makes a great pseudo sidekick to Downey Jr. performance. I think his character could have been given more but he does excellent. Jeff Bridges is just an amazing super villain. His story starts out on the low end and really turns him into the ultimate villain by the end with a very cool robotic fight at the end. He is just an excellent adversary and also extremely talented. Gwyneth Paltrow returns to the big budget screen as a sidekick to Tony Stark and somewhat of a love interest as Pepper Potts. Her role is toned down as well so as to not overshadow the main character but she is good opposite Downey Jr. and their chemistry is excellent. Throw in the obligatory appearance by co-creator and Marvel god Stan Lee (who I immediately recognized the first time) and a very small cameo role by director Jon Favreau and you've got an incredible cast together with a great story.As with all Superhero films we have to get the creation of the character and the unique thing about Iron Man is that the entire film nearly is Stark creating and perfecting this persona and then exacting revenge and saving the world from his own weapons. The story definitely leaves everything wide open to serialize (they've already announced a sequel) but can they possibly re-create the same great team and story that they did for this one. To me, who had very low expectations, I have to feel like this was a big successful fluke that all these pieces fell into place but maybe I'm being pessimistic. Regardless Iron Man starts off the summer blockbusters with a huge bang and you won't be disappointed in the story, the action, the characters, the actors or anything else about it. I just found myself completely enthralled by the story as fantastical as it seems, somehow they found a way to make it real and bring it to life without it looking stupid and I thought that would be their real challenge but I was wrong. Iron Man is absolutely astounding!!! 9/10","9/10"
"Iron Man","EijnarAmadeus","7 May 2008","IRON MAN is the latest superhero-movie in cinemas, and it's another round of man-turned-into-amazing-powerhouse with CGI, love interests, a full on CV-cover-up and mayhem. And this is the first Marvel-child that's fully financed by Marvel Studios, and being a blockbuster it's surprising how they've chosen such a bold casting and choice of director; surely, casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man is interesting even before you've seen the teaser, Gwyneth Paltrow as the smart and sexy assistant Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges villain Obadiah - and director Jon Favreau seemingly came out of nowhere.The film opens up with twinkling ice-cubes in whiskey, and soon the high-flying main character Tony Stark gets blown up by his own weapons as he gets locked-up for three months by Afghanan guerrillas to build a missile, instead he and his temporary sidekick makes Stark RoboCop 2: the Rusty & Deserted Sequel, as Stark shoots his way out of danger and returns to his glossy everyday - but now, as a changed man. The near-death experience kick-starts his goal for becoming Iron Man - but as soon as Stark adds the hot-red colors to his suit, the movie loses momentum; this is where Iron Man actually starts, so we're expecting something spectacular, but instead we get messy. Director Favreau is funky, and he knows how to squeeze every little drop of cool and swagger from Downey Jr., but as the action-bits starts coming, they're too brief and feels like a lackluster. IRON MAN's surely got potential, and the soul of the movie is surely in here, but a sequel that's right-on explosive is surely the right way to go from here.","10/10"
"Iron Man","angelynx-2","4 May 2008","For many months I had no hopes for, or interest in, this movie whatever, expecting just another explosion-loaded summer gadget-fest for the tech fanboys. When I heard the buzz on Downey's performance I decided to see it, but I still had no expectations in particular. Well, I got a surprise and then some, because this is one heck of a smart, funny, rockin' movie. It has huge kinetic energy, and stays on course throughout, never sinking into the trap of a long, dumb, drawn-out special-effects brawl (I'm looking at you, X-Men III); the Iron Man suit is a ***real suit*** from the wonderworks of Stan Winston, not CGI, thank heaven!; music choices are very cool (Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" and Suicidal Tendencies' ""Institutionalized"", yeah!); casting and acting are excellent (Gwyneth Paltrow gets high marks); and Downey's performance is simply a marvel--pun only half intended!--perfect from start to finish. From his fast-talking hyperactive demeanor and the edgy, nervous intelligence of his eyes to his expressive face and understated body language, he really IS Tony Stark, completely believable as a high-tech genius used to living on his mind and nerves (and alcohol) alone. (I'm guessing the buff physique is just something he cultivates to make sure he looks good in those expensive suits.) Playing Stark as a wired 21st century media star instead of the outdated stereotype of the suave high-living playboy is a brilliant stroke, and his crisis of conscience is completely convincing without being at all maudlin or overdone. --Downey's just great in this, and I publicly apologize for not having had any confidence in him, cos this could not have been played better.To top it off, it's even got a relevant and topical anti-military message, raises touchy subjects like American foreign policy and war profiteering, and has a surprise cameo after the credits (do not leave early!) that raises all sorts of speculations for the future. =)---Man, I had the best time at this movie. It's a complete kick, and much, MUCH better than I expected.","10/10"
"Iron Man","diac228","8 May 2008","To kick-start the 2008 blockbuster season is an enjoyable entertaining first look at Marvel's answer to DC's Batman. After years of begging, one of Marvel's more popular comic books appears on the big screen equipped with a stellar cast, massive budget, and drastic marketing campaign displaying how much more fun it is to follow the man in the metallic suit rather than the man in leather. Iron Man is a film that contains enough attitude and energy to intimidate other films of the same genre. Much like Batman Begins, Iron Man slowly but surely explains the origins of our hero and displays how and why he becomes the superhero that we all know. The only difference is Iron Man is simply a lot more fun and enjoyable to watch.The hero in this tale starts off a womanizing, sarcastic, selfish and carefree leader in a weapons manufacturing business. Tony Stark was trying to sell his latest greatest inventions overseas when suddenly he is kidnapped and is forced to manufacture weapons for the enemy. Right then and there he realizes that he's accidentally producing for the enemies as well as for the allies. Upon this revelation and being caught up in the middle of it, he crafts his greatest invention: which is a killing, nearly invincible machine full of ammunition and tricks. With a few major adjustments, this ultimate weapon becomes his new alter-ego, which is the heroic yet fearful Iron Man.Iron Man's biggest strength lies in the realism. Guess what, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is not a flawless hero, he has his moments of questionable decisions, lack of morals, and inability to see some of the dangers he creates. His secretary (Gwyneth Paltrow) is not a mere toy for our hero, nor does she settle for Stark and all his flaws. The lack of attempt to make the superhero seem perfect is definitely a breath of fresh air when compared to recent comic book movies. To add to that, Iron Man is not a mindless action movie full of explosions and carnage; most of the movie focuses on Tony Stark and his transformation from carefree millionaire to protector of the general public. Using a great script from Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, the movie is sprinkled with great one-liners, good dialogue, and very little slow-down and unimportant moments.Robert Downey Jr. does an absolutely stellar job as Tony Stark, and fits the role perfectly. Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Terence Howard do pretty well with the material they were presented, with the exception of one scene that wasn't supposed to be funny (Bridges can't yell). Complimenting the acting is the special effects, which never overpowers the actors nor does it overpower the scene. When Iron Man is fighting, the only thing you can do is sit back and enjoy the wild ride. The special effects weren't the greatest, but they certainly got the job done. Unfortulately, the final fight wasn't that great because we witnessed robotic carnage to the nth degree last year in Transformers. Topping Spielberg and Michael Bay is never easy in terms of action pieces.What keeps Iron Man from becoming a comic book movie with the top-notch quality of the best comic book movies (My personal favorite is Spider-Man 2) is the fact that the main character and alter ego need time for presentation and introduction to the audience. The potential in the Iron Man franchise is not only immense, but it basically spills into the screen at all times, especially in the final moment after the credits. Iron Man is the beginning of something potentially very special. Spider-Man 2 had the advantage of us knowing the man behind the suit, and got the pass to deliver two hours of intense, emotional, and excellent film-making. Iron Man 2 can be the next Spider-Man 2, as long as the same amount of dedication and effort is put into the project.Bottom Line: In the meantime, we have one heck of a flick here, as Iron Man dwells beyond the typical comic book flick and delivers a great start to the 2008 summer movie season. Great acting, excellent special effects, and more promise for the future of Iron Man should be enough reason for you to see this. Even if you don't know a lot about the comic book, the movie does a great job in presenting the man behind the iron mask in all his glory (and anti-hero glory). Recommend, as the beginning of a great franchise is offered here.P.S. Except a killer soundtrack here too.","4/10"
"Iron Man","dantheman0056","23 June 2008","Iron Man is truly one of the best comic book films out there. Robert Downy Jr. was a questionable choice to many to cast as Tony Stark. Rob has proved them wrong as RDJ's performance is the best part of this film. Tony Stark a cocky, full of himself, multimillionaire has made billions on selling weapons. But when a trip to the middle east goes wrong, Tony finds out just how "" good"" his weapons are doing to the world. Tony builds a suit of armor to escape capture and when he gets home vows to change himself and the company. What ensues is a vicious power struggle against Obidiah Stane ( Jeff bridges) and the creation of Iron Man. The special effects are very well done and believable. One complaint is that there isn't very much action, but there are several well done scenes. The supporting cast is very good especially Gwenyth Paltrow. The dialog is smart and funny. The reference to SHIELD and Samuel Jackson after the credits are very exciting. Although my favorite comic book movie still goes to Batman Begins, iron Man is a very good film.","10/10"
"Iron Man","azeemnavarro","26 August 2019","In a personal quest of giving the MCU a second chance to prove me that is not as awful as I think it is, I will rewatch every movie up to Endgame, so we have to start with Iron Man. And yeah this is exactly what I remembered it was: a fun superhero movie that actually knows what to do.
With Iron Man, Marvel found a formula that worked, and that unfortunately they have squeeze for 10 years that every ""origin"" movie they make is just a remake of Iron Man. And I get why they do this. Iron Man works because it plays safe. We get a simple history, the typical hero's journey, ad what better if the hero we're talking about is Iron Man. Who knew who Iron Man was back in 2008? Just comic book readers like me, if you asked people if they knew Iron Man, they would've probably ask if you we're talking about the Black Sabbath song. Robert Downey Jr., a faded star that had some very serious addiction problems (ironically, just like the character itself), was gifted to play Iron Man. The man was born to play Tony Stark, yeah he's a great actor, but if you think about him, this role will pop in your mind instantly. He does a wondeful job at playing the childish CEO that eventually transforms in the hero.
But enough praise for Downey Jr., there are other things to talk about. The rest of the casting does a great job, except for one color dude no one remembers. An unrecognizable Jeff Bridges is the villain, and while the character itself is weak and we don't get so much explanation at why he's bad, Bridges still does a good job. Gwyneth Paltrow was also perfect casted as Pepper, she is in every Iron Man film a great support character, and her relationship with Tony Stark here is charming.
Why everyone went to the cinema when this was released was part thankful to that red and yellow suit. I have to say that the CGI of this film back in the day was impresive, but it hasn't aged that well, especially at the fight at the end with the villain. Still, is not annoying or anything like that, but is quite distracting.
So yeah, I have to say that Iron Man, while flawed, was a perfect start for the MCU, that after this one, has released more than 20 movies, few of them reach the quality of this first instalment, but all that succes is thanks to a playboy we all love.","8/10"
"Iron Man","shiftyeyeddog","4 May 2008","Iron Man. Who'd have thought?Quite simply one of the best superhero flicks ever made, and a strong contender for the top spot. I honestly don't know if I can pinpoint a single flaw in the film, except that I wish it was even LONGER. Not only does it succeed as a comic book adaptation, it succeeds as just a great MOVIE. Probably the most fun flick I've seen in a good two years or more.So how did this movie get it right when so many others get it all wrong? It certainly isn't just the character. Iron Man is a second-tier Marvel character that never really caught my eye much or gained the general public's love. I believe it was two factors: casting and respect for the material.First and foremost, I can't imagine anyone but Robert Downey Jr. playing this role. He owns it so completely and is such a perfect fit that I have to wonder how much of the script was completely re-written for him or was improvised. His brand of humor and wit, along with his great range as an actor allow him to convey the whole arc of Tony Stark's story, and to make it entertaining every step of the way. I am especially impressed at the studio's decision to *gasp* actually cast an appropriate actor over 40 years old, rather than cast young just to bring in the teen box office.While so many other comic book flicks treat their material (and audiences) condescendingly, or just as a silly story that can be used to show off cool effects or action scenes, Iron Man instead respects that it can be just as good or respectable as any other film. Nothing is over-the-top or forced. The story is much more grounded in reality than most superhero genre films - There are no ""superpowers"", just technological genius and talent. It's taken to extreme degrees, for sure, but never feels far-fetched or silly. The film also shows you can include comedy without it being blatant comic relief, full of forced silliness and one-liners. No the laughter here is genuine, and lots of it. I laughed more in this film than I have in any actual comedy film in a long time.Recent superhero flicks like Batman Begins and Superman Returns were well-made, exciting, and dramatic, but lacked the fun factor. The overall tone of those films is so dour that repeated viewings are a bit of a chore. Then others like the Fantastic Four came out and went in the too far in the other direction, being cheesy and dumb. Iron Man got back to the tone of the first two Superman films and found the perfect balance of drama and comedy.I could go on about every aspect of the film - the supporting players, score, effects... but I'll just say it all clicked. The rest of the summer's flicks are going to have a lot to live up to. I suspect this is the movie people will go back and see again and again, as other summer fare fades away. Just plain fun.","10/10"
"Pixels","robertemerald","14 February 2019","I guess the the way to describe this movie is Ghostbusters lit up in neon. Please see it just for the cgi, it's awesome. If you have the dvd look for the short on how they created one of the cute characters. The comedy is snappy, almost witty, and yet nothing new, but it works. You'll smile rather than laugh out loud. The story is absurd, which is exactly what we pay Hollywood for, and with this one they've outdone themselves. There's a classic chase. There's a great cameo appearance. There's a cleverly worded love affair. There's a great homage to nerds of the 1980s and overall, I thought, a really whacky satire of big budget invasion movies. It's just such fun.","8/10"
"Pixels","joiningjt","29 November 2020","Ignore the reviewers that dont get what this movie is about. It's a scifi comedy movie using the video game craze if the 80s and adding some great 80s music add the phenomenal cast and it's a winner. Its NOT meant to be the godfather or green mile it's a scifi comedy starring adam sandler and Kevin james and it actually out performs its premise. The slapstick script was near flawless and the acting and special effects just bump it to a 10. Watch this fun film with the whole family what it doesn't have is violence, profanity, sex, gross humor, nudity, bad acting.","10/10"

It's fun, nothing's taken too seriously, it's well-acted and well-directed, there's a minimum of the obligatory shock humor that seems to invade all of his movies. I mean, you could probably let the kids watch and that stuff will go over their heads. Maybe, maybe not. Watch it yourself first.I watched it a second time and still enjoyed it. That doesn't happen all that often.","7/10"
"Pixels","chrisgilmer","24 September 2020","I saw some bad reviews on here AFTER watching the movie, so I just thought I would add my own opinion. Why would you hate on a movie like this? Especially if you're my age and remember all these classic games.
The cameos were outstanding, and I didn't expect it to win any Oscars. Man, some people need to lighten up. Was Ghostbusters trashed like this?","8/10"
"Pixels","amesmonde","22 November 2015","Aliens in the guise of video game characters prepare to take over the world and a group of 80s arcade gamers re-team to stop the threat.From the director of Home Alone, Chris Columbus' Pixels plays as a mix of Wreck it Ralph, The Lego Movie and channels the likes of Independence Day and is reminiscent of Ghostbusters to name a few. This highly under-appreciated scifi comedy is a feature-length adaptation of Patrick Jean's video- game themed short. There's something for everyone but if you're a 30 something or more you'll find it hard not to like this retro game blast of a movie complete with arcade slot machine sounds. Opening in 1982 those with an appreciation of the late 70s and early 80s surely can't help but love the throwback gags. It then fast forwards to the present day with Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Peter Dinklage's characters all grown up. It's fast paced fun with aliens disguised as Hervé Villechaize, Madonna and President Reagan. The contemporary cheap quips about Gandalf and Harry Potter also hit the mark. As the grown up nerd gamers assist the President (James) to save the world it's good natured with a flood of one liners, fitting effects and a soundtrack emulating a bygone era. It's packed with references from StarWars to Tron, writers Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling induce nostalgia successfully.The supporting cast include the likes of Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Dan Ackroyd to name a few. There's also some celebrity cameos including Serena Williams and Martha Stewart. Characters from classic arcade games such as Paperboy, Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong among many others appear.Despite scattered anachronisms (who's checking) Columbus' Pixels is sorely underrated, it has great visuals and perfect comedy timing. It also has subtext about today's games. It's very entertaining, even if your 're not a retro gamer or and 8-bit lover, it still comes recommended.","7/10"
"Pixels","FlashCallahan","8 August 2015","When aliens mistake images of 1980s arcade games as a sign of aggression, they attack Earth with evil versions of Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and other video-game characters. In response, the U.S. president asks his old gamer pals to battle the invaders.....I'm one of those rare people who actually like the work of Adam Sandler. Sure, he's made a few Mis-steps in the past couple of years, but despite the fact that he has garnered an unbelievable amount of haters, his films always have at least one bonkers moment.So it's no surprise that this movie would fail, because people would be embarrassed to like the movie, because all the hipsters hate them a bit Adam.Well I most not be hip, because this film gave me what I expected, a fun ninety or so minutes, some funny random moments, Kevin James playing the same role he always does, and Dinkledge stealing the film from everyone.Sandler knows what he's doing, he plays the everyday guy who always gets the girl and always saves the day. It's the predictability of his movies and the movies that Happy Madison produce. He's been doing it for twenty years, so why should he do it any different.The film is basically Ghostbusters, but with video game characters we all know and love as the bad guys. That's the film. We travel to Britain where the depiction of the British is I scenes, but so over the top it's hilarious (I'm British, and it's your stereotypical Hollywood depiction that's been done since the seventies).And then it's back and forth fighting the titular villains until the big finale. Apart from the PAC-MAN sequence, there is nothing new here, the jokes are almost a linear part of a Sandler vehicle, slightly sexist, very moronic, but, they still never fail to make me smile.All in all if you are a fan of Sandler, see it, its nowhere near as bad as what the critics and haters are saying, but then again, in some circles, it's not cool to like films that people disregard before even seeing.I'm glad I'm not in those circles, because I'd miss some brainless fun to make me forget about the stresses of the real world.Man up, and admit you liked it really.","6/10"

I did too, though I knew this wasn't gonna be any greats shakes and it wasn't. There were some funny lines at the beginning and some of the video game gags did go a little well. Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan did well with their roles. When I saw the arcade and all those video games during the 1982 sequence, part of me felt some nostalgia for the times I spent with my brother and his friend playing those games at that kind of place. About the ending sequence taking place one year later: lame. Though really, this was pretty enjoyable so on that note, Pixels is worth a look.","7/10"

"Pixels","Reno-Rangan","4 November 2015","There are plenty of movies related to the video games. The 80s movie 'Tron' was one of those first I have seen, followed by many. But the recent one 'Wreck-it Ralph' was the game changer in the modern animation/CGI which led to another similar flick, 'The Lego Movie'. Lego and 'Toy Story' are the toys, not the video games, but very close to this theme and I'm very happy that Hollywood made this film for the guys like me who grew up playing them.The film had a very simple story with the great visuals. Sometimes simple is very good rather going for hi-tech. Especially those who played these games in their middle-age back in the 80s could be now very old and they might suffer to understand the film due to the technology/terms/phrase gap, if it matched to the todays hi-tech hi-resolution video games. But the youngsters of the present era didn't understand that who are the backbone of any movie's success and that's why this movie sunk in the ocean of criticism.My childhood and teenage was the late 90s and early 00s respectively, So 8bit games are on the edge of revolution. My favourites were the races and brick games, especially 'Duck Hunt', because I get a gun, not joystick. So this movie really brought me those sweet memories. A decade ago I used those unique sounds and music for message alerts in my 2G mobile phone(s).I know recently Sandler had hit the rock bottom in his acting career, but, he's kind of lifted after the decent film 'The Cobbler' and excellent multistarrer 'Men, Women & Children'. This is not a massive comeback to what he's known for, comedies. But, sailing on average or above in better than falling downward in the career graph. To me this film was a better one, an above average, obviously not a masterpiece.Guest appearances were unexpected, but was not that effective, except Ashley Benson, who was so hot in her 2-3 odd minutes. This film is not for everyone. Youngsters and oldsters never understand it. If you were born in the 70s and 80s, then probably you will know what to expect. Even it does not deliver to your expectation, definitely gives satisfaction for bringing those lost memories of our childhood.7/10","10/10"
"Pixels","Pumpkin_Man","25 July 2015","Wow, I can't believe so many people are hating this movie just because it has Adam Sandler in it. I think it has the potential to become a cult classic years down the road. The idea of video game aliens coming from outer space to attack us and the only hope to defend mankind are some video game nerds from the 80's who knew what gaming is all about. I'm a Sandler fan, and there were actually times where Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage had funnier lines. This review WILL contain spoilers!In 1982, Sam Brenner and Will Cooper count down the days to when the new video game arcade opens. They enter a video game competition and are up against Eddie Plant, who is a pro at playing Donkey Kong. Meanwhile, NASA sends up a time capsule to outer space with 1980's culture of video games and clips from TV shows as a sign of peace in hopes to make contact with alien life. (This is the Adam Sandler video game version of 'Battleship' 33 years later, Sam Brenner works for a tech company and his best friend, Will is now the President of the United States. The world is soon attacked by video game characters because the aliens took the message the wrong way. They send down Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Mario, Space Invaders, Arkanoid and Tetris. Sam, Will, Eddie, and conspiracy theorist Ludlow must team up and stop the video game aliens from destroying and pixelating the world. This is a cheesy fun ride. Don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it. I would definitely recommend PIXELS!!!","10/10"
"Pixels","RNMorton","25 July 2015","I suspect those panning this film didn't live in the 80s. This is fun from the word go as Dinklage, Gad, Sandler and James save the world from an invasion of 80's arcade monsters. When the going gets tough, the nation has to turn to the nerds as an alien race attacks the Earth with warriors based on old arcade games. A ship was sent out to contact other races in the 1980's, and what was meant as a peace gesture was interpreted as a threat. I found some of Sandler's recent movies not as funny, but to me this one puts him right back in the comedy driver's seat. All the supporting characters are right, including Dinklage as Sandler's old arcade nemesis. Ignore the other reviews and go and enjoy enjoy enjoy.","9/10"
"Pixels","mcgregorrowland","7 August 2015","A 5.5 on IMDb. Really? This movie was not bad! It was funny, action packed, and just all out fun.The idea and the storyline of this movie was very good. It was very creative and it brought back memories of older games such as PAC-MAN, Galaga, and Donkey Kong. The CGI for all the animated game characters was awesome. The cartoony animation was absolutely great and made the characters fit in well with the real world.The comedy was hilarious! I found myself laughing very hard at times and it was just great, classic Happy Madison humor. Part of this was because of the acting which was great by the way. Everyone keeps saying that Adam Sandler is not funny anymore but I disagree. He still was funny at times to me and I thought he did good acting. Kevin James as the president was hysterical. Michelle Monaghan did great. But the two who were just hilarious and almost made you cry because they were so funny was Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad. They were so funny and the stuff they said and did was totally laugh out loud funny.Surprisingly, the action in this movie was really good. The PAC-MAN car chase, the Donkey Kong battle, and the video games attacking the city was great action and there were some cool new stunts I have never seen before and that was nice to see in a comedy film.If you love the old time video games, Happy Madison, good, laugh out loud comedy, and some cool and comical action then you will love this movie. Sit back, don't take it too seriously, and enjoy this fun film.","8/10"

But will they save the day before it's too late?Like some of Adam Sandler comedies, this is not a great film, but it never tries to be, but it is entertaining, I did laugh a few, end enjoyed the effects. Adam Sandler is good, so was Michelle Monaghan, I won't forget Kevin James. But the real scene steelers that take the cake are Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad, they get the most funny lines, and never go too far over the top. I enjoyed this movie, it never tries to be anything more than what it is, just a fun time, sometimes that is all you need.

Whoever hasn't see this should take this a look, it's a really fun action film!I never was disappointed or bothered that the video game characters were taking over earth because really, they added so much effect which is exciting even if it's meant to be scary.

"Pixels","StevePulaski","26 July 2015","The immense hate for ""Pixels"" has me asking a serious question for those who hate the film, did you hate the concept or did you simply find yourself refusing any inkling of positivity or humor whilst watching the film upon seeing Adam Sandler as the top-billed actor? I ask this question as somebody who finds myself at odds with Sandler on most of his projects, but also somebody willing to admit his achievements and provide him with credit when he deserves it.I ask this because it seems the good majority of the public, and critics for that matter, have given up on Adam Sandler, ostensibly just waiting to hate the next project he's working on before it's even released. The negative buzz around ""Pixels,"" similar to ""Blended,"" Sandler's last feature, started early and never let up. While Sandler has given himself plenty of reasons (and films, for that matter) to dislike him and his work, I feel under the work of any other actor besides Sandler and his production company, ""Pixels"" would've at least garnered a handful of defenders.""Pixels"" is a brazenly silly sound and lights show, one that works predominately because of its willingness to exhaust its premise and use many actors with differing personalities to carry the entire show. That, right there, is about all I can say for the film: it's cheeky, it's relentlessly goofy, but it's also just funny enough and adventurous enough to recommend to anyone searching for that piece of entertainment in the cool multiplexes during this hot summer.The film opens with Sam Brenner and Will Cooper, two best friends who spend their days at the arcade, where Sam discovers his incredible skill for video games. Will encourages him to compete in the first video game championship of 1982, which will be recorded and sent into space by NASA, along with other artifacts. At the tournament, however, Sam winds up losing to Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage), a cocky, professional video gamer.Decades later, Sam (Adam Sandler) works as an installer of software and his pal Will (Kevin James) goes on to be The President of the United States, still both very close friends despite their difference in power. One day, Will calls Sam into the office to observe an attack on a military base in Guam by what looks to be the video game pixels and characters from the arcade game Galaga. Baffled by the insanity of this possibility, Sam reconnects with Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), a pudgy conspiracy theorist whom he met at at the video game tournament back in the 1980's. Ludlow shows Sam a video claiming to be sent from aliens that the video tape of the tournament was seen as a declaration of war, prompting the aliens to send the video game characters from classic arcade games to attack the world. The world gets ""three lives,"" so to speak, which are lost if one particular battle (video game) is lost. Three lost battles and the Earth is terminated.Desperate and out of options, Will orders Sam, Ludlow, Eddie, and his unique weapons specialist Lieutenant Colonel Violent van Patten (Michell Monaghan) to fight the pixelated monsters, which come in the form of Centipede, Pac-Man, and eventually Donkey Kong.It shouldn't take more than a minute of watching the trailer for ""Pixels"" to decide if you'd want to see something like this. Those who do, if they view the film as the basic summer entertainment that the film is trying to be, will find a perfectly acceptable and balanced dose of fun. ""Pixels"" also works as a showcase for a divisive array of talent. We have Sandler, who is surprisingly very relaxed and nonchalant throughout the whole film, James, who is toned down several notches from his usual self as well, Gad, who bears the same kind of energy Sandler did in his heyday, only with much more personality, and Dinklage, who's narcissism and brazen attitude effectively make his character.Finally, ""Pixels"" works because it doesn't take itself too seriously; it knows exactly what it needs to do to succeed and that is to be a nonstop display of action with a great visual scheme and characters that are at least somewhat fun to be around. This may not be a showstopper of a film, but it's something that definitely caters to a season of films where numerous other, lesser films find themselves being defended while ""Pixels"" sits and suffers in a ""guilt by association"" manner.","8/10"
"Pixels","Aktham_Tashtush","10 October 2015","I still can't believe there are many bad reviews for this one .. and i can't believe that the rating is just 5.6 !! it easily deserve an 8 >>The story of the movie is new .. fresh concept ... amazing script .. i laughed on so many scenes especially when Sandler starts making fun of others >> LOOOL when he said ""okay blue lagoon"" or when he was leaving the room in the white house and started making fun of every one !! Gosh . Peter Dinklage negotiating with the president :D .. Tim Herlihy from amazing run on Saturday Night Live he really showed some great potentials. So as i said there were an action and thrill but those never overpowered the Comedy part which thankfully defined the movie itself.As for the cast .. they were all HILARIOUS .. Adam Sandler, Kevin James , Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage they did one hell of amazing job to make such a comedy movie ""saying comedy just for those who reviewed it as a bad sci-fi movie"" oh relax it is a comedy of funny pixels attacking Earth not star wars.Overall ... i loved it .. and i have no idea why i only now watched instead of a couple months ago. .. so it is recommended and no need for any slightest reason to read the bad reviews. Hope you enjoy it like i did ;)","8/10"
"Pixels","Anurag-Shetty","3 August 2015","Pixels revolves around four incredibly talented gaming nerds namely, Brenner(Adam Sandler), Cooper(Kevin James), Eddie(Peter Dinklage) & Ludlow(Josh Gad). When these four guys were kids, they took part in the 1982 National Arcade Championship. The footage from this competition & footage of other popular culture, would be sent to outer space by NASA via a space probe, in hopes of communicating with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Unfortunately, the aliens interpret these messages as a declaration of war. They attack Earth in the form of famous arcade video games like, Pac-Man, Centipede, Donkey Kong etc. Now, it is up to Brenner, Cooper, Eddie & Ludlow along with the help of lieutenant Violet(Michelle Monaghan), to teach the US army how to fend off these alien lifeforms. Together, they must utilize all the knowledge, experience & expertise they have to defeat these classic arcade video games in real life, before they take over the planet. Pixels is an extremely funny & entertaining movie. The special effects of the movie are very unique. CGI has never been portrayed like this on screen, ever before. The makers of the movie have successfully recreated all our favorite video games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong & the rest. The fact that all the video game characters are made of pixels in real life, just like in their respective games, is amazing. The riot of colors during all the battles against the alien invaders is otherworldly. The set pieces where many famous monuments of the world get destroyed are spectacular. The Pac-Man set piece in New York is one of the highlights of the film. The 3D, puts the viewer right in the middle of the action. Chris Columbus successfully helms another family film. A tiny flaw of the movie is that, given all the never before seen, revolutionary visual effects, they could have made an unforgettable movie. However, the generic script makes this movie, mostly forgettable. Don't get me wrong! This movie is hugely entertaining. But, it could have been so much more. Adam Sandler is great as Brenner. Kevin James is awesome as Cooper. Michelle Monaghan is brilliant as Violet. Peter Dinklage is the highlight of the movie as Eddie. Dinklage's character steals the show, in every scene he's in. I just wish he had more screen time. Josh Gad is hysterical as Ludlow. Matt Lintz is impressive as Matty. Brian Cox & Sean Bean are good as Admiral Porter & Corporal Hill(SAS Officer) respectively. Jane Krakowski is effective as First Lady Jane Cooper. Ashley Benson is smoldering as Lady Lisa. Dennis Akiyama is hilarious in his cameo as Professor Iwatani. The supporting characters are effective. So, get ready to feel nostalgic as you see your favorite video game characters come to life on the big screen. Pixels is super fun for the whole family & is worth a watch.","8/10"
"Pixels","angelamparo","29 September 2015","I'm really not quite sure what the film critics were expecting from this film. It's a movie about a video game apocalypse starring Adam Sandler. What in the world were they expecting? Citizen Kane? The Godfather? The problem with these so-called film critics today is that they're impervious to accepting anything at face value. I believe it got such awful review from critics because it starred a lot of big name actors and maybe they expected more substance from them; but you have to look at the source material before making those determinations. This is a tongue-in-cheek slapstick comedy that's meant to entertain people especially those who grew up in the 80's and can relate to the video game evolution nostalgia of that time. If you watch this movie with that mindset, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.","10/10"
"Pixels","trooper5783","25 July 2015","Saw the 1:30 3D screening of this movie- don't believe the disrespectful critics who are hypocritical and have no heart for underrated movies like this!! I'll have you know, the audience I was with knew what they came for. They consistently laughed at the comedy, was dazzled by the visual effects, and clapped their hands at certain parts whether a joke or a visual effect was done well. The jokes are hilarious- whether it be visual or verbal. If you see this film, screen the 3D version- you won't be disappointed. A lot of the action and destruction scenes are wonderfully done- CGI or not. Not a lot of ""bodily functions"" or ""raunchy"" humor- and when it does crack a gross-out joke, it's actually funny!! Great callbacks to 80s pop culture. Stay for the credits also- it's a very cool pix-elated sequence that sums up the events of the picture. Don't believe the haters who probably don't have a good sense of humor or imagination- go with your friends and/or family, get a bucket of popcorn, relax and enjoy the show!! I have nothing to fault about this film, and I'm not going to feel sorry for that statement.","9/10"
"Pixels","mattkratz","5 October 2015","I grew up on 80s classic arcade games, and that was one of the main reasons I wanted to see this movie. That and the interesting concept. I enjoyed the idea of a movie where kids would win a video game tournament, and they would send those games and other stuff into space in hopes that aliens would find it;the aliens did and misinterpret as a declaration of war and retaliate with those games! Adam Sandler and Kevin James were the perfect choices for the leads. Especially Adam Sandler. I liked the choices of the ""battle games"" with Gallaga, Centipede, Pac Man, and Donkey Kong, and cameos by Frogger, QBert, and others. My favorite scenes include Kevin James in the school (reminiscent of George W Bush!), the battle scenes, and the scene in the prison. Anyone nostalgic about these games will enjoy this movie. It was hilarious! ** 1/2 out of ****","9/10"
"Pixels","CleveMan66","24 July 2015","When I first read about the premise of the movie ""Pixels"" (PG-13, 1:45) – early 1980s video arcade games coming ""to life"" and attacking the earth – I thought that it was a really original and fun idea. The feature film is based on an award-winning 2010 French short film of the same name, which simply shows some of these 8-bit game images and characters emanating from an old television set and turning objects and buildings into pixelated versions of themselves. (The short film is only about 2 ½ minutes long and is available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUnyUrA34bQ.) I felt that expanding this simple idea into a feature-length science fiction action comedy was brilliant and held a lot of potential. Then I learned that the movie starred Adam Sandler and Kevin James whose last few films haven't exactly been their best. Yet, I still hoped that this movie would signal a return to form for those two talented and accomplished comic actors and also that the filmmakers wouldn't screw up what could be a very cool movie. So, was my optimism justified? In my opinion, yes! That's right, folks. It is, of course, my opinion (although not ""just"" mine, as I'll explain later), but I really think that this is one of those times to ignore the professional critics and listen to a fellow Movie Fan. ""Pixels"" is terrific! Sandler is Sam Brenner, an erstwhile nationally-ranked arcade gamer who hasn't done much with his life since his success in the first National Arcade Game Championship in 1982. He now works for ""Nerd Brigade"" (a fictionalized version of companies like ""Geek Squad"") and he still hangs out with Will Cooper (James), his best friend from back in the day. (Although it's revealed very early in the film, I won't tell you what Will does for a living in the present because finding out is a real hoot!) When earth comes under alien attack (meaning alien, as in outer space – don't be frightened, Mr. Trump), in order to save the world as only they can, Sam and Will reunite with other former ""arcaders"", Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), who ""lacks the social skills"" and is obsessed with conspiracy theories, along with Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage), who is over-the-top arrogant and of questionable moral fiber.Video footage from that 1982 competition was put in a time capsule and sent into space where it was discovered by an alien race and misinterpreted. The unnamed aliens took the tape as a challenge to do the galactic equivalent of ""racing for pinks"". This other planet sends giant versions of our classic arcade games to fight earthlings in a series of battles, with the first planet to get to ""game over"" three times taking the other's planet as a prize. With the support of the President (and to the dismay of military leaders played by Brian Cox and Sean Bean), Sam and company link up with weapons designer Lt. Colonel Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) to fight high energy light with high energy light.As the attacks unfold, the pixels (actually, voxels, because they're presented as three-dimensional cubes and the film is in 3-D) take the form of a different classic arcade game each time, announce their next attack via re-dubbed versions of early 1980s news and entertainment video clips, and commence to pixelate everything from ordinary objects to famous buildings to people, which is how they capture humans and transport them to their spaceship as war trophies.""Pixels"" both is and isn't your typical Adam Sandler movie. It's more high concept than most of his other Happy Madison Productions, but has typical Sandler-esque elements such as his character's friendship with a young boy and budding romance with a beautiful woman, plenty of 1980s music (including one of those songs amusingly sung on stage by one of the film's characters) and cultural references from that decade, some of his usual crew in the cast (although not as many as usual), a few well-done celebrity cameos and a moral of the story which includes underdogs making good and rising above their personal histories. There's some juvenile humor, but this script features better jokes than most of Sandler's recent comedies, while the sure hand of director Chris Columbus (director of two ""Home Alone"" movies, two ""Harry Potter"" movies and many others) maintains great pacing and keeps things very entertaining.The special effects are crude, but that's by design since the attackers take the form of decades old video game characters, which don't have nearly as many pixels as those in today's games. However, the filmmakers cleverly use the rules of those old games to drive the movie's plot. Those who remember the 80s will appreciate this film the most, but it also appeals to those born long after The Me Decade ended, as I observed in the reactions of my fellow theater patrons and as a young lady and young man (15 and 16-years-old, respectively) with whom I spoke after the movie confirmed. Better than previous 80s video game movie adaptations like ""Tron"", ""Pixels"" is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time! And isn't that what going to the theater is all about? This is a movie that ISN'T supposed to be realistic and IS supposed to be silly and fun. Lighten up, critics. As this review ends, the pixels on my computer screen form the letter ""A"".","7/10"
"Pixels","district-23105","2 July 2017","I don't understand why there's so much hatred for Pixels. It was just silly dumb fun. Sure, it's an Adam Sandler movie, which, I'm sure for many, reduces the score by 1, but it looks great, it's fast-paced, and as long as you turn your brain off and go for the ride, it's just great family entertainment.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it; it's filled with charm and quirky characters (and stereotypes) and the effects really are spectacular.Check it out, but seriously, don't expect earth-shattering scripts or anything even remotely of any depth. The story is about one pixel deep, but the movie has plenty of heart and it's funny, too!","10/10"
"Pixels","cashmere-12","31 July 2015","Wasn't sure if we should see this movie or not reading some of the reviews on IMDb. My daughter wanted to see it and nothing else was playing so we went. We enjoyed it so much. It was funny and the 80's songs through out the movie were great. Once in awhile you would hear a little Olaf from Frozen come through seeing the actor who voiced him was in this movie. Adam Sandler was pretty good in this not his goofy self. It is just a fun movie to see.The Pac Man scene was good with the mini coopers. Donkey Kong was great too. The special effects were good. Go see this movie and judge for yourself.","9/10"
"Pixels","The-Sarkologist","12 September 2015","Okay, a movie paying tribute to 80s video games was always going to attract my attention, but to be honest with you I never expected the film to be anywhere near as good, or even as silly, as this one. Actually, when it comes to silliness I probably shouldn't have been at all surprised, especially since we have a movie where the characters from these old video games attack Earth, and any movie in which the major characters are chasing Pacman around New York City in coloured mini coopers is definitely not going to be on the serious list.However, when it comes to silly movies there are those that are just plain silly and you spend the entire movie shaking your head wandering what possessed even the conservative powers that be in Hollywood to come up with such a concept, and then you get classic Adam Sandler. In fact, ever since The Waterboy I simply no longer expected Sandler to come anywhere near the level of the films that launched him to stardom – yet here we have Pixels and here we have Sandler back to his hilarious best.Yep, that's right – not only is the film about how characters from 1980s video games invade the Earth, but it is actually really, really funny as well. Okay, at the beginning where we are introduced to a young Sam Brenner who knows how to beat video games by reading the patterns but losing to a dwarf at the world championships and thus being only the second-best video gamer in the world, it seems that it is simply going to be your standard silly movie. However jump to the present where it turns out that Sam Brenner's best friend has become the President of the United States, and they still catch up for a regular chat, you suddenly realise that it is going to be one of those movies and you know that you aren't supposed to take it seriously.This film brought back an awful lot of memories, but then again I suspect that this was the film's main purpose: to remind us children of the 80s of all the fun that we used to have down at the video arcades playing classic games such as Space Invaders, Frogger, and Centipede. Sure, you can still play those games over the internet, but as Sam suggested, games these days simply aren't the same. They don't run on patterns but rather on the principle of trying to stay alive as long as possible (and if that doesn't work then pressing the reset key). In fact they brought back lots of the characters that we remember from the golden days of computer gaming, including Donkey Kong (which was one of the original platform games).I guess I can also relate to Sam somewhat, being a kid who spent as much time as possible trying to beat computer games and then landing up in an ordinary job simply because computer game skills are simply not transferable. Sure, Sam is a computer geek, but his best friend became the President of the United States while he is installing hardware in people's houses. He even displays the geeky tendencies of simply not being able to relate to women in the way that most people are able to relate to them (though a part of that has to do with the silliness of the entire film). Of course, it does run along the standard Hollywood storyline where the protagonist, whom society has passed by, becomes the saviour of the world (and gets the girl in the end).While I don't want to spoil the film, I have to say that I loved the end credits. Once again it brings back memories of the days when computer graphics were incredibly basic – not the almost life like incarnations of games that you get these days. While it is promoted as a kids movie (particularly with the trailers for the films at the beginning), in many ways this is a film for those of us who spent way to much time pumping quarters into games at the local video arcade, or stuck in front of our Commodore 64s relentlessly trying to get that frog across the road.","9/10"
"Pixels","rannynm","25 July 2015","From Donkey Kong to Pac-man, from Adam Sandler to Josh Gad, this film really has anything you could imagine. Pixels is the funniest film of the year so far!This is, of course, a comedy. However, along with that, there is a lot of drama and a hint of romance all packed into one huge adventure made for the entire family to enjoy.The story features Brenner (Adam Sandler) who installs electronic equipment for a living. However, when an alien species attacks in the form of 1980s classic video games, Benner and his friends are the only ones capable of stopping them. And, to do so, they must beat the aliens, as if they were in the game.This film is fantastic! The special effects are absolutely mind blowing. There are no boring scenes and some special effects are simply mind-blowing fantastic. I still can't figure out how they did it some of them. The acting is spot on. One scene I really liked is where two kids are competing on classic arcade machines with Donkey Kong loaded on them. The director makes it so you see them playing, their points and the screen as well as the reflection of the games in their eyes. It looks amazingzing!My favorite scene is when they are facing Pac-Man in mini coopers that are designed to be the ghosts who chase and destroy Pac-Man. When Brenner is the only one left and Pac-Man just gets a power up which allows him to eat the ghosts, Brenner pulls of an awesome and insane stunts to run away and it is action packed and just stupendous to watch!This film is good for kids, adults and gamers of course. I do believe people in their 30s and 40s would like this the most because they can understand a lot of the older game references. I don't think younger kids should watch this due to the adult language and mature references. I recommend it for ages 9 through 18 and older and give it 5 out of 5 pixelated stars.

"Pixels","packor","29 July 2015","*there is a tiny amount of spoiling in this review*I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Like other Sandler films, this one is mostly over-the-top comedy. Nothing particular to note.However, I know it's not supposed to be serious, but there are some things that I wish would be more sensible. Trained soldiers can't even aim and hit a target properly, while a person untrained in the use of arms can just pick up a heavy weapon and nail everything because of ""video game experience"". Having ""cheat codes"" for an arcade game when it'd be impossible to even enter any on the console, and being able to even cheat without anyone spotting it when you have a mass audience. Just a few plot holes that you're just expected to go with because it's not a serious story. Otherwise, the film is perfect considering what kind of movie it is.What really made me gave this 10 points is the ending. The short scene after the black out and the animations in the credits were spectacular; very nicely wrapped up.","8/10"
"Pixels","neil-476","14 August 2015","Aliens intercept a videotape containing recordings of old videogames and interpret it as a declaration of war. They invade Earth and attack with giant versions of classic video game characters. A small group of people who once played those games as kids are earth's only hope.If you remember Ghostbusters, Pixels will seem very familiar – the same gang of weirdos are up against the enemy, only instead of ghosts we have computer game characters, with Donkey Kong taking centre stage during the final act rather than the Marshmallow Man. The blocky retro video game graphics are nicely realised, even though Wreck-it Ralph did the gag first two years ago.The plot is full of stuff which stretches credibility: Kevin James, playing the familiar Kevin James character, is President of the USA – oh, really? Josh Gad's Ludlow is halfway between ludicrously gay and ludicrously hetero, with the contradiction never explained, and the way Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan are brought together is typical movie artifice.But Pixels is silly movie to start off with, so this doesn't really really matter. Sandler thankfully offers his affable cleverdick character rather than one of his odious ""funny voice"" characters, and his bickering with Monaghan is played nicely. Peter Dinklage is great, and Brian Cox and Sean Bean both have fun while chewing some scenery.The cinema was almost full, with many kids, and they all enjoyed it. As did I.","10/10"
"Pixels","fuzzhead72","4 September 2015","I've been hooked on video games, especially the classic ones, since I played Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Wizard of Wor, Frogger, Donkey Kong (etc., etc., etc.) at the arcades from the late 70's through mid 80's, and of course on home systems afterwards. My kids have played many of these classic arcade games on MAME and on compilation disks on the Gamecube. We absolutely loved Wreck It Ralph, so when I heard that there was another video game themed movie coming out, I was looking forward to watching it.I wasn't able to get to the theater for the first month, but then it was showing at a local drive-in as the second feature. I went to watch it with my oldest son, who is not quite a teen yet. We were pretty bored by the first feature, which was a failed attempt to reboot yet another 60's TV show. However, Pixels really captured our attention, and we both loved the humor and the video game action.I could have done without the reference to Martha Stewart that they put in there, and I would have liked to see maybe 4 or 5 more classic video games featured. I also would have liked for there to be some form of personal appearance by the alien A.I. in charge. Overall, however, I think it was the most fun my son and I had watching a movie this summer, and we've watched more than a dozen. After we watched it, he came home and played a bunch of the old video games for a few hours. I finally bought Pac Man Championship Edition DX+.It certainly isn't a blockbuster, but with the international box office, it will finish at about 2.5 times its budget, so it will ultimately be another profitable movie. Is it the greatest movie of the year? No, but it would be a good choice for anybody who has played classic arcade games through the mid 80's.","6/10"
"Pixels","ioio32l","28 July 2015","I enjoyed it, Pixels is much better than people say. It has some really funny parts, and if you grew up in the 80's and played some old games you will like this I am betting. Of course there are some silly parts, but that's how all Adam Sandler movies are. It reminded me a bit of Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. It was fun to watch.Ignore the reviews from critics, the SJW's these days will find anything to complain about and they did with this movie too. They want everything, whether it be a movie, video game, or comic book to cater to them. Anything they find offensive immediately they claim to be insulting and they will overlook anything good about the movie just so they can talk negatively about it. Never listen to an SJW when it comes to reviews, they are awful critics.Watch a movie, and judge it for yourself.","10/10"
"Pixels","Rageypoo","29 July 2015","After watching the movie, I can understand why people have mixed feelings about it. You can certainly feel the Sandler moments, they were evident from the very beginning and all through the movie, some of them were great, some were kinda ""meh"" so I get why some people are blaming him. I will say however that I can't see this particular movie working the way it did without anyone other than him, for one very obvious reason; the writing. The movie tries hard to tell a story from a VERY lighthearted perspective and basically far out ""would probably never happen"" world, that being 2 kids who played video games at a young age, turned out to be the president of the united states, and a TV install guy. The flow of the movie seemed to take the situation of alien invaders VERY lightly, at one point they all went out to drink beers. If this movie was indeed written around the actors, then the whole scenario makes sense, since this is very Sander heavy, but I think considering the scope of the movie and what it could have brought to the table, it leaves audiences feeling a bit unsatisfied. Perhaps extending the movie a bit, and throwing in a few more realistic character developments would have greatly helped draw audiences into the story. I found myself not caring about many of the aspects of the movie, because of the cheesy writing, but I will applaud the CGI that went into this movie, it's absolutely amazing what we are able to do, and they certainly went the extra mile to bring pixels to life. The way of defeating them was certainly unbelievable, and the fact that they were able to figure it out so fast was unbelievable. I think since the aliens were presenting them with the game, they would have also presented them with a tool to defeat them, so the light gun should have came from them, not the military. I also think the girl should have been taken for donkey kong, as it makes more sense. I dunno, there just seems to be odd writing choices through, but much of it I did enjoy regardless, I mean it's still an Adam Sander movie and for some reason we just can't get enough. at LEAST a 7, certainly not a 5.3 the current ratings are giving. This movie is certainly a throwback to kids from that time, so anyone between the ages of 25-35 should appreciate it.","6/10"
"Pixels","Leofwine_draca","22 January 2018","You know, I had every reason not to like PIXELS. It's a Hollywood blockbuster comedy with an emphasis on special effects over story, and it's directed by Chris Columbus, a man known for his twee, family-centred productions. It even stars Adam Sandler, who I'm no fan of. Despite all these detractions, I found PIXELS to be a breath of fresh air in a tired world. It's fast and funny, and a treat for anyone who grew up in the 1980s with 1980s-era video games. The film plays out as one big action set-piece with jokes in between, and thank goodness, there's no crudity for once. Sandler himself is okay and Kevin James is a hoot as the bad-mannered president. Peter Dinklage is the real scene-stealer of the group, though, and there are fun cameos from famous names including Dan Ackroyd and Sean Bean. The film's CGI effects are exemplary and just as good as in a massive budget blockbuster like AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, and that city-wide climax is something to behold. Check it out!","9/10"

"Pixels","Bravesfan17","2 August 2015","Chris Columbus and Adam Sandler are two people in the film industry whose movies I grew up with and still enjoy up to today. Columbus gave us Home Alone, Adventures in Babysitting, and Mrs. Doubtfire. Sandler gave us Happy Gilmore, Mr. Deeds, and Big Daddy. Now, they have combined their efforts to give us a new film that also took me back with Pixels.The film begins with adolescent versions of Sam Brenner and Will Cooper, who are checking out the new video game arcade that just opened. There, they also meet and befriend Ludlow Lamonsoff. They all get involved in a huge video game tournament where footage of all the kids playing video games will be sent into outer space. The finals come down to Sam and another kid named Eddie Plant. Eddie beats Sam in a game of Donkey Kong. Years later, they have all lived different lives. Will (Kevin James) has become President of the United States, while Sam (Adam Sandler) has become a tech installer. Ludlow (Josh Gad) has become a conspiracy theorist. Will has called in Sam to look at some footage he has of a military base in Guam, thinking it might have something to do with a video game they played when they were kids. It turns out that the attackers are an alien race who interpreted the video of kids playing video games as a declaration of war. When the military isn't trained for defending the world against video games, it is up to Sam and Ludlow to save the world before their three lives are up.While Adam Sandler is well know for his low brow, goofy characters, this time around he has toned down the goofiness a lot. There is still a little bit of a goofball, but compared to his fellow cast members, his role is a bit more straight. Kevin James as the adult Will Cooper is also in more of straight part. Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage, who plays the adult version of Eddie Plant, have the crazy goofball roles in this one. Both Gad and Dinklage are riots in their parts and you can tell they are having a lot of fun with their roles. Veteran character actor Brian Cox is also a lot of fun in his part as a crusty old admiral who is not particularly happy with how the President is handling the crisis at hand. Michelle Monaghan is also decent as Colonel Violet Van Patten, a single mother with a young son who is also called into action during the crisis.Chris Columbus delivers us a fun film with a lot of references to the old video games such as Donkey Kong, Pac Man, and Centipede. Columbus is having a lot of fun with this, mixing in the action and the comedy, and showing that he still has something for us. Now Columbus did have to go to the different companies who made each video game and get permission to use their characters. But with what he was able to get, he certainly shows respect for the characters and still gives the audience something entertaining.The visual effects are outstanding. I like how the visual effects team made all the video game characters look like they came right out of the machine rather than some new, and improved CGI. With this, it feels more in line with the games from the 80's.Pixels is a fun film for everyone. The kids will get some enjoyment and interest in the story and situations, while the adults will get to see some of their favorite video game characters come alive on screen.","7/10"
"Pixels","nogodnomasters","24 March 2018","This is an Adam Sandler movie so it automatically has lovers and haters with parents wondering if their kids can watch it. The film opens in 1982 with kids playing in an arcade championship with the tape being sent into space by NASA for aliens. Years later when Kevin James is POTUS and Sandler is on the NERD Brigade installing TV systems, the world is attacked by aliens using video games tactics. Only the old time players have the ability to defeat them, sort of like ""Ghost Busters"" but not nearly as funny.For those who like movies based on video games, this one goes over the top. The script is formula with minor twists but not real surprises. The language was iffy as it uses the word ""b***h"" which made the kids giggle. There was 1 F-bomb. There is some talk about sex such as making a Martha Stewart, Serena Williams sandwich. Definite PG-13 stuff.Adam Sandler managed to score minor roles for his wife and kids. There are some fun scenes with era music and people, even though some came after 1982 creating anachronisms.Good mindless fun, aimed at teens who were around in 1982 and wormholed into the present.","8/10"

Although the movie doesn't have great appeal to adults, it certainly does have appeal for its intended audience 12 - 15yr olds.I found it thoroughly entertaining, and the young man I took to see it was very engaged.The humor was dry and good, and the visuals were very pleasing on the eye. The storyline was totally ridiculous, but despite that, it worked well! Normally I wouldn't bother rating or reviewing this type of movie, but because I got a pleasant surprise, I thought I'd pass it on.It was entertaining and enjoyable - and that's all that matters! If the theme of the movie appeals, then go and see it, if you aren't sure, then watch it on your streaming choice on a miserable day - it will cheer you up!!! It's a whole lot better than doing yard work!!!!","8/10"
"Pixels","TxMike","11 December 2015","Like most Adam Sandler movies there is a lot of foolishness, but most of it is fun foolishness. I enjoyed it, my wife didn't see it, not her kind of entertainment.The story starts in 1982 when the main characters were boys who enjoyed the video games of the day, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, those sorts that you would actually go to an arcade to play.Then in modern times as the boys are approaching 50 there is a crisis that threatens the very existence of Earth. Seems back in the 1980s a deep space probe contained a VHS recording of certain aspects of our society, in the hopes of someday reaching another civilized world. But these aliens mistook the video games for our form of battle and are invading Earth. Maybe the men who were video game champions back in the 1980s can save the world.Adam Sandler is the main gamer, Brenner, who in current times is an installer working for a business that sells TVs, sound systems, and the like. Kevin James is his good buddy Cooper who now happens to be president of the USA. When the crisis starts Cooper calls Brenner for help.One of the military leaders is Michelle Monaghan as Violet. Brenner's old gaming nemesis is Peter Dinklage as Eddie, currently in prison. The other friend is Josh Gad (way too young to be a kid from the 1980s) as Ludlow.The story includes its share of slapstick comedy. The aliens strike at such places as India, London, and New York City. The graphics are very impressive and overall a fun diversion for those of us who enjoy Sandler movies.","6/10"

"Pixels","daviddevilliers54","30 September 2015","When I read the reviews, I was about to say to myself, ""If the movie is this bad, why watch it?"" The I just walked into the video shop and me and my friend wanted to choose the worst movie to see how long we could survive. We took Pixels. That's when I thought to myself, ""Man, this is a great movie! Why do the critics have to be so down on it?"" Yes, it has some silliness in it but what can we say, this is an Adam Sandler film. Of course it won't be the comedy we most adore. This film is different and deserves a chance on the shelf. When aliens intercept video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) in an all-out battle to save the planet.","6/10"
"Pixels","AlukardsCastle","4 August 2015","I was excited for this movie. I knew the critics were going to go hard on it. I knew that most of the so called professional critics weren't even going to see the movie and would trash it based solely on Adam Sandler and Kevin James. I don't blindly hate Adam Sandler like most of the drones nowadays. Sure he had horrible movies in the past few years like Jack and Jill, the Grown Ups movies, and Thats My Boy. But he's had more hit than miss. He's even proved he can be a dramatic actor in his masterful performance in Punch Drunk Love, which I wish he would try again. So seeing the trailers for this really intrigued me. I knew not to expect much substance. I just knew it was going to be a fun comedy action movie. When the movie was finally in theaters my predictions of the unwarranted hateful reviews were spot on. But did that stop me from going to see it? Heck no. I've learned long ago not to trust movie critics most of the time. Sometimes their right. This isn't one of those times. *Plot* I'm sure you already know the basics. The US sends a message containing cultural phenomena such as video games, movies and music out into space in the 80s. Years later the aliens come back having taken the message as an act of war and are attacking the Earth in various countries in the form of classic video games. It's up to the presidents life long best friend, a video game arcade champion from childhood and current home theater installer adult to save the day with help from other video game virtuosos. What unfolds is a series of battles in the form of 'stages' in video games to help save the earth from these aliens. Yes, it's ludicrous. Yes, Adam Sandler is a hero in this movie. Yes, Kevin James is the president. So what? This movie was very funny. I don't know what the critics were talking about this time especially. The jokes weren't flat. I haven't laughed this much at an Adam Sandler movie in years. It was also good. Sure there were some moments that made me roll my eyes, like the whole side plot of romance. Also, Adam Sandler had a few funny lines, but he's not even the real star of this movie. The real stars are the supporting cast and the video game representations which were spot on. Josh Gad was so funny it hurt. Peter Dinklage was painfully hilarious. And as far as Kevin James being president goes, he did a good job at being funny but restrained at the same time. I'm sure most people were assuming he would be the wacky character of Paul Blart in a presidents suit. Wrong. Even the kids who played the young versions of the characters in the beginning did a great job. The theater I was in was full of laughter throughout at least 90% of the movie. Oh and the soundtrack was superb in catching the style of the 80s. The action scenes were intense. The visual effects used to created the classic video game characters were done so perfectly. But again there were action parts that were so over the top that they were lame such as Adam Sandlers character driving in reverse off of a parking garage and shooting the enemy dead before safely landing on a lower buildings roof. But then I remembered 'Why shouldn't I believe that when I'm believing that these video game characters are out and about?'. Exactly, some critics who actually saw the movie took the unbelievable plot too seriously. The low score on many sites surely affected its Box Office. But mark my words, the reviews and comments from people who actually saw the movie and loved it, are in the majority and they will help this movie rebound into the cult classic it's destined to be. Here's an example. When the movie first came out, its score on this website was a meager 4.4/10. Less than two weeks, and the day I'm typing this review the score has risen to 5.5/10. Though not a high score, this does show that the reviews are quickly getting more positive. As the negative scalding reviews are starting to get lost in the crowd of love for this movie. I predict in the future it will reach the mid to high 6/10 territory. Don't let the Sandler haters crowd your judgement. This is meant to be seen on the big screen. Don't take it too seriously. Go take your kids or see it with friends. Especially if you were a kid during the 80s or know other people who were around during that time. This will be a huge blast of fun nostalgia for you and others if so. But even if you don't recognize all the throwbacks in this movie, you will still have a good time! This was probably the best Adam Sandler comedy since Anger Management. But I dare say it's his best and most fun movie altogether. I would love to see a sequel!","10/10"

"Pixels","TheLittleSongbird","3 June 2018","Watched 'Pixels' a few days ago with not very high expectations. Am not a fan of Adam Sandler, although he has done good performances in the past or the juvenile humour that permeates in too many of his comedies, and the advertising and negative reviews made me further nervous. Absolutely loved the concept though and have a lot of love for Peter Dinklage ('Game of Thrones' is a favourite and he is one of the main reasons).It also garnered a lot of vehement defence so condescending that it put me off watching it for a long time until it came on Film4 and decided to watch it finally. After watching it, 'Pixels' for me was not a particularly good film and didn't do enough with such a great concept, but it could have been so much worse. It is not that bad and is a long way from being one of Sandler's worst (nothing is worse than 'Grown Ups 2' and especially 'Jack and Jill').Starting with the good things, 'Pixels' looks great. Especially in the imaginative production design and truly impressive special effects. There are amusing moments (almost all of it from Dinklage and occasionally from Josh Gad), some decent action and an element of nostalgia.The soundtrack is suitably energetic. Other than the visuals, the best thing about it is Dinklage, for Dinklage it is far from one of his best performances but he does show a knack for comic timing.However, Sandler is on lifeless autopilot throughout and his comic timing is irritating and tired. Gad tries hard but too often over-compensates that he is more annoying than funny and Kevin James is just bizarre in his role. The rest of the cast are wasted and the direction lacks energy and ease.More annoying was that 'Pixels' had such an inventive concept and managed to make it so bland and predictable. There are no surprises here, no originality or imagination, the fun and energy only comes sporadically and tonally the film feels muddled. The references may make older viewers nostalgic but most of them don't serve much purpose and are likely to be lost on younger viewers unfamiliar with what is being referenced. Further killing 'Pixels' is the writing and humour. There are moments that do raise a mild chuckle or smirk but a vast majority of it induces groans and cringing, because the dialogue is so childish and forced and the humour is incredibly juvenile in a way that has been tired and grating long before 'Pixels' was made and came out. It's been present in a lot of Sandler's films especially the ones released in the last decade or so and there is a lot of deja vu here.In summary, not that bad and has its moments but wastes a great concept and is just too juvenile, bland and bizarre to get much from it. 4/10 Bethany Cox","7/10"

Did Adam Sandler steal their lollypop or something? I mean the movie is not the greatest film of all time but it was light and fun and had almost no negatives. Why such hatred. I don't get it, but remember that critics like these said that Star Wars would flop and the ET wouldn't make a dime. Someone brought up Siskel and Ebert and I laugh because they hated both ET and Star Wars. Ignore the critics who hate everything and have no fun in life.

"Pixels","wjets9","23 July 2015","When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked absolutely amazing... then Adam Sandler showed up. This immediately tempered my expectations for this film, but it had a fantastic plot, and enough actors/actresses that I still was pretty excited for it. What I watched absolutely blew me away.The basic premise of the movie is this: an attempted communication with aliens is taken as a threat of war, and so they attack earth using the very games they were sent footage of. In order to defeat them and save earth, a group of people who were video game champions as kids are called upon to save the planet.As previously mentioned, I loved some of the acting choices for this movie. Ashley Benson is a personal favorite, and despite only having very limited screen time, and not actually saying a single word, she delivers a very strong performance as Lady Lisa. Peter Dinklage is most known for his role on Game of Thrones, but I personally know him from the horror comedy Knights of Badassdom. Previously I knew him as a vulgar, ""out there"" comedy actor, but in this film he manages to tone it down enough to make it a (mostly) family friendly performance, while still maintaining the edge that I love about him. This was actually my first time seeing Michelle Monaghan, and I didn't know Josh Gad too well, but both of them (in particular Gad) had more than noteworthy performances.Now finally for the biggest question mark of the film, Sandler. As the title I put to the review indicates, I believe this has the potential to be a career saving movie for him. I have previously only truly enjoyed him 3 times, the latest being The Longest Yard, and before that in Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. More recently I have wasted money going to the theatres to see his films, and even seeing what I consider to be the 2 worst movies I've ever seen in theatre in Funny People, and Jack and Jill. But he delivers a great performance here, and has made a step in earning my trust back in movies.Overall, I'm not trying to say the film is without flaw, but then again not many films are. This is a very fun movie, and will keep you entertained the entire time. I give this movie a 10/10.","9/10"

I am not sure if people who did not grow up in the 80's will get it either, possibly? There were a lot of pop-culture references from that era and that made it all the more funny. The cameo's were great and the actors chose to play in the movie were great and great together. I love Adam Sandler, and Peter Dinklage was by far the funniest character in the whole movie.

On a traditional (and reassuring) narrative pattern Authors built a film which is, under many aspects, innovative.The idea is funny (credits should be given to French artist Patrick Jean and his 2012 short 'Pixels' for inspiration and further graphic development). The moral message is relaxing (being awkward doesn't mean that you can't be President of the United States, at least as long as you'll stay close to your loser friends). And the visual impact is great.Chris Columbus has the gift of creating entertaining and amazing images (remember the Gryffindor's Quidditch from the first Harry Potter?) and if you'll turn your brain off you'll be nicely amused: it's a kids movie.","7/10"

When a US military base is attacked, the President of the United States calls his old gamer buddy Brenner(who was at the competition in 1982) to confirm his suspicions that characters from Galaga destroyed the base. Soon enough, the 1982 champions are back together defending the Earth against the alien threat.Pixels is not Wreck it Ralph, but who wanted it to be? Instead it is a bunch of crazy alien invasion fun with a heavy helping of 1980's nostalgia. Peter Dinklage is surprisingly funny as a comic foil, and the rest of the cast are good in their roles. Good but not great direction from Chris Columbus and a funny script. As for the 3D, while it had proper depth, it didn't add too much, but the alien scenes(which account for about a third of the film) did benefit from it.Despite the fact the Adam Sandler is in this, it's one of Mr. Sandler's better films of late. Not one of the best comedies of 2015, but very far from the worst. Pixels is an entertaining silly comedy, and worth your time.","9/10"
"Pixels","eddie_baggins","25 April 2016","Spoken about regularly as one of 2015's worst films, Pixels is a dire comedy made by and starring a bunch of people that should know better and a film that thinks some good old fashioned gaming nostalgia will be enough to win us over despite the fact this 'comedy' is scarily bereft of laughs, charm and features a cast that looks like they would rather be somewhere else, spending the money they earnt here on a not well earned break.I can't recall from recent memory a film that feels so tired, so bored with itself, almost resigned to the fact that it's not fun and it doesn't help at all that in a recent career full of bad roles and lethargic performances, Pixels features Adam Sandler at his very worst.The Oxford dictionary better update their recent editions as tired and uninterested needs to place a picture of Sandler under those definitions.Sandler's avid old school arcade gamer Sam Brenner is truly one of the worst leading characters of modern film. Possessing neither a comedic timing, an ounce of actual effort or any genuine hint of life, Sandler is but a zombie walking through this ugly looking cavalcade of ideas and uninteresting action scenes, scenes that are reminisce of someone playing a fun game but never sharing the controller as you sit back and watch. Sandler's career has once and for all slumped to a new low personnel low and the same can be said of director Chris Columbus.The man responsible for the first two Harry Potter films, Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone and also the writer of Gremlins and The Goonies, it's clear Columbus knows a thing or two about entertaining people through the medium of film but Pixels seems devoid of entertainment and Columbus must be blamed for so blandly directing this wannabe franchise starter. Wasting not only the chance to merge gaming lore with big screen thrills but support from the likes of an unbelievably bad Peter Dinklage (Tyrion would be sorely disappointed) and the sad supporting turns from actors like Sean Bean and Brian Cox.Any movie that casts Kevin James as the American President was going to have a hard time succeeding but really there is no excuse for Pixels to be so downright boring and lacking in joy. Getting a star purely around the fact it has some nice ideas that never eventuate into their potential, Pixels is such a sad state of affairs that many of its cast members will be wishing they had another life to spend on not signing up for this disaster in the first place. As for the idea of this becoming a franchise, game over man.game over.1 episode of One Tree Hill out of 5","7/10"

Seeing Lady Lisa come to life had to be the dream of many watching this story unfold. Good for Ludlow! And Eddie getting the phone call at the award presentation also great fun.

"Pixels","ecatalan98","30 August 2015","Naysayer's beware: If you don't like Adam Sandler and/or 80's cultural references, you are NOT going to like PIXELS. Is this movie masterpiece theater? Far from it. Will it win best picture at the Academy Awards? Highly unlikely. Will it enthrall 40 year olds who grew up with arcade games? Chances are, most will. I just stepped out of the theater and I must confess I enjoyed PIXELS very, very much, despite reading the god awful reviews by ""film critics"" as well as pimp faced IMDb readers. I agree that Adam Sandler's fortunes at the box office have been on a down slide for some years now but then again, he was never that ""big"" of a draw, like say, Eddie Murphy in his prime. I guess if you try to over analyze any of Sandler's films you're going to wind up seriously depressed. PIXELS is big, dumb fun, full of 80's references (the arcade games, the music, hell, even MTV!). I won't describe the movie because other users have done eloquently so. I'll just stick with my very positive praises for this movie. My daughters, who have nothing to do with 80's culture, both enjoyed the movie a whole lot. True, my kids know most of the games that appear in the movie and see them come to life and interact with real characters was a roller-coaster ride. There's Pacman, Defender, Frogger, Q- Bert, Galaga, Asteroids, Space Invaders and of course, Donkey Kong. Certainly the over 40 crowd out there will enjoy it, but young kids will too.Plus, as a GAME OF THRONES fan, it was a rush seeing Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage in here, and having CHEAP TRICK kicking off the movie is always good in my book!I'm buying this on bluray as soon as it comes out!","10/10"

Although it's true that some of the jokes fell flat that can be said of many, many films, so I won't hold that against it. I enjoyed it, and would watch it again so please don't believe all the anti-hype and go see it for yourself. Personally, I like and own several A.S. films.

Is it because Adam Sandler is in it, and people expect it to be bad? Is it too unrealistic? What's the stupid reason for the low rating?The idea is pretty original. The effects are pretty much top notch. The acting is satisfactory. The humor is alright, nothing too advanced though.Pixels is actually of a pretty rare breed. It is a high budget, comedy/action/sci-fi disaster-movie. Maybe that's why people don't like it, it doesn't fit comfortably in one genre.Anyhow, I enjoyed it. It's not quite great, but good. I got a little bit of that late 90's - early 2000's feeling, which I love. The effects look really good. It has a couple of quite exciting scenes. I didn't find it super funny, but it has a light, nice atmosphere. The acting is pretty much like expected, but Kevin James stands out, and does a great job.It doesn't have a lot of tension, but it being a feel good disaster movie, it doesn't matter much.Don't take it so damn seriously, just let yourself be entertained, and you'll probably like it.","8/10"

However, the aliens misinterpret enclosed video-feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war. They attack the Earth using the games as models for their various assaults including Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Space Invaders, Arkanoid and Tetris. Their technology creates voxels that change form and are capable of turning any form of matter into more of itself. President Will Cooper (Kevin James) calls upon his best friend since childhood, former video game professional Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), who is now a home theater installer and had a previous relationship with Cooper's wife (Jane Krakowski). To combat the video game characters, Brenner decides to lead a team of retrogamers Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) to defeat the aliens with technology similar to those used in games.Pixels is a great 2015 American science fiction comedy film all people must see.

"Pixels","BA_Harrison","2 July 2017","Let me start by saying that I'm not averse to Adam Sandler—I've enjoyed quite a few of his films—and I admire Chris Columbus if only for writing Gremlins. Pixels, however, is dreadful, and fully deserving of any critical mauling it has received.A promising premise—aliens attack Earth in the form of video games after mistaking a videotape of '80s arcade classics for a declaration of war—is developed as a series of lacklustre action scenes loaded with flashy CGI and not very funny humour.Sandler adopts his usual affable loser persona but can do little with the lousy material; also wasted are the talents of Brian Cox, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, while the lovely Ashley Benson, as sexy game character Lady Lisa, is there purely as eye candy (not that I'm complaining about that—she was sorely needed to take my mind off the terrible comedy).It's also hard to see who the film would appeal to: adults will find much of the humour childish and grating (the 'cute' digital Q-bert character had me cringing in embarrassment), while the many references to '80s pop culture (Max Headroom, Hall and Oates, most of the games) will be lost on the young.And is it even possible to use a cheat code on an arcade machine? I think not.","7/10"

It's different from most Adam Sandler movies as it have heavy CGI but still had some solid laughs. It had some real good 1980s moments as the aliens not only used arcade games but when sending messages had clips of various 80s icons providing their message which added some funny moments. Like most Adam Sandler movies there was some interesting casting. I loved seeing Brian Cox and Sean Bean in a few scenes together bringing back memories of ""Sharpe's Eagle"". There was also a nice cameo from Serena Williams. The CGI was great and it was pretty original, not a rehash of the aliens blowing things up. I will definitely see it again.","9/10"

It certainly has its flaws, my biggest issue is that the trailer spoiled too much of the movie, it shows every single battle (that being three) as well as basically every video game character that appears in this, it should have had much more, it was clearly given creative freedom by Sony to use as many as they could and I don't think they took advantage of that as much as they should have, there should have been more characters other than Q*bert to be used for cute comic relief, and I think there should have been a few more battles between the humans and the classic games as well. This film is receiving way too much criticism that I don't think it deserves, it isn't perfect and it dosen't make as much use of its creative and original plot as it could have, but the reviews for this are brutal and I don't understand why, I think critics just assume that an Adam Sandler film is always going to be terrible, and when that's your attitude and you're going in to all his films with extremely low expectations, then of course you won't like it, critics don't seem to look at Pixels for the fun and harmless adventure it is, and I actually found Sandler to be quite charming in it, the kind of comedic performance I like from him, subtle and realistic, and because of these reviews Pixels became the most underrated movie of the summer. Though it certainly has its imperfections, Piixels is a very fun movie that had me entertained and sucked in to this world of pure imagination from start to finish, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film that children and adults will enjoy. A group of hardcore gamers must battle aliens who have come to attack Earth in the form of classic 80's video game characters. Best Performance: Josh Gad Worst Performance: Brian Cox","8/10"
"Pixels","valen060","24 July 2015","Among the many scathing reviews critics have written regarding Adam Sandler films over the years, I'd say it's best to ignore them for once as this movie one-ups the dullness left behind by recent duds Grown Ups 2 and Mall Cop 2 combined. Speaking of the latter, seeing Paul Blart become President felt more like a barrel of laughs that I could never take my mind off of. Back to my review, the film starring Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan was certainly impressive with its visuals though with a story that looked too simple to write. Director Chris Columbus himself has had a string of hits (Home Alone, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) and misses (Rent), but I'd say this one in particular has some significance and is more like a teeter-totter between thrills and monotony.Adam Sandler portrays washed-up 80s avid gamer Sam Brenner who now works as a software installer, but when he's summoned by his old friend-turned-President Will Cooper, he and fellow former 80s gamers must ally together to stop an alien threat taking on the form of familiar video game characters or it's GAME OVER for all.Usually these days, I avoid Sandler-starring/produced films in movie theaters and wait for its DVD release (my last one seeing in theaters was 2008's Don't Mess with the Zohan), but when I first heard of him being thrown into a battle against classic 80s video game characters, they already had me at ""video games."" After witnessing Wreck-It Ralph back in 2012, I was entranced and drooling in 80s/90s arcade nostalgia. Those same elements were used again for an Adam Sandler comedy, so I rushed immediately to the theater to see if it can actually work. In the end, it had a few misogynistic moments, predictable outcomes, interesting celeb cameos, and typical dysfunctional humor used in many Happy Madison Production films. But when you throw in Olaf and Tyrion Lannister into the mix, its brand of humor now feels very much like Wreck-It Ralph crossed with Ghostbusters. One scene, for example, that was pretty clever was luring Pac-Man into chasing the lead guys in their appropriately color-coded vehicles, thus making the city look like a giant maze for him to roam around like in his original arcade game. Though the characters may not have had the best one-liners in some scenes or lacking true chemistry, it's a visual joyride for new, young generation gamers. Whereas old-school gamers of the 80s-90s will appreciate the nods and tributes, but will notice the lack in depth to see it as a good movie. Nevertheless, I liked seeing these four main guys (armed with proton pack-like weapons) getting themselves caught in harsh predicaments when lives are on the line, albeit with humorous results. Shouldn't be overlooked for a summer flick. Try a few quarters and there might be something good out of this. Game on!","3/10"
"Pixels","georgecoffeynewyorker","16 August 2015","Well what a movie it turned out to be. Kevin James who plays the President, provided a fantastic score. He brought along his King of Queens humor and laughter. I was literally breaking my sides laughing on a constant basis. It was activating my soar throat. Thats how funny it was.It basically tells a story of the classic video games that the Aliens mistaken to be destroying their planet. Adam Sandler who played Brenner, wasn't too bad. I'm not a fan of the actor. But in this case I found him to be at home. The film starts off with a group of young kids playing video games in the arcade. It is then announced at a convention that NASA is to send a Time capsule sorting a thing to Space. However the Aliens misinterpret and start attacking Earth with all they've got. They come in the shape Donkey Kong, Pac - Man etc., All the oldies. All the crew get together to save the world.","10/10"
"Pixels","coastdaze","27 July 2015","I liked this movie...I think mostly because I was gaming during this time. I fondly remembered all these computer characters and laughed at seeing them so huge. I wondered what the kids who did not experience the games of the 80's thought? Don't know if they get it. But oh well, I did and enjoyed it thoroughly.Loved seeing Peter D. (Game of Thrones little guy). He is crazy and cute in this character. Adam Sandler does well because of those around him. :-)All in all, I liked it and suggest you see it esp. if you remember gaming in the 80's! And remember, it's for fun.","1/10"
"Pixels","anaconda-40658","8 August 2015","Pixels (2015): Dir: Chris Columbia / Cast: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage: Nostalgia flushed down the toilet with this passionless reflection on classic video games. Apparently Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, etc are taking over earth and the military is automatically deemed useless. Only a group of childhood friends now adults can stop this mess because they apparently know the methods of the game. Chris Columbus has been a director of entertaining films whether it be within the Harry Potter films or his work with Robin Williams. Here the game is over before it starts for Columbus. Kevin James as the United States President is a comedic accident all its own. He apparently cannot read and becomes the public laughing stalk. There can be a grain of truth to this when it comes to reading scripts this bad. Adam Sandler leads the group as a sort of repairman because he was great at the arcades as a youngster. Michelle Monaghan plays a mother who is working for the president. Her first impressions of Sandler involves her spilling her guts about her cheating husband. This becomes predictable opposites attract situation that grows stale quickly. Josh Gad plays the grown version of the classic nerd kid. The one sound performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Sandler's childhood competition turned criminal as an adult. He finds redemption but unfortunately that doesn't save the horrid special effects. There was so much potential given the premise but the screenplay is lazy with actors whose game is getting closer to ending when they are unable to counter the bad arcade visions. Score: 3 ½ / 10","10/10"
"Pixels","attorneychriscarr","13 August 2015","I think some people are expecting WAY too much out of this movie. It's a kids movie which has a lot of appeal for adults. It's one of the more appealing kids movies I've seen in years. It's definitely geared more towards the 8-12 crowd, rather than younger kids' movies (like Despicable Me, which is also great). The language is a bit course at points, but nothing too bad.I read all these horrible reviews and was not looking forward to it, but it was SO entertaining! I was worried that it would be another crappy Adam Sandler movie (I like him, but he has definitely had some real bombs). But he did NOT try to hijack the entire movie like some people suggest. He shared the screen well with the other actors.Sure, Kevin James was a strange choice as president but, again, IT'S A KIDS MOVIE! While some adults can't handle the package delivery guy from King of Queens being president, most of the target audience probably doesn't even know who he is. And he is NOT playing some bumbling doofus like in Mall Cop. He successfully pulls off the role of a president who is stuck in a video game and I cannot imagine anyone else doing a better job.All in all, the movie was very entertaining (better the the Minions movie I took the kids too last month--snore...). How do you NOT enjoy seeing Pacman gobbling up cars and people like dots on the streets of New York City. Each game was parodied just the right amount. I wouldn't have wanted 90 minutes of any one video game, but I think they are successful in giving you just enough of each video game ""battle"" to keep in interesting and not boring. It's exciting enough for kids that aren't familiar with the old- school games, but gives some nostalgia (and some subtle grown-up humor) to keep the adults entertained.Sure, no one is going to win an Academy Award for this film, but it is funny, entertaining and an enjoyable way to spend an hour and 45 minutes.","6/10"
"Pixels","dukeakasmudge","2 March 2016","When I 1st heard about Pixels, I was pumped & couldn't wait to see it.Now after finally watching it, Major, MAJOR disappointment.After seeing Kevin James was the president (Seriously?) the movie just went straight downhill from there.I just felt like as it went along, it just got more & more & more boring.The only good thing about Pixels was seeing all the old video game characters, remembering the old video games I use to play & the 1's I didn't recognize, trying to figure out what games they were from.God, this movie stunk.I can't think of enough bad things to say about it.If somebody told me to come up with 1 funny moment from the movie, I'd say the scene where the lady is in her closet, crying over husband, drinking wine from a sippy cup & Adam Sandler walks in.Other than that, nothing.If you're thinking of watching Pixels, I'd tell you to skip this movie & find something better to do with your time","6/10"
"Pixels","SagiY21","15 August 2015","* MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS (and peanuts) * It had the basic concept we all know of the aliens trying to invade earth in-order to decimate it, and human kind has to come together and rise up to defeat the bad guys.As technology evolves (in our world) - it is a nostalgic feast for the eyes to see all the games you used to love come to life (1987 here). If you didn't realize it by now, LIFE - is - a video game. You play the role of your persona, and set out to conquer the world.All in all, for avid people of nostalgic games (and newbies), get your glasses (3D) on and enter the fun world of games.","1/10"
"Pixels","jmoneyjohal","24 July 2015","Now when one walks into a Adam Sandler movie if your are excepting a comedy classic especially after seeing his last couple of films, then you are done right crazy. Pixels however isn't as bad as his last couple, but its far from his best work.Pixels when it comes to story, or screenplay its down right absurd.The film is full of loopholes at every corner. Please throw your sensibilities out of the window when watching the film. For example Kevin James is playing the president of America, if you feel my drift.While the script did need some work on, Pixels at the end of the day is still pretty enjoyable. Its full of good comedy, the VFX is great, and if you grew up in the 90s or 80s seeing characters of Donkey Kong, Pacman on screen bring back sweet some nostalgia.Story wise the film is pretty much about 3 nerd gamers saving the world from alien invaders, who are sending video game characters to destroy the world..... Yeah like i mentioned earlier the story is ABSURD.Acting wise Adam Sandler, Kevin James,Peter Dinklage, and Josh Gad act well in there comic avatar.Overall this is the perfect leave your brains at home and just enjoy type of film. If your looking even for a outa of sensibilities in this film don't watch it!!! If you don't like video games, do not watch also. For the rest enjoy.Dir Chris Columbus has had better films but this one is definitely not as bad as some critic made it out to be.3/5* or 6/10","7/10"
"Pixels","LloydBayer","22 July 2015","Nostalgia is a powerful emotion but also the only word that can entirely describe Pixels - a sci-fi adventure masquerading as a comedy. While this film has every reason to fail as a comedy, it can still appeal to a specific audience - kids of the 80s, and the current generation of pre-teens yet to discover the trappings of social media.That's a generation gap of 30 years, but the defining moment that bridges this gap is the mutual love for video games. Back in the day, the social norm was to get out of the house, walk to the arcade, spend a few hours with real friends, and vie for social standing as a champion gamer. It felt real with moments that bring back joyous memories that not even a thousand friends on Facebook can match today. On the flip side, gamers are still typecast as nerds, and this is what the film attempts to say. It's 1982 and gaming prodigy Sam has a shot at the Guinness Book championship title. Backed by his gaming chums Will and Ludlow, Sam reaches the finals in a faceoff against narcissist nemesis Eddie 'The Fire Blaster'. Also present is NASA who records the competition and sends it into space to contact alien life. Wrong move. Cut to present day and Will (Kevin James) is the President of the USA (there's hope for gamers?) while Sam (Adam Sandler) and Ludlow (Josh Gad) are everyday losers. Turns out, those aliens did get the message but misinterpreted it as a hostile invitation. Who do you call? Ghostbusters zapping aliens pretty much sums up the rest of the film. While the story gets dumber by the minute (inclusive of the clichéd romance between Sandler's Mr. Fixit and Michelle Monaghan's White House official), director Chris Columbus alternates flat gags with solid visuals and iconic characters that wreak havoc on screen. Add to that some madcap moments from Peter Dinklage as the aforementioned narcissist, Gad let loose ala Jonah Hill style from the Jump Street films, and a list of clever cameos, and there's enough reason for Pixels to generate some offbeat excitement.The fact that Sandler is still pigeonholed as a sad-sack from his Happy Madison Productions (from Happy Gilmore to last year's The Cobbler) can be a typical letdown for many viewers and fans alike. It's the same reason why most of the amusement comes from the supporting cast. Even as they deliver with acceptable comic timing, the real fun is in racing back to the days of Atari or annihilating monsters at the gaming arcade. And speaking of nostalgia, look no further than Columbus, the writing genius behind all time classics like The Goonies and Gremlins - films that are as iconic as the Pac-Man and Donkey Kong games. Kids who watched those films or played those games are grownups today but for the most part, Pixels made me feel as invincible as a kid in an arcade. Game on dude!","8/10"
"Pixels","davexist","22 July 2015","Possibly 1 of the worst all-time movies ever made. I know it's mainly aimed at the pre-teen group, but still... characters have no identity, jokes - if you can call them that - fall flat, over-acting is put in place of anything remotely funny. Also, the editing seems like it was done by 4 different people on 4 different substances. Scenes start and end abruptly, there's never a flow to anything. Just absolutely dreadful. I feel my IQ was just halved. This will undoubtedly be shown in film school one day as ""how NOT to make a movie."" Kudos all around for contributing to the dumbing down of a nation. Save the children, take them to the park instead of this.","8/10"

But ignore all the critics and the hate that goes along with them, and go see one of the funnest films of the summer. The acting isn't great, its a Sandler film, you shouldn't be expecting it to be.

Look at yourselves, if you didn't enjoy yourself at this movie, you probably are taking life or yourselves too seriously. The ratings are low because people enjoy arty farty movies too much?

"Pixels","supermaggie","28 May 2016","The film starts well with a fun look back to the 80s, and then immediately makes its first mistake. Hollywood never learns, using a cookie-cutter approach by implementing a coerced, annoying, unnecessary, implausible love story between Sandler and Monaghan, and later (Spoiler alert) an even more ridiculous one with ""Ludlow"" and ""Lady Lisa"", who (unfortunately even at the expense of QBert) miraculously falls in love with him and therefore opposes her makers ... downright laughable, unnecessary, coarse, boring, this is a movie about old video games, no romantic comedy!!!!!! The generous four points are merely for the battle against Centipede, the one against Pacman and for casting Sean Bean and Ashley Benson (albeit her unworthy role). In short, the film could have been great, if the makers had been concentrating on the core story, but when Sandler and James notwithstanding the premise do their usual BS, the bottom line is only disappointment.","10/10"

Sure, it was silly, but it is a comedy, not an Oscar-winning drama. The visual effects were very intriguing, something I had not seen before in a movie. I think all of the actors gave fantastic performances, yes, even Adam Sandler, and the full theater I was in was laughing constantly. Most importantly, I left the theater feeling better than I did going in there. I left this movie with a warm feeling, and a smile that would not leave my face. This film is heartwarming fun for the whole family, and plenty of nostalgia for fans of the 80s. Don't listen to the critics! Go see this movie and form your own opinion!

"Pixels","keal","22 October 2015","As a kid I was one of the gamers who made the local news. I got to the end of Pac-Man. I could play forever on Robotron: 2084. To this day I have MAME always loaded on a PC and I go through the old games. I do love Skyrim and Super Hexagon, so as a gamer, I'm complete. I read all the bad reviews on Pixels, but I just had to see it for myself. I was pleasantly surprised.I never cared for Adam Sandler's other films, having only sit through Happy Gilmore. I couldn't stomach much else of his. But maybe he gets better as he ages, or I get more tolerant as I do. Either way, I couldn't find a single bad thing about this film. If you're an old school gamer, this movie is a great treat.The footage of the old arcade games in the beginning - the games didn't have video screen artifacts. Basically, they weren't pixellated as they were supposed to be. I forgave that. I mean, who cares, really? That's about the only inconsistency I could find, and it was trivial.The film was entertaining from beginning to end. Especially nice was during the end credits. They replay the entire movie in 8-bit format. It was easy to see that Pixels was a labor of love, and I guess you have to be an old school gamer to appreciate it all. This is a classic, and I'm happy to be alive to have gotten to see this. I can imagine what it's like to be Stan Lee, and see all your superhero creations come to life as some of the most successful films of all time. To see the 80's arcade culture brought to life and memorialized in Pixels, it's a similar feeling, one that all gamers can share.I highly recommend this film. I give it a perfect score. Well deserved.","2/10"

The script was terrible, the women characters are just there to stand and look pretty, Sandler was unfunny and looked like he just wanted a paycheck, everyone else seemed to be phoning it in, but Peter Dinklage was the only person who was funny the whole time and even that isn't saying much, as he only made me laugh twice. Kids might enjoy this movie, but kids will enjoy anything.Pixels had a great idea, but the dialogue was not good at all, the acting was awful, and the characters had zero chemistry.

'Pixels' Synopsis: When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of the video games.'Pixels' has some moments, that work on its advantage. The concept firstly is fun & watching the legendary characters of the arcade games come to life, give us fan boys, pure guilty pleasure. However, the goings-on aren't always engaging & the pace drops in the middle too. But, 'Pixels' needs to be watched with limited expectations, in order, to enjoy it!Tim Herlihy & Timothy Dowling's Adapted Screenplay is mostly fun, but it could've been tighter. The second-hour, especially, lacks meat. Chris Columbus's Direction is passable. Graphics are pretty good. Cinematography & Editing are okay. Art Design is accurate. Performance-Wise: Adam Sandler is as usual. Kevin James is superb as the goofy president. Michelle Monaghan is adequate. Josh Gad & The Terrific Peter Dinklage are funny. Brian Cox is wasted.

But in the end, this is an Adam Sandler vehicle, and all of this is tailored to his indifferent personality. I have no problem with him; he can be a great actor. When he wants to be.

The bottom line is it was comical and entertaining. The idea though ridiculous, was at least fresh to all the movies being produced today appearing to be recycled from other movies. It kind of reminds me of the original Hot Tub Machine movie that was unexpectedly a fresh idea and was entertaining. Like that movie , there were parts of this movie that were just plain funny and amusing. The movie theater I was in most people laughed multiple times, I can not remember another movie (recently) where the majority of the moviegoers were noticeably laughing.

"Pixels","cosmo_tiger","27 October 2015","""We're the only ones who can do this! I'm kidding, we're all gonna die."" Sam Brenner (Sandler) is one of the greatest video gamers in 1982. After making the finals in the championships he is devastated when he comes in second. For prosperity purposes the video tape of the contest is shot into space. 33 years later he is working as an electronics installer when he gets a call from his childhood friend, President Cooper (James) telling him that the Earth is under attack...by video games. Now it is up to Sam along with other gamers from 1982 to save the world. This is a movie I was not sure what to expect. To me, Sandler is either very funny (Happy Gilmore) or unwatchable (Jack & Jill), and I thought this one could go either way. I was actually leaning toward the latter but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised and I laughed a lot throughout. The movie is really nothing amazing but what it is is very entertaining and a decent family movie. Growing up in the 80's I loved seeing all the old video game characters again and I have to admit that Q-Bert stole the movie. This is a very Sandler type movie and is not worth all the bad press it was getting. Overall, much much better than I was expecting and I surprisingly enjoyed this as did my family. I surprisingly give this a B+.","9/10"
"Pixels","maximovlE","2 July 2019","This movie is exactly what it should be. Early 80s low resolution games attacking earth. So what do you expect? Adam Sandler being ridiculous, Peter dinklage not being Tyrion, Sean Bean being ridiculously British (shame he didn't get a scene with Peter)...Heroes, villans, stupidity, a touch of romance, a loveable kid... Easy movie to sit back to, relax, and stop taking everything so serious.Perfect.","10/10"
"Pixels","framptonhollis","23 August 2015","This is the 2nd worst film I've seen from 2015 so far. the first being ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"",both Happy Madison Productions. Oh boy.Adam Sandler is certainly no Clark Gable when it comes to being a leading man. He is just a tired 48 year old man, he's better off playing a single father in his late 40s. That's what he looks like. HE DOESN""T LOOK LIKE HE'S GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah, and Kevin James is the president. Yup. That is ""Pixels"" for you. A WASTE OF MY TIME!!!!!!!!!!The film is disturbingly clichéd. Oh is it clichéd. How is it that Adam Sandler gets Michelle Monaghan's character as his lover! That just doesn't make sense! Of course, in the beginning, they hate each other, but you know what happens. You know. It is so predictable, but that's what you're going to get.The first 3 minutes were kind of cool. But that's because I liked the song. That Cheap Trick song was the best part of the whole movie. The WHOLE MOVIE! But, hey, there were a few positive things about the movie. The first 20 minutes had a few brief funny moments, and the special effects were pretty neat. The concept and action sequences were pretty clever, but the battle scenes, overall, become boring. That's the thing about these modern big-budget movies, the action sequences just become boring after a while. They also try to fill these action sequences with ""jokes"". Of course, jokes has to be in quotes, because these ""jokes"" are basically Josh Gad falling down and yelling.Overall, this movie is an embarrassment, but Adam Sandler doesn't care, he just wants your money.","2/10"
"Pixels","milos-kstc","16 August 2015","Really guys, for the whole movie I've just waited and waited for the awful part but it really never came. Yeah, it's a bit geek-ish but for all of us born in the era of Commodore it is a great reminder of time when games were a lot simpler but we enjoyed them on a much more basic level. If you think about it, those games didn't really have a story but were insanely fun and addictive. It's like basketball V Halo, both are games but..you know what I mean. Anyway, soundtrack was great, fun parts were not hilarious but did bring smile to my face at moments, acting was fine for the most part, pace also...in a nutshell: I had great fun watching this and that's all you really need to know about it. Forget the ratings and critics. Go watch this and you won't regret it..at least not if you were born in the 80's.","3/10"

You can take what I wrote and spin it of course (like I would do with one guy who wrote he doesn't understand the overall vote this has - yeah me too! Because anything above 5 is ridiculous), but you cannot take anything in the movie and spin it.The best thing in this is Peter Dinklage. And even he has to suffer through a lot of scenes that are just dreadful And not in a good sense either. Unless you're watching this as ""50 Shades of Pac-Man"" I suggest to stay as far away from it as possible. Maybe kids, who don't get the misogynistic and unfunny tone of the movie, might like some of it, but how they were able to turn a more than decent idea into a pile of ... well you know what - I can't really understand or fathom. I almost felt dirty (again not in a good way, just disgusting) after watching this, it's hard to express it with any other words.Predictable, unfunny (throwing insults into peoples faces, being racist or generally discriminating can be funny - if you're able to pull that off - obviously not the case here, unless intoxicated) and just generally bad, making good actors looking weak (Michelle, Peter Dinklage) is quite a feat ... not one I actually enjoy watching though","5/10"

I usually start my reviews with the positives. Okay. The visuals looked crisp and virtual like the old arcade games. That's a major plus this movie has going for it. It also has some moderately funny performances from Gad and Dinklage. Done! Now this is the worst movie of the year. I don't like to give out F's it seems too harsh. This movie doesn't get one. I don't like to write reviews on movie that I didn't enjoy very much. This is the exception. I refused to write a review on Hot Pursuit and Soaked in Bleach because I didn't hate those movies. I hate this one!This movie has nothing funny or interesting to say. It spews out so much garbage that it's almost painful to watch. Adam Sandler kills. What? The role? NO! The movie. His performance is as wooden as Woody from Toy Story(great movie, I am in no way comparing the two) and much more bland. Kevin James' comedy is dry and stale. He's basically the clumsy guy who breaks a ton of stuff. Who thought that that would be entertaining or funny? The direction is fine but could've been better. I didn't expect much from the men that wrote This Means War and Grown Ups 2, at least they didn't disappoint.Overall this movie was bad and borderline unwatchable. If you want to see a movie this week watch Southpaw or Paper Towns, not this. Pixels gets a 3/10 or a D+ just because of Dinklage and Gad's performances and the visuals. Nothing else.","7/10"
"Pixels","Steviereno","11 October 2015","In perusing the reviews for this movie, the usual Adam Sandler haters seem to be out in force, demanding that he give them their full measure of character development.Well, in a word, they are wrong.The other big word in the reviews seems to be something called ""FUN"".This is a fun movie, with no pretenses and no pomposity, just a basic plot - our heroes save the world in THEIR way, and the hero gets the girl. Adam Sandler plays his usual humble character who starts out as a loser and ends up with impressing the girl and doing the seeming impossible. He came up with a novel scenario and meets the fun needs of the viewers. At least the ones who didn't start out the movie intending to hate it.MY OWN TAKE ON IT was that it was an update of Ghostbusters, and even included ghosts of a sort (PACMAN ghosts) in the process. It was pretty much Bill Murray and company battling surreal enemies, engaging in witty repartee with the heroine, and using similar pasted-together high-tech devices to battle the enemy with. I was half expecting ""Don't cross the streams!"" somewhere along the line. Or ""...Cats and dogs living together"".I thought it was a nice romp.I DO wonder if anyone panned Ghostbusters as much when it came out.","8/10"
"Pixels","SnoopyStyle","29 February 2016","Sam Brenner and his chubby loser friend Will Cooper go to the 1982 Worldwide Video Arcade Championships. Ludlow Lamonsoff is a weird nerd with his grandmother. Sam loses to Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant in the final game. A tape of the event is sent into space as a message to aliens. In the present day, Cooper (Kevin James) is the ridiculed President of United States. Brenner (Adam Sandler) is still his best friend but he's in a dead-end job. He falls for Violet (Michelle Monaghan) who turns out to be a Lieutenant Colonel in weapons development. Aliens mistake the tape as a challenge and send light-based weapons in the form of the arcade game characters. Ludlow (Josh Gad) has turned into a conspiracy theorist and Eddie (Peter Dinklage) is in prison. The group has to use their gaming skills to defend the planet in a death match.There is a lot of hate for Adam Sandler. This is not that horrible but he wasted a great opportunity. I love this concept. The movie works great during the battle scenes. It's fun action with loads of 80s recalls. When the action stops, the movie gets really rocky. Sandler continues to have trouble being likable. He keeps playing an annoying douche although he's not as bad as some of his recent outings. He has lost his boyish fun charms of his early movies. His romance with Monaghan has its ups and downs. Kevin James starts out well with a bunch of girl scouts making fun of him. The problem is that he takes his cue from Sandler and overdoes it. Josh Gad needs to dial back the creepiness one level. Being obsessed with a pixel character is creepy although making her Ashley Benson helps a lot. Peter Dinklage is pushing too hard. In general, Chris Columbus has every character pushing too hard. They don't need to and it screws up an otherwise fun comedic action thriller.","6/10"
"Pixels","filmguru11","22 July 2015","NASA sends a message containing video games, footage from old T.V. shows, and interviews from celebrities like Madonna into space, to communicate with intelligent life forms, who misinterpret them as a declaration of war. The aliens thereafter attack Earth as pixelized versions of characters from popular 80's arcade games.Adam Sandler along with Kevin James, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage star in the sci-fi comedy Pixels, portraying former arcade game champs, called upon to save the planet from the attacking video game characters of the 80's. The film utilizes nostalgia and video games to its advantage to develop an emotional connection with the audience wholived during that era, as well as connecting with the current generation.The comic timing from Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Josh Gad were spot on. The actors were right in their comfort zone and honestly attempting exactly what was expected of them. Peter Dinklage was also good but there were times where his loud egoistic character was just plain annoying. Michelle Monaghan rounds up the loud ensemble group playing the strong single mother and White House military adviser. The special effects were wonderful and the video game characters with their vibrant colors looked fantastic. The gamer within was particularly overjoyed to see characters from popular games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Centipede. Other lesser known games like Tetris and Asteroids are also portrayed and will take audience members back to the memorable time they spent playing arcade games. A blink and miss shot of Toru Iwatani (creator of Pac- Man) during the opening sequence, will have fanatics ecstatic. Later in the movie a lovely tribute is bestowed upon Iwatani, thanking him for giving the world one of the most popular games of all time.Pixels overall is a fun ride if you just sit back and try not to analyze the film for what it really is – light-hearted entertainment that does not go over the top. It may seem nonsensical, but it is enjoyable and a cool blast from the past.","9/10"

I do get why some people hated this movie but we loved it - for me its a mark of a good movie if my daughter sits through it and then talks about it loads afterwards, especially when there was so much of it that she obviously didn't properly understand. There was no 'boring' bits for either of us and loads of laugh-out-loud moments.My highlight was the small Dan Akroyd cameo near the beginning and I especially loved the scene in the bar a bit later on when Adam Sandler whips out a bottle of Akroyd's crystal head vodka - the best, most subliminal bit of product placement I have ever seen in a movie. I was the only person in the cinema giggling at this!","10/10"
"Pixels","stevendbeard","24 July 2015","I saw ""Pixels"", starring Adam Sandler-Blended, The Longest Yard_2005; Kevin James-The Paul Blart movies, 50 First Dates; Michelle Monaghan- Mission:Impossible 3, Mr. & Mrs. Smith; Josh Gad-The Wedding Ringer, The Rocker and Peter Dinklage-Game of Thrones_tv, X-Men:Days of Future Past.I like some of Adam Sandlers' movies and some, I don't. This one was pretty good. It starts in 1982 with Adam, Kevin, Josh & Peter-portrayed as kids, of course-and they are doing what most kids did during that time period, play arcade video games. For those not old enough to know, back then you had stores-or arcades-that had lots of video games that you played by inserting a quarter in to a slot. Adam and Peter were in a championship arcade game contest and the video of their match is put into a time capsule-along with other stuff, too-and sent into space, in search of intelligent life on other planets. Switch to the present and it seems that the intelligent life that found the space capsule misunderstood the intentions of us fun loving earthlings and thought it was a declaration of war. They developed attacking squads made of energy that are based on the arcade games-such as Pacman, Donkey Kong, Centipede and Space Invaders-and they use videos of 1980's celebrities with their voices dubbed to convey their demands. One of the funniest ones is Hall & Oates. Adam now works for an electronics store-think Best Buy-and he makes home installations or repairs. Kevin is now the President of the U.S.-think Chris Christie-but he is still friends with Adam. Josh still lives at home with his grandmother and believes in lots of conspiracy theories. Peter is in prison, fantasizing about a three way with Serena Williams & Martha Stewart. When the aliens start attacking, guess who Kevin calls on? His old arcade gaming buddies because, who else would know how to fight giant centipedes? Michelle is in the military and helps develop the weapons Adam and company use. There are several cameos; I remember seeing Dan Aykroyd, Sean Bean, Brian Cox and Jane Krakowski. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and video game violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.","10/10"

"Pixels","buny101","25 July 2015","Please don't feed the ego or family of Adam Sandler. Look, I genuinely like Sandler. I am a fan of many of his movies, but this one is not a good movie. He plays a video game nerd that had a chance of making it big as a child, only to come in second place, and thus be regulated to a life of drudgery. Having your best friend become president and still want to hang out with you doesn't seem to qualify as ""cool"" or ""awesome."" Just tedious. Now, as an adult, he works as a NERD, a computer guy based on the Geek squad, and installs electronics in homes (when not hanging with the leader of the free world). Aliens attack our planet, using our old video games as the basis of their attacks, and it is up to Sandler, Dinklage, and Lamansoff, all three contenders from a video game competition from 30 years ago, to save the world. There are so many problems with this movie. It's clunky. It's stupid. It can only appeal to small children, and even they must have had some traumatic brain injury to be able to enjoy this movie. Given the premise, of video game superstars fending off video game monsters, you have to know that children are going to be attending in droves. Make it kid friendly. This movie doesn't try to cater to them--a question of what to call a male maggot was answered with, ""Mangina?"" a cross between maggot and vagina. Funny? No. Not at all. Did the children laugh? They didn't understand. Now...am I supposed to explain to my 8 year old what a ""mangina"" is? The rest of the cast just phoned in their parts. I paid 17 dollars for popcorn and soda, and the the tickets were free. I could have stayed at home and watched it for free in a couple of months, and would have saved 17 bucks. Please, don't make the same mistake I did.","10/10"

I know you all gonna complain about how Adam Sandler barely try to be a good actor at the movie, that the jokes are stupid, and the movie it's not fun at all. I agree with all that, how ever it's like watching San Andreas and waiting to see a good plot instead of San Francisco being destroyed. I am sorry if you are watching this movie for a plot, YOU ARE AT THE WRONG MOVIE, easy like that, plot suck, jokes fail to be fun and this is true. How ever if you are a video game fan, you played the arcades at the 80, or had your Atari at home you will just enjoy seeing the video games you loved on the big screen.With that said, I will give the movie 7 for the video games action and nothing else.

Yes because in cinema hall I found most of the people confused just because they don't know the rules of the games like pacman,etc. They were trying to figure out that why pacman died with a car. So the people who rated down this movie maybe didn't knew about gaming much. But if you are a gamer then must watch this because you can understand whats going.

"Pixels","P3n-E-W1s3","5 March 2017","So here's my guilty little secret - I like Adam Sandler films...Even though he's done some real dross in his career he's brought out a movie or three that has made me laugh out loud, from Airheads back in 1994 and including The Wedding Singer, Little Nicky, Mr Deeds, Eight Crazy Nights, 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, Bedtime Stories, Funny People, and now Pixels.I love the fact that it makes a parody of the Voyager space probes, which contained golden records containing information about Earth, should an alien race find them... and be able to play them!Now, I was a kid in the 70's and 80's so I remember Arcades and the hours and money spent on Invaders, Asteroids, and Pacman. I could never get the handle of Defender, though. So this movie spoke to me right from the opening shot. So our future hero's are the nerds of their time taking part in a great Arcade Shoot-Out, where it comes down to two players, Eddie, portrayed brilliantly by Peter Dinklage, who gives a nice air of sleaziness to the character and his ""Hard Guy"" voice is great, and Brenner, played by Sandler (who does another great portrayal of Adam Sandler :-) ).Brenner loses and this loss paves the way for his future fate as he never quite gets to become the person he dreamed of in his youth. However, his best friend Will Cooper fares better and is elected as the President of the United States. So when the strange attacks on the Good Ol' US of A cause concern and the heads of security cannot figure out what is happening President Cooper spots something familiar on a video clip and calls in his friend Brenner for help.This is a totally outlandish plot, which the actors, writers, and director do a fantastic job of playing straight and make the comedy about the situations and narrative. The scene where the creator of Pacman meets his ""Sweet Little Boy"" is well thought out and is a perfect example of this.And the scene where Brian Cox's and Sean Bean's characters become ""Extra Close"" made me laugh out loud... very loud... loved it. The director, Chris Columbus, uses all of the actors and each of them gives a good performance to build character and comedic situations. Not one of them feels like they would rather be elsewhere; this makes for a better film. He also keeps the pace going as the action ramps up to the finale.To be honest, I cannot find a single fault with this film. Yes, Adam Sandler's acting dexterity isn't of the highest calibre, but in this film, he tones down the outrageousness of some of his previous movies and it works well within the story and movie, so it's not a drawback here.And since I can relate to the film, as well as it making me laugh a lot and giving me a nice warm and happy feeling, this has now elevated it to the upper ranks of my favourite comedy films.I would recommend this to all, just sit back and let the happy come...","10/10"
"Pixels","danielnoble-79627","13 August 2015","I went to see Pixels today with my sister (aged 12) and we both thought it was fantastic. I don't understand why people are hating this movie, but it deserves far more than a 5.5 rating. This movie was MUCH better than I expected!This movie brings back the joyful memories of the 80s, featuring very famous classic arcade characters. Except this time, they're all packed into one hilarious, action-packed adventure! There was great comedy throughout this movie which made me laugh a lot. It's perfect for all the family because there is different comedy to suit different age groups, and there is only a small bit of swearing, which younger ones won't exactly recognize (there was a family in the same row as me with a child who looked about four, and he was saying after the film it was the 'Best Movie Ever'). Also, the animation of the pixelated arcade characters is very fluent and very very impressive, which is amazing when combined with the action of the movie. I can't think of anything that disappoints with this movie, however, there are some clear goofs which makes parts of the movie briefly confusing at times. That said, it doesn't really affect this fantastic movie in any way.Please ignore the critics reviews- perhaps they were terrible at the video games and hate to see them again :D? If you're not sure about the film and you think it looks terrible, trust me, it's better than it looks (like the Lego Movie) and it's the perfect treat this summer.","7/10"

He did a respectable job, here. He didn't use an annoying, funny voice, he isn't dressed like a female version of himself, and his character isn't a pathetic loser, like in many of his films.He does a good job portraying his character. Kevin James is likable, as well. They're pretty transparently shooting for a Ghostbusters vibe with this, but, it's forgivable, because it mostly works.This is far from a perfect movie. I can't say I laughed out loud, partially because of the weirdly hostile audience. The folks I was watching the movie with seemed unwilling to give the movie a chance, so I think very few of them enjoyed it. Too bad.Go see it expecting a fun movie, with a flawed plot, great special effects, and reasonably believable characters. Don't expect it to be ""Gone With The Wind"" and you might have yourself a nice time watching this. It helps if you were about 15 when Donkey Kong and Q-Bert hit the arcades. Or not.

The scene with the girl scouts was typical female in that they started screaming at the President when he corrected one of the girl scouts that was being a brat. The main problems arose with Josh Gad's character when he started screaming like a rabid homo and later at the end when the offspring looked like little Q-berts. Babies with some sort of special abilities (shape changing, etc. like in ""Son of the mask"") would have been fine but the two humans having baby Q-berts was a stupid. I had actually considered adding this movie to the collection for later viewing when it's released but with Josh Gad's one weird scene and the Q-bert babies I doubt I will get it.","1/10"
"Pixels","RemusGrey","11 October 2015","Pixels is all about aliens on 1982 who intercepts video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) in an all-out battle to save the planet. Pixels is based on a Youtube short with the same title (Pixels) created by Patrcik Jean. Adam Sandler's movies always has these kind of good ideas but with something really wrong. The problem were some of the jokes. They fell flat, really flat. That's the first problem of the movie, flat jokes. The second problem is the acting of Sandler. To be honest, Kevin James acting was okay. Josh Gad's and Peter Dinklage's acting was very good, but the weakest is Michelle Monaghan's who doesn't look like she likes her role. Adam Sandler's acting is worse than Monaghan's. Sandler is not trying to give his best, and he ended up looking like he gave up in acting. He was better in Hotel Transylvania where he looked like he was happy with his role. But the biggest problem yet is its promotion. No, it's not the marketing and advertisements, it's what it wants others to do such as yell at their parents, be disrespectful to others, etc. It was advertised a lot to children but swearing and those what I listed? Those are very unacceptable to kids. And finally, the lack of story. All just for laughs. However, that should be part of your expectations for the movie. That's what is always part of a Sandler movie, no story and all for laughs. But there is one thing that is rare in Sandler films, the films being enjoyable. If Adam Sandler and Kevin James wasn't here, I'm very sure it would have a 6.7 - 7.5 score since it was directed by Chris Colombus, director of Harry Potter and Home Alone which had a 7.0+ score. Pixels is just like watching someone play a ""Wreck-it Ralph meets Ghostbusters"" level. Although charmless, it is as fun as the best video game level there is. I don't care if haters will bash me or hurt me with their words just because I enjoyed Pixels. It actually didn't deserve hatred.7/10P.s. Apologies for short and rushed review.

It's amazing looking at the transformation of video games. The time that was most nostalgic for much of the older generation was during the 1980s when video gaming was starting to become a big thing. Kids around the nation would line up in front of buildings filled with arcade machines looking to spend their 25 cents to see who would be the next gaming king. It was a time when things were much simpler but still just as fun. French director Patrick Jean had an interesting idea. What would it be like if the video games we used to play with began attacking our world? What would happen? For the two-minute short film that Jean provided, it was a unique idea. For this big screen production of Jean's idea, the concept remains the same but now it has things added to it that don't make it as fun. Adam Sandler plays Sam Brenner, a frustrated electronics repairman who longs for his gaming days back in the 80s. However he gets this opportunity after what appears to be old video games attacking the city. So he gathers up his associates, Cooper (Kevin James), Ludlow (Josh Gad) and Eddie (Peter Dinklage) to help fight back. With a screenplay penned by Tim Herlihy (a frequent Sandler collaborator) and Timothy Dowling (Role Models (2008)) knowing what might be included in the story ended up being predictable. A major element that wasn't necessary to include was the love interest subplots for multiple characters. Practically every main character has a struggling relationship with somebody and they all look to better themselves. Brenner ends up meeting a divorced mom, Violet (Michelle Monaghan) only through forced exposition of her son. What child talks to a stranger like that? There's also Ludlow's fantasy of being with Lady Lisa from a game he plays. Even Brenner's childhood rival Eddie wants to be with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams. All these threads tally up and just pad the film making the momentum slow down. Oh and don't forget the potty humor - a trademark of Happy Madison productions. There's also a series of plot contrivances that make no sense and a number of noticeable continuity errors that add to the confusion of how some video game characters are more developed than others are. A blatant example is Q*bert; how does he have a conscience but not Pac-Man? Even with these problems, this could've been tolerable if the characters were funny. Unfortunately very few are. Kevin James plays one of the goofiest presidents seen on screen and Josh Gad plays it mostly awkward the whole time. Sandler occasionally spews out a line worth of a chuckle because he's trying to sound like an old timer, but it's not often. The rest of the time he just sounds like he's saying whatever came to mind at the time. It doesn't even matter that Sandler is cast with his usual buddies but at least switch up the role. His female co-star is equally sporadic. Dinklage just being snobby stuck up gamer was the best part. There are other appearances from credible actors like Brian Cox, and Sean Bean but they end up being wasted. It's sad that all these issues are just as powerful as the positives. For direction at least, Chris Columbus headed this project instead of Sandler's regulars. The visuals are a nice too. The special effects that make up the video game characters and how they pixilated the surroundings is wonderfully colorful. The director of photography was Amir Mokri (Man of Steel (2013) & Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)), a guy who has plenty of work dealing with blockbuster scope films.The other bonus of to this movie is the nostalgic factor. For those who really enjoyed playing games like Asteroids, Q*bert, Frogger, Super Mario Bros., Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Centipede, Duck Hunt, Tetris, etc. - the fact that seeing these iconic games on the big screen is awesome looking. It does kind of go back to how video game movies don't work though because a gamer would rather play and be interactive than submissive and just watching a game happen. Lastly, the film score was decently made too. Composed by Henry Jackman (this would be his second video game score - his first being to Disney's Wreck-It Ralph (2012)), the score lacks a main theme but does keep the energy moving throughout the action scenes. Even for the slower scenes Jackman has tunes that sound okay. And of course, since this is a film that hearkens back to the 1980s, the soundtrack does include 80s bands like Loverboy and Queen. They even got Daryl Hall and John Oates to play a cameo. That's awesome. The good is equally countered by the bad. It has decent music, colorful special effects, clear cinematography and a large nostalgic factor based on its library of retro video games. Sadly all this is bogged down cliché casting and character development, hit and miss comedy and not enough focus on the video games.","5/10"
"Pixels","Internetghost","31 July 2015","Every single moment of this movie embarrassed me, there only a few redeeming qualities in this filth and that was the admittedly eye popping visuals in terms of the arcade games and the charming performance of Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones, that is where the positives end for this waste of film. This movie has no idea what it wants to be or who it's target audience is because it plays out like a typical Adam Sandler vehicle just with video games added in so he can cash in on gamer's nostalgia for arcade games. None of the jokes were funny and were underwhelming, Josh Gad annoyed the crap out of me, there is absolutely no love put into this movie and is the very definition of a missed opportunity, there is so much that could have been done with the concept yet the potential was disposed of just so that Sandler can continue to steal our money with predictable idiotic humor that isn't even witty, sarcastic, clever, or self-referential or even a shred of respect for the classic games put on display. I felt embarrassed for the talent that was wasted for this film such as director Chris Columbus, Michelle Monaghan, Sean Bean, and Peter Dinklage, they deserved better than this. In conclusion I hated this movie, it had massive potential but instead massively disappointed me. In short don't see it at all, you have much better choices in theatres right now. My grade: F","7/10"
"Pixels","momChrist24","19 October 2015","I am by no means an Adam Sandler fan! But this movie was very, very good. I watched it with my kids and we had a BLAST!!! Maybe it's because I remember arcades, and they have played a few old school games... But we thought it was totally tubular XD. We were actually pleasantly surprised by this movie. I've even heard that people are blowing it off simply because of Adam. Look like I said, not a big fan. But the story line was promising, and he has had a few good ones... The one thing I will say about his movies is that I would love to have most of their soundtracks. So don't be so quick to judge. You never know when or where you'll find a new favorite!!!","8/10"
"Pixels","billygoat1071","28 August 2015","Pixels is getting a lot of gripe either because it's an Adam Sandler movie or it apparently rips off a Futurama episode. But putting those complains aside, this movie is designed to be nostalgic to the times when we admire these classic arcade games. But it's tough having that kind of magic since, as most people were right, Sandler's humor and clichés keep getting in the way. There is some fun ideas that the film could have explored more often than the standard tropes of its star, but for some reason, it's impossible. While Pacman and Donkey Kong are truly timeless, Sandler just keeps beating the dead horse of his glory days. The best part of the entire movie is the opening, where we see the childhood of the main characters spend their time at the arcade. It shows the culture where videogames impact the lives of these kids until they grow up. And then, the world has gotten weird at the present day. Aside the fact that one of the kids is now the President of the United States, the movie finally sticks to the collection of Adam Sandler movie clichés. Even though the aesthetics kind of established something larger-than-life here and there, the movie rather focuses on how Sam Brenner tries to hook up with the pretty girl he just met and his unexciting life as an adult. When the aliens invade, there is some colors to be appealed for, but again, the focus is subdued by a number of subplots from each of its main characters.And that's the serious problem of the film; of course it's a comedy that doesn't need to take itself seriously and prioritize more on the laughs, but the humor is clearly not as inspired as it wants to be. We're still being pushed to this romantic subplot that isn't really that interesting, also Brenner and his gang are being degraded for being nerds even though they act more like downright weirdos. These bits are hardly worth rooting for. When it comes to the main plot itself, it's often illogical, but it doesn't quite matter. But the best punchline through that nonsense is when one of the players used cheat codes in the aliens' game IN REAL LIFE. It indicates that even the screenwriters have no idea how these work and it's funny because they just throw it in idiotically without this ""self-aware"" reaction, like what they did to Q- Bert in the end.The action is quite impressive at least. The special effects bring a lot of energy and visual candy on screen. It's pretty cool seeing these games come to life with this scale and cause mayhem whatever place they stumble in. But again, the camera just can't move away from the characters. The acting isn't really that special, even when they're trying. Adam Sandler is still the lazy Sandler we see, no matter how many times he is claimed as a nerd. Michelle Monaghan is unable to shine due that her role is written as a cliché. Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage have the enthusiasm, even if the script is supposed to make them obnoxious, but they are the sole charm among these main characters.Pixels is far from Sandler's worst; we could spare it for the impressive craft, entertaining ideas and some rare jokes that work which are intentional and otherwise. But overall, nobody wants to see this type of movie anymore. It could have worked if it was made in the last decade or two, when the actor is still not getting much heat from the audience yet. This movie seeks for nostalgia, but the nostalgia we'd rather see is the classic games than Sandler's old tricks. And it's quite sad that the filmmakers did try to build something crazier in this world; there are aliens and a robot in this movie! But it keeps moving away to the least interesting parts. That side only gets interesting when the screenwriters got things wrong, like the fact that the heroes fight better than the military only because they grew up with the games or, again, the cheat codes. There's an opportunity of fun hinted along the sides, but again, Sandler's fingerprints are too inevitable.","7/10"
"Pixels","starry42","25 July 2015","So far this decade, Adam Sandler has churned out one awful movie after another. From ""Jack & Jill"" to ""That's My Boy"", his efforts at entertainment have been atrocious. Then along comes ""Pixels"", which shows possible signs of redemption for Mr. Sandler.""Pixels"" is simply an enjoyable and fun day at the cinema, and it does not try to be anything more. Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, and Peter Dinklage team up as four video game experts who come from different walks of life. Sandler is a TV installer, James is the president of the United States, Gad is a conspiracy theorist, and Dinklage is a criminal. They are called to order when an alien race sends down attack squadrons in the form of classic video game characters. From Pac-Man to Donkey Kong, it appears that the world is headed for a disaster of pixelated proportions. Can Sandler and his gang save the world, or is it game over?Director Chris Columbus, who wrote classic 80s films like ""Gremlins"" and ""The Goonies"" and directed classics like ""Home Alone"" and the first two Harry Potter films, did a great job at bringing all these characters to life. The effects look pretty impressive, and the chemistry among the actors is certainly believable. Bottom line, I enjoyed the film as both a gamer and a sucker for 80s pop-culture, which there is plenty of referenced. In the end, I would recommend it to those with these similar taste. It is certainly not a movie for everyone.","7/10"
"Pixels","cesarsaburi","28 July 2015","I kind liked this movie even though reminded me another movie called Ghostbusters by the format they've recorded the ""war"" between actors and the ""enemies"". The story is about video game and people from different ages can watch it without any problems on understanding old models and new models of arcades. What is most interesting is the fact the we identify great elements such as love, action, hate, the good guy, the bad guy well sizzled thru the screenplay. One thing that we really need to celebrate during this movie is the Animation and Graphics. The Crew did a great job reconstruction video game actions, scenes and real-life conflicts with the actors. I really I recommend to watch it, I'm sure will have some fun.","7/10"
"Pixels","Hellmant","6 August 2015","'PIXELS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Adam Sandler's big budget sci-fi comedy bomb; about an alien invasion, in the form of classic 80s 8-bit video game characters. Sandler stars in the movie, with his buddy Kevin James; along with Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Monaghan, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Jane Krakowski. It was directed by Chris Columbus (who's famous for directing such popular hits as 'ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING', 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE', the first two 'HOME ALONE' films and the first two 'HARRY POTTER' movies) and it was written by Tim Herlihy (Sandler's buddy, who also co- wrote 'BILLY MADISON', 'HAPPY GILMORE', 'THE WEDDING SINGER', 'THE WATERBOY' and other hit Sandler flicks) and Timothy Dowling (who also co-wrote the Sandler film 'JUST GO WITH IT'). It was based on the 2010 2- minute French animated short, of the same name, by Patrick Jean. It's not nearly as bad as the reviews make it out to be, or the film's Box Office; it's actually pretty entertaining (for an Adam Sandler movie, at least). The movie takes place sometime in the near future, when aliens have misinterpreted a video feed, from earth, featuring classic 80s 8-bit video games, as a declaration of war. So they attack our planet, in the form of characters from those games. Sandler, James, Dinklage and Gad all play former child video game whizzes, from the 80s, who now need to use their skills to combat the alien invasion. They're given three specific game challenges, in which, upon defeat, they'll lose a life (and someone is abducted). When they lose all three lives, earth will be destroyed. James's character is also the President of the United States (for some bizarre reason). The movie is a fun 80s throwback; if you grew up with these arcade games, you should get a kick out of it. The effects are just OK, and it's not especially funny, but it is entertaining; it's a fun summer popcorn flick, at least. It's much better than Sandler's usual slapstick garbage, especially the stuff he's been putting out lately, and it's nice to see him branching out, and trying different things. This is at least somewhat different; he's never done an action movie before. It's also a good kids' film, and it's not too dumbed-down; especially for an Adam Sandler movie!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0-wDtevNo","10/10"
"Pixels","keithlovesmovies","27 July 2015","When a race of aliens intercept a videotape containing footage of classic video games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they decide to attack Earth using those games as weapons. In order to combat them, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his old childhood friend and former classic video game champion and current ""nerd installer"" Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of classic video game players Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) and Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and also a colonel and weapons developer Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) to try to save the planet.After reading some of the other reviews for this film, I found that most people did not like this film. I understood some of their points but I didn't think it is as bad as they made it out to be. I just want to say that despite the fact that the trailer makes it look like the film is for kids, it is not. This film is recommended for at least teens. Adam Sandler's films this last decade have been rather hit or miss but mostly misses and this one is not a miss but is not quite a hit either. Just like his films, the jokes in this one are hit or miss but in this case, they are mostly hits with some misses. The acting in this film wasn't remarkable either. Adam Sandler plays the same character he has played in numerous other films. The role could have probably been played by another actor and be just as good if not better. Kevin James is serviceable as President Cooper. Josh Gad was good as the clumsy, fat guy Ludlow and got to recite some of the film's funniest one-liners. Peter Dinklage's Eddie was arguably trying too hard. Michelle Monaghan's Violet was OK but had no chemistry with Sam which made their romantic scenes a little cringe-worthy and unbelievable. Sure the story doesn't make too much sense either but the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously and does a decent job of not taking itself too seriously either. For me, the best part of the film has to be the special effects. The way in which they bring all the classic video games to life was rather good. All of the classic video games of the 80s were well represented which was appreciated. The way in which people go in and out of pixelation and how environments got destroyed via pixelation was nice to see. I was also curious as to how they were able to alter old 80s video footage as well (I won't spoil why this happens). This film is nowhere near the best film of the year and will probably not be on any best of thew year lists but I was entertained. If you just turn off your brain and suspend belief and except what you are given, I think you'd all enjoy it too.keithlovesmovies.com","3/10"

"Pixels","mdanielle-94261","25 March 2016","I'm not putting a spoiler warning because it shouldn't be a shock to people with half a brain that Happy Madison productions is the equivalent of a drooling, brain dead child that's only able to utter his own name. The plot is in line with a 1980s Saturday morning cartoon.I'd like to think that the writers and directors all drank jagermeister and got beaten over the heads with bats and then wrote this bomb of a story.Adam Sandler is just like he was during the Christmas bomb, 8 Crazy Nights. He's needlessly cruel to the ""love interest"" and is a terrible chore to sit through, enough said. Also, the addition of the White House and the military of all things is stupidly insulting because is renders the two as one big dumb,unfunny joke. One of the many, many dumb jokes that this movie pulls is 1980s references that are 100% witless and vapid. Bottom line, the movie is like Kylie and Kendall Jenner.

Paul Blart, The Mall Cop is President of the United States, and Happy Gilmore, the voice of Olaf the Snowman and the children's author that Will Ferrell calls ""Elf"" are going to attempt to save the world from alien invaders using 1980's video games. I was surprised that my ten and seven year old girls liked it too. However, they had many questions about the references to the '80's pop stars and icons and many of the arcade games meant nothing to them. If you spent any time in the arcades in the early eighties then I am pretty sure you will appreciate this movie!","10/10"

Anyways, this movie was a fun movie. It has such an amazing plot and the special affects were the best I've ever seen. I just think Adam could've tried harder. He is obviously capable of amazing things its just that he needs to try more. Id say it was worth my time and money, its concept was freaking amazing! If everyone tried their complete hardest, this movie would have been a Smash Hit. In my opinion Adam is a very funny guy and I just love that he wont quit making movies. I just loved how pacman looked and the whole idea of the small cars as the ghosts, it was just straight genius","8/10"
"Pixels","LadyMargaret","26 July 2015","Note: I saw the film in standard format not 3D or IMAX. ***Potential spoiler for the ending of the film though I think most readers will already know what that ending is before seeing the movie if readers are in the correct frame of mind to view the film.***I enjoyed this movie! In fact, it surprised me with its depth of themes that I was not expecting from a jaunt down gaming memory lane.Brenner's honest portrayal of male self-respect and leadership and the effect his portrayal has on those around him is strength of character personified and is a robust genuine male role model for young boys and adult men.The arcade scene was a powerful positive statement to which all children of all ages can relate, and, if taken to heart, empowers and liberates children from one of the greatest fears of childhood. The scene was done in a most natural way. It was a showing without the telling which is what excellent story writing is meant to be.I found a richness of human connection in this film that didn't insult my intelligence and was humorous and believable against the backdrop of a fanciful circumstance. Predictable plot? Yes, but genuine enough to bring a smile to the face and enjoy the familiarity of that plot like a favorite amusement park ride that you want to ride over and over again. Some plot holes? Yes, but should one care? Not if one has taken the time to see the movie from the eyes of a child enjoying the fun of the ride over and over again.Should all movies be verbose in development, dark, and complicated with political social undertones to be excellent or good? This is a fun ""feel good"" kid's movie of pretend play where for once the good guys win, save the world, and get the girl without any shades of gray. It is a wonderful suspension of adult cynicism to return to the creative world of a child's imaginative mind.I don't know the history of Sandler's movies. It seems that most critics dislike his movies. This was the first movie of Sandler's that I saw and it was good wholesome fun on many levels. Maybe that cynicism of Hollywood and the critics is why the world is such a dark scary place for children.We need more men in the world like Sandler's character, Brenner.","5/10"

"Pixels","sweeeetmikey","25 August 2015","PIXELS review by Mike Smith When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of a video games.I could not wait to see this movie, but I liked PIXELS in a whole different way. The movie doesn't have a lot of hard laughs and every time there was an opportunity for one, it dropped the ball. That being said there are lots of chuckles.The cast works really well together but that's not a shock because most of them are part of the Happy Madison family. PIXELS doesn't really pick up until we see Josh Gad. Adam Sandler may be the star of the film but all the best lines and funny parts are given to Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage. Also, keep your eyes open for Dan Aykroyd and the product placement of his crystal head vodka.PIXELS has a nice blend of light laughs, romance, sci-fi, gun action and car action. The film moves at a nice pace and it goes by fast. This film is fun for the whole family, young and old; the music is a 80s greatest hits soundtrack and really ties the film together.The c.g is fun, cute and really well done... One thing that bugged me the first time I watched PIXELS was that Q-Burt could talk. But then after the 2nd viewing, I figured that he is an alien not the real game character and he is a big part of the movie so he has to speak. Another thing that PIXELS does is point out the generation gap, but as someone who plays a lot of classic arcade games, I'm shocked that some kids don't know about arcades. Hopefully this film will make younger kids want to find and play arcade classics.I'm so happy about this film, I was hoping for big laughs and even though there weren't any, it wasn't a let down. The story was good, the action was fun and it was awesome seeing my favorite classic arcade games come to life in the real world.

"Pixels","Carycomic","25 July 2015","First of all; I will make a startling confession. This is the first live-action Adam Sandler film I've gone to see since 1996's BULLETPROOF. It's true! I thought he completely ruined that movie for Damon Wayans! Which is why I've never seen HAPPY GILMORE, BILLY MADISON (the obvious inspirations for the name of his own production company), or any other flick he's been in, this side of HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA.But, just as Will Farrell did for me with ELF, so Sandler has done for me with this salute to the classic video arcade games of the 1980's. And, part of that is due to Sandler et al. recruiting Peter Dinklage as Eddie. The latter, whom I first saw on the shamefully underrated 2005 s.f. series THRESHOLD, co-starred in ELF as a bad-tempered author of children's stories. And, I absolutely loved how he kicked Farrell's elfin butt in that Xmas flick!Well, Mr. Dinklage does the same thing here. Only, in this case, he plays Eddie Plant, the video game equivalent of a pool shark who is shamelessly egotistical. He does whatever it takes to win the game. And, in a way, Sam Brenner (Sandler's character) winds up doing the same thing. More specifcally; having to undergo a show-down with the title character of the one arcade game he could never win as a kid. Donkey Kong!Of course, most of his inspiration comes from the lovely divorced army colonel (played by Michelle Monaghan, whom I've admittedly never heard of before; although I, too, would brush my teeth four times a day for her!) who works for the Defense Department. And, as expected in a somewhat romantic comedy, they get their own personal happy ending. As do Josh Gad (""Ludlow"") and Alice Benson (""Lady Lisa,"" a XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS-type video game).Now, don't get me wrong. Some of the jokes I heard were utter failures at making me laugh. But, the mental picture I got of Mr. Dinklage, Martha Stewart, and Serena Williams made me all but roll on the floor of the theater laughing!Which, alone, is why I find this movie four stars funnier than TRAINWRECK. A film so bitterly disillusioning, as romantic comedies with supposedly sympathetic characters go, that I feared I might not see anything worthy of being called truly comedic, on the silver screen, this summer. But, I was ultimately proved wrong. And, as Brian Cox-- playing Admiral Porter--might say: ""This film blows TRAINWRECK out of the water!""","1/10"
"Pixels","TheHonestCritic","18 July 2021","""Pixels"" (2015), I remember when I first saw the teaser for this ""movie"", when I watched it, I was immediately intrigued. It looked like a funny and very creative concept. Seriously, extraterrestrials misinterpreted as video game characters attacking Earth in a declaration of war, using technology that was inspired by various video games. Doesn't that just scream excitement? Then, I saw the studios behind it all, Sony Pictures and Happy Madison. Plus, Adam Sandler was part of the cast. Alarms went off in my head right away. Now, I'm not saying I hate Adam Sandler as an actor and film maker overall, he has been involved with a few good and some great movies in his career. But, a handful of them are utter trash. Even after I saw Adam Sandler was in the cast, I still wanted to see this ""movie"". I planned on going to see it in a theater, but several things came up in my life and I didn't get a chance to go see it during it's theatrical release, thank God for that! Soon after it's release on DVD, I saw that it was going to be on TV one night. So, I watched it, since it was 100% free at that time. Let me just say this, you guys. This is one of the most poorly executed films I have ever seen. ""Pixels"" has a cliched and boring storyline, standard to horrible acting, and a predictably generic soundtrack to try and tie it all together. As I mentioned before, the plot for this ""film"" is a very clever concept. Aliens recreated as evil versions of video game characters invade Earth? That was a fun and unique storyline practically gift-wrapped for the writers and film makers! But, apparently they got morons involved and none of the brilliant opportunities were taken advantage of at all. Adam Sandler's production company, Happy Madison, has ruined yet another cool idea, again! This is really starting to aggravate me. ""Pixels"" is stuffed to the brim with cliche after cliche, dull and boring dialogue, uninspired action scenes and a lack of creativity with the villains. There are so many awesome video games out there that they could have used for this ""film"". Sadly, they chose a few of probably the most boring ones in arcade game history. The only one out of this group that I actually like, is Pac-Man. Why? Because everyone, including me, can look at that character and know where it's from, whether you've played that game or not. Overall, the plot was poorly executed, next to nothing of interest happens and the script sounds like it was written by people on drugs. Probably the saddest thing is, that it didn't have to suck. It could've been, and should've been so much more. I honestly could've wrote a better script in less than two hours! As far as the acting goes, it's just as big a letdown. The only actors that seem to be trying here are: Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean. Their acting was not too bad. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast was just plain mediocre, especially Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Josh Gad. To give Adam Sandler some credit, he's not a bad actor overall in his career. But, Kevin James and Josh Gad are not funny, nor will they ever be funny in any form of media. Why do those two keep getting cast in films and TV shows? The acting is just a joke from the majority of the cast! As far as the soundtrack goes, it's a big disappointment. When I saw who composed this ""film"" score, I was very surprised. Henry Jackman wrote the music! Usually, he writes decent music for any movie he gets involved in. What happened to him here? Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of filth. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a nice atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. Yes, they do get a little cheesy, but that was the intent, since the villains are classic video game characters. ""Pixels"" is yet another letdown in the world of Adam Sandler movies. One thing I loathe in the film and animation industry is wasted potential. This ""movie"" is the epitome of wasted potential, they had a phenomenal concept and yet they somehow screwed it up. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from this ""film""? Unless you're a fan of the video games that this ""movie"" is based on, you'd be much better off skipping it. To tell you the truth, I have more fun playing the video games instead!","7/10"

"Pixels","zendaddy621","24 July 2015","First off, I will acknowledge that I happen to be a big fan of 80s nostalgia as well as retro video games, so maybe I enjoyed this film more than others. For those of you who might be averse to the presence of Adam Sandler and/or Kevin James, note that both are quite subdued in this film, especially since the real stars are the video game characters who are invading Earth. The action sequences are all brightly colored and fast paced as well as fun to watch, and since everything the aliens destroy simply pixelates and disappears, the ""violence"" is more comical than anything. Peter Dinklage also takes a surprisingly comic turn in his role as the all-time video game champion; few, if any, jokes are related to his short stature. If you're not willing to spend the money to see ""Pixels"" in the theater, do yourself a favor and at least rent it when it's released on DVD. If you watch this movie without preconceived notions, you might be pleasantly surprised.","2/10"
"Pixels","dustin-31007","15 August 2015","Adam Sandler and crew don't even try to pretend to try anymore. This film is so bad, that I don't even know if Rifftrax/MST3K would be able to do anything with it. I believe the reviews on the first two pages of reviews are either fake, or paid for by the studio to desperately try to compensate for how bad this film was trashed by critics and users alike. Notice that almost all of them follow the same pattern of saying things like ""don't believe the reviews / don't trust the critics / etc."" I'd be very suspicious of all those reviews. Think about it, how would a film get so universally trashed by critics and fans alike, and then suddenly there are a bunch of recent 10 star reviews--very suspicious. I don't always care for critics either, but in this case, they are absolutely right . . . this film stinks big-time.The scene where Sandler's love interest is introduced is so flat and predictable, it literally would have been better if Sandler just looked right into the camera and said to the audience: ""is it cool if you all just accept that this is gonna be my love interest in the film, that just happens to also be an adviser to the president? Yes? O.K. so we can skip this scene? Good. Moving on . . ."" The scene where Kevin James is introduced as Sandler's . . . 80's buddy who's now a business man? nope . . . 80's buddy who's now a video game executive? nope . . . 80's buddy who's now THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?!?! yep . . . you read that right . . . Kevin James just gets casually introduced as PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! This scene is so pathetically unbelievable that I couldn't even fathom how awful it was.Keep in mind that I was a fan of Sandler's earlier work, especially Wedding Singer, SNL, and even up to 50 First Dates, when he actually still tried and made an effort. He literally didn't even lift a finger's worth of effort in this atrocity. He doesn't even pretend to try anymore. Also keep in mind that I did like the initial concept of the 80's time capsule being found and the games brought to life as weapons.I believe that Sandler and crew (i.e. James, et al) simply just decide where they want their next group paid vacation / party to be: New York, London, African Safari (i.e. Blended), etc. etc., have someone write a really cheap, undeveloped excuse for a plot/script, plug in actors from their crew and or friends/relatives of theirs they want to give a shot at stardom, and go on their group vacation / party while kinda/sorta making a movie at the same time.Dinklage makes an effort, but the writers make his character so stupid and one dimensional that it is almost a miracle that he was able to do anything with it.The only other actor who makes an effort in this film is Josh Gad, and he has the only genuinely funny scene in the movie where he gets to give a bunch of Navy Seals the ""Drill Sergeant"" treatment.Other than that 45 seconds, this film is pathetic. Probably in my top 10 worst movies I've ever seen list.","10/10"
"Pixels","mjohnston-30484","15 October 2015","I wish I knew why this title was rated so poorly, I just got finished watching it with my son (12 y/o), and we both really enjoyed it. Adam Sandler does a great job, toning down his normal over reactive and colourful style, which is a nice thing as far as I'm concerned. When you get past that part of him, he's really a very capable actor.Overall the acting was well done, the writing was decent (with a lot of 80's references that were fun), it was cast well, and it was visually fun. What more do you expect in a movie of this genre and style? Was it a life changing, moving experience? Of course not, but if that's what you're hoping for, you're doing things wrong. Turn this one on for some fun, some humour, and a couple hours spent with the family that you won't regret.","8/10"

Big name cast all play their parts well, very good effects and a good script.Sure there are plot holes all over the place - like cheat codes in games that didn't even have a keyboard and the cheese factor is way up there - but that was deliberate - it is over the top silly on purpose. I mean the whole premise of aliens seeing the games as a threat and sending them back to challenge Earth to a death match - LOL! Even the love interest in the story is a ham-up.This is a light comedy that gets the laughs and delivers good entertainment value, it does not take itself too seriously and neither should you.I have given this movie what it deserves - it is not a 10 but it certainly is not a 5 or lower that it's average would tell you","9/10"
"Pixels","RforFilm","28 July 2015","Video games have come a long way since it's mainstream debut in the 1980s. Being born in 1987, I wasn't around long enough to see the classic arcade where games like Pac-Man, Q*bert, and Donkey Kong all created a new form of escapism for the youth. Most people weren't too sure what direction these games would go in. No one knew whether they would evolve into something bigger or if they were a fifteen-minute fad. When companies like Nintendo and Sega brought the games home, it was set that these games were here to stay. When Sony and Microsoft connected these games to the Internet, it seemed that the whole world was playing!In a way, most modern games have become like major motion pictures. I say this as a negative as while many games have long cut scenes that establish a full story, much of the action is with how well you can react and push a button rather then a true challenge. Exceptions include Minecraft and World of Warcraft as your poised to create a character and evolve him like most role-playing games or Modern Warfare and Mario Kart, which relies on playability between other players. A blast from the past puts the world on edge in the latest comedy, Pixels. In 1982, young Sam and Will go to a video game championship where Sam does well as a Pac-Man champion, but looses on Donkey Kong from the egocentric Eddie Plant. The event was recorded and placed in a time capsule that was sent into space, hoping that I would reach intelligent life.Cut to 2015 where Sam (played by Adam Sandler) is working as a home theater installer and Will (played by Kevin James) is now the president of the United States. Both seem board with their lives and hope for more.Aliens attack an army base in Guam that seem to turn everything they touch into pixelated forms. The White House examines the creatures to see that they resemble the characters from Galaga. It seems that the aliens misinterpreted the video games as a declaration of war and are attacking the Earth using those games. Will calls Sam to discuss how to defeat these aliens with his arcade skill. They get Eddie (played by Peter Dinklage) out of jail to join the team to fight They go to London to fight Centipede and New York to fight Pac-Man, yet these aliens seem bent on destroying the world.The idea of Pixels is a good one; a great one that could have been the blockbuster comedy that might have reached Ghostbusters levels. But the big problem starts right at the beginning; you see the Happy Madison Productions logo. This company seems to exist to only give comedian Adam Sandler as much work as possible while putting in as little effort for the comedy as possible. I was hoping that director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter) might spark Sandler into stepping up his comedy. IT DOESN'T!Adam Sandler not only plays the same obnoxious man-child he's been playing for the past ten years, but looks depressed through out the entirety of Pixels. Kevin James adds little to nothing, Peter Dinklage is insultingly wasted (though he gets a few laughs), and the rest of the cast serves to buffer Sandler. Story wise, the pixelated characters attack various cities, but I don't recall one person being hurt. With that, Pixels doesn't seem to care if the humans lived or died. Nothing is at stake and what's gained are women which I find sexist. Worst of all, this is a family movie that is speaking to a kid audience who have no idea who Pac-man or Q*bert are. Why even go after the children when they could have gotten an easy adult audience?I'll give this two ""Game Over"" screens out of ten. I'm declaring Game Over for Adam Sandler who doesn't seem to care about genuine comedy or the usage of a funny idea for a movie. This is a game that's not worth anyone's quarters!","8/10"

My wife even cried a bit a couple of times, and my 5+ y.o. son was frightened a couple of times, too :) For modern kids some of the scenes would require a bit of explanation, but my son is familiar with the most big titles of the 80s, so the movie was entertaining for him as well. I'm not too demanding on the plot part, I'm happy that such ""bitxploitation"" movies are filmed at all. The beginning was especially promising and made me a bit sentimental.

"Pixels","mussy_boi_84","13 August 2015","First off... I dislike Adam Sandler movies since the wedding singer. As an actor, he has a very negative and annoying screen presence. I read reviews of this film and it got slated.. I mean I think critics rated human centipede more and my god I was dreading seeing it but my boy wanted to see it and I thought 'why deny him because I think it's going to be dreadful!'.... apart from sandlers lazy acting and same personality as all films this movie was great! The effects even got completely dismissed by so called critics!! They were beautiful... the best you can do with graphics this day and age in regards to pixels! There was stereotyping... typical ""America saves the world again!!"" And some silly gags... bit it was enough to keep me entertained. There is simply a firing squad out for Sandler and I'm starting to feel a little sorry for him as I was one of them, this film was a gamble in my eyes and it should have paid off. CRITICS ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT!! I have learned that now so shame on me! Go and see it... for those that are saying this is the worst film EVER, have you not seen house of the dead???

My son, like most young teenage boys, likes the action thrillers. My daughter likes anything cartoony and cute. They both LOVED this movie! There was some humor that seemed aimed right at the 9 year old (...that the 15 year old didn't find funny), and there was other humor that seemed aimed right at the 15 year old (...that the 9 year old didn't understand). The violence was mild enough that it did not frighten my daughter at all. This old 51-year old even got a few grins out of it. Although it's no masterpiece, it's a fun summer movie that everyone in the family can enjoy. Nothing stupendously original, but a very pleasant way to spend a summer afternoon with the kids.","7/10"
"Pixels","svr-2200","12 November 2017","Pixels: Movie Review.Pixels has a very good concept and story idea about a movie that is about classic video games but it fails very badly to be a good movie. Pixels is not entertaining, nor enjoyable and it's just a dumb film.The direction is very weak. The performances of lead actors, cast and characters are very underdeveloped. There are no real feels to any of the characters in the movie. They all seems to just stand on the screen with no real interests in their characters. The whole cast is very very underutilized. All performances feels and looks very under performed. Pixels lacks the entertaining and enjoyable fun factor of good action comedy movie and its just a dull wastage of very good concept idea. The story plot is very unconvincing and uninteresting and whole feel of the movie is very dull. The storyline idea is good but looks very dumb on the screen in the terms of a good movie and fails to deliver the beauty of its concept. The script, is below average, lacks interesting elements, and has pacing issues. The movie feels very slow and boring in many useless scenes. As a fan of these classic games I was really disappointed by the film. The only positive thing about the movie Pixels is some Visual shots and effects of those old classic arcade games and the performance of Peter Dinklage is good to certain points. Some gaming characters like Pac Man looks good in 3D and some 3D Visual scenes are interesting. Otherwise, all over Pixels has a very good concept idea but fails as a movie and succeed as a one of the major disappointing movies of recent times. Pixels could have been a good movie but sadly it is not.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You).","1/10"

This movie is funny, it has a lot of action, and it is the only movie I've really seen dedicated to gamers. I mean a gamer saving the world?

I was an artist as a child, you might say, and I am just so amazed and tickled at what I find in children's/family movies today!To be honest with you, the reason this gets a higher rating from me is because of the little orange creature that got left behind.

The best performance was by the kid who played the young Adam Sandler. The only way I was able to sit through this film was to phony laugh at all the ""jokes.""

"Pixels","estebangonzalez10","25 July 2015","""I believe that some alien life-force, has sent real life video games, to attack us.""Chris Columbus, the man who directed the first two Harry Potter films as well as Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Adventures of Babysitting, and many more family friendly films that I actually enjoyed, now directs Adam Sandler in Pixels, a film that aims to appeal to those adults that grew up in the early 80's playing classic arcade games, but unfortunately it only ends up being entertaining for younger audiences due to its cliché jokes and formulaic structure. I must confess that I once was a huge Adam Sandler fan and watched everything he did from his Billy Madison days up to Jack and Jill in 2011 (with Chuck and Larry being the only exception, which somehow I miraculously missed). As a young teen I found his movies hilarious, but as I grew older his schtick got repetitive and I somehow decided to give up on him. I hadn't seen another film starring Sandler since Jack and Jill, but decided to give this one a try for nostalgic sake and because Columbus's films usually appealed to me despite his films being overly sentimental at times. It didn't hurt that Peter Dinklage was also starring in this film since I love what he does (his short scene in Elf is one of my favorites and he is awesome in Game of Thrones). All these factors managed to convince me to watch Pixels despite my low expectations and I honestly got what I was expecting. It's as if Adam Sandler directs all his comedies because they are so similar in tone despite never having directed, but I guess the directors always let him improvise and he ends up making the same jokes in every movie. The only positive feedback I'll give Pixels is that it did manage to engage with the younger audiences; my ten year old brother had a blast, so it might make some money at the box office. Based on Patrick Jean's own screenplay for a short film he made in 2010 (which seems far more appealing to me), this feature film opens in the 80's with a group of kids who grew up loving arcade games. Brenner (Anthony Ippolito) is so good at predicting these game patterns that he signs up to compete in an arcade national championship. His closest friend, Cooper (Jared Riley), is there cheering for him and he truly believes Brenner is destined for great things in life. During the tournament they also befriend a young boy named Ludlow (Jacob Shinder) who is obsessed with a cyber game character named Lady Lisa (Ashley Benson). Unfortunately, Brenner is defeated by Eddie (Andrew Bambridge), a loud mouthed arcade lover who goes by the nickname of fire blaster. The film then jumps to the present where we discover Brenner (Adam Sandler) hasn't really accomplished anything in life. He installs technical equipment for a company called Nerd. Cooper (Kevin James) however has become the President of the nation. Nerd sends Brenner to Violet's (Michelle Monaghan) home to install the latest gadgets for her young son Matty (Matt Lintz). Brenner and Violet have a small moment, but when he tries to lean in and kiss her things get ugly between them. Right after that awkward moment Brenner receives a call from Cooper about an alien attack on Earth (and so does Violet who is then revealed to be a Lieutenant). Apparently these aliens have attacked using the arcade game format created through pixels, and the only way to defeat them is similar to the way they played the game. Brenner enlists the help of Ludlow (Josh Gad) and his archenemy Eddie (Peter Dinklage) to try to defeat these alien invaders and save the Earth.As ridiculous or appealing as the premise sounds (depending on whether or not you're nostalgic over these classic arcade games) the greatest problem with Pixels is that its incredibly hard to believe some of the relationships between these characters. The first time Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan's characters meet, the dialogue between them is so phony and forced that it makes it impossible to relate to. That scene was probably one of the worst I've seen all year. Kevin James, Josh Gad, and Brian Cox can be funny people, but they play the same characters they've been playing in recent years. Dinklage's Fire Blaster seems to be either hit or miss for some people, and I actually found his character to be the funniest in the movie. No one here is actually trying hard and the film is proof of that, but audiences that are simply looking to escape for a couple of hours might find it amusing. I still don't know what Jane Krakowski was doing in this film since her character isn't given anything to do despite her comedic talents. She should've been used more. Pixels is recycled Sandler material that will only appeal to hardcore 80's nostalgic gamers and young kids who enjoy pretty much any adventure. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","4/10"

I watch movies for a living and work on many commercially viable productions. This one had promise but fails to entertain due to flawed casting and writing. I would be saddened to see this lame excuse of a feature make break even. Save your dollars and stay clear of Pixels. Most of us saw the trailers and were intrigued by using 21st century cgi to bring back to life our old arcade favorites from the 80s. Yet, it takes more to entertain. You need a plausible story and good casting choices. Besides, you need decent chemistry among lead actors. Everything about this film felt disconnected and awkward. I wanted to like Sam Brenner and his side kicks, but could not help myself but feel indifferent. Could someone please write a decent script for the next Adam Sander comedy?

"Pixels","adaringdo-1","24 July 2015","This review is simple, because the movie didn't know what to be: (1) A COMEDY - not really. There were far too many minutes of mindless dialogue, lack of inventive gags, absence of appropriate wit; (2) A SCIENCE FICTION - absolutely not. There was no science, reasonable explanations, or context; (3) A ROMANCE - Not at all. Whatever human contact the characters had was superficial, boring, and trivial. The opportunity was there but promptly discarded. (4) TRAGEDY - Not in the least, except for perhaps a few minutes toward the end. (5) SPECTACLE - Yes.In effect these elements were touched on, but not one was fully embraced, and by no means explored (except the COLOR-SPECTACLE). There were perhaps 3-4 laughs to be had, one about every 30 minutes. I honestly can't say when it came off the rails, but it was very early on, I would guess when the two arrive at the White House.

"Pixels","zardoz-13","27 July 2015","Combine ""Independence Day"" with ""Ghostbusters"" and then insert Adam Sandler in another of his immature man-child roles as the hero, and you've got the premise of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" director Chris Columbus' predictable, but palatable ""Pixels,"" a nostalgic sci-fi fantasy about the bygone video game arcade era. Initially, you might think Columbus and ""Mr. Deeds"" writer Tim Herlihy and ""Just Go with It"" scribe Timothy Dowling have done little more than synthesize elements of ""Independence Day"" and ""Ghostbusters"" for the ""Saturday Night Live"" alumnus. Actually, the filmmakers have adapted French director Patrick Jean's ephemeral, two-minute short ""Pixels"" (2010) about space invaders masquerading as vintage video game characters. Sadly, everything about Columbus' ""Pixels"" adaptation is wholesome and lukewarm rather than imaginative and mischievous. Since he slipped into middle-age, the 48-year old Sandler hasn't made anything as audacious as his early, lowest-common-denominator farces: ""Billy Madison"" (1995), ""Happy Gilmore"" (1996), ""The Waterboy"" (1998), ""Big Daddy"" (1999), and ""Little Nicky"" (2000). Later, Sandler appeared in comedies with a slightly higher IQ such as his critically acclaimed ""Punch Drunk Love"" (2002), ""Anger Management"" (2003) with Jack Nicholson, ""50 First Dates"" (2004) with Drew Barrymore, ""Click"" (2006) with Christopher Walken, and ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" (2007) with Kevin James. Just as he explored new facets with his image in ""Punch Drunk Love,"" Sandler ventured even further afield with Judd Apatow's heavyweight ""Funny People"" (2009) as a comedian stricken with cancer.Sandler's recent big screen efforts have overshadowed neither ""Punch Drunk Love"" nor ""Funny Business."" Indeed, ""Pixels"" is just as routine as ""Just Go for It"" (2011), ""Grown-Ups"" (2010), its sequel ""Grown-Ups 2"" as well as ""Jack and Jill"" (2011) and ""That's My Boy"" (2012). Although nothing about ""Pixels"" is likely to affront or alienate anybody like ""Jack and Jill"" or ""That's My Boy,"" Sandler's shenanigans as a video gamer wronged in his youth comes off as severely superficial. Nevertheless, Columbus has fashioned a coherent but humorless escapade with some amusing characters that are eclipsed by impressive CGI renderings of several 8-bit video characters, including ""PAC-MAN,"" ""Donkey Kong,"" ""Galaga,"" ""Centipede,"" and ""Space Invaders."" Children of the 1980s who grew up in places around the Friendly City, like Two-Bits behind the old McDonalds on Highway 45 North, The Back Porch in the old McRae's Mall, and Diamond Jim's in the Leigh Mall may cherish fond memories of those days. ""Pixels"" unfolds in 1982 as 13-year old Sam Brenner (Anthony Ippolito) and his best friend Will Cooper (Jared Riley) leap astride their banana-seat bikes and ride off to the first video game arcade to open in their town. Not only does Sam discover he has a knack for defeating Pac-Man and Centipede, but Cooper and he make friends with forlorn 8-year-old Ludlow Lamonsoff (Jacob Shinder) whose only friend is his grandmother. Eventually, Sam takes his gift for winning video games to a Donkey Kong Championship. Unfortunately, he lands in second place behind his chief adversary, snotty, self-centered, 13-year-old Eddie (Andrew Bambridge), who christens himself 'The Fire Blaster.' Interestingly enough, NASA loads up footage of their video game competition in a time capsule and launches it into deep space. Optimistically, NASA hopes to establish peaceful contact with an alien civilization. Meantime, after Eddie trounced him, Sam has turned into a perennial slacker. Basically, Sam lives a low-profile life. Although he got married, his wife cheated on him with their pediatrician. Now, he installs home entertainment systems for a living. Actually, Sandler looks clownish in his bright orange Nerds company outfit that resembles a UPS drivers' uniform. Meantime, Sam's obese buddy Will has plunged into politics and now serves as President. Nevertheless, Will has an appalling habit of putting his foot in his mouth whenever he ventures out into the public eye. Recently, during a reading initiative at a kindergarten, Cooper reprimanded a little girl for correcting his pronunciation. Their friend Ludlow (Josh Gad of ""The Wedding Ringer"") has turned into a conspiracy theorist.Without warning, a mysterious interplanetary force destroys a U.S. military base in Guam. Not only does it convert the base into hundreds of cubes, but it also abducts a security guard. President Cooper assembles his advisers and summons Sam. One of the President's advisers is Lieutenant Colonel Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan of ""Source Code"") who has just separated from her philandering husband. Violet's hubby cheated on her with his 19-year old Pilates instructor. Before they race each other to the White House, Sam and Violet meet at her house after he arrived to install a home entertainment system. Violet and Sam sit in her closet and swap sentimental stories so Violet's teenage son Matty (Matt Lintz of ""The Crazies"") won't see her grieve. Anyway, an enigmatic alien race has acquired the NASA footage, but they have misconstrued it as an invitation to war. Miraculously, Sam's superb video skills make him a highly sought-after individual, and President Cooper assigns Sam and Ludlow to teach Navy SEALS for combat against the aliens. Lieutenant Colonel Van Patten has analyzed the cube debris from Guam, and she has created light-blasting ray guns that smash the aliens to smithereens. President Cooper refuses to act quickly enough to prevent another attack and the aliens destroy the Taj Mahal. Naturally, our heroes whip the aliens with relative nonchalance in one confrontation after another in this PG-13 rated hokum. The showdowns with Pac-Man and Donkey Kong yield the most suspense, and the special effects look fabulous. The funniest scene occurs when the fictional father of Pac-Man, Professor Iwatani (Denis Akiyama of ""Johnny Mnemonic""), tries to reason with a gargantuan replica of his computer-generated son and it munches his forearm. Columbus appropriated this scene from Howard Hawks' 1951 chiller ""The Thing from Another World."" Not even villainous Peter Dinklage as the diminutive adult version of Eddie can generate any spontaneity in this attractive but anemic laffer. Altogether, ""Pixels"" qualifies as one of Sandler's least memorable movies.","8/10"
"Pixels","wilson-204","26 October 2015","Pixels, based on the 80s arcade games, is an American movie that was just released this year 2015, and its protagonists Brenner (Adam Sandler) and Cooper (Kevin James) and also the presence of Peter Dinklage as Eddie, video game player. It is directed by Chris Columbus, who directed the first film in the Harry Potter saga. The story begins with Brenner missing out on one of the games, years later, he is a repairer of games that he spoke with his friend Cooper childhood, currently the US president, and when he went to work he met Violet who would soon have a relationship intimate. The such pixels, created by the aliens, invading the world and it created them did not like the message received by the US government and who knew it was Ludlow who gave the videotape to Brenner and Cooper and where with the help of own Violet, who is scientist, and her team, create weapons to destroy the pixels and it really is a game that has rules.

It was great from the beginning to the end. The 80's look at the beginning was awesome, I really remembered me as a kid, trying to play those amazing games. The comedy was nice, easy to understand and funny. I would like to see more games but I really enjoyed the movie. Great actors, fresh characters and nice story line, that increased enjoyment until the end.The CGI was great... the pixels effect was awesome too. Without any doubt I think that the movie is the greatest tribute of all times, specially for people like me who grown up playing this games.","3/10"
"Pixels","lsdazrael","25 July 2015","I know Adam Sandler's movies aren't what they used to be, but reading the other reviews, it's as if this is the first slapstick comedy movie any of these people have ever seen. If you're a certain type of person, I guess you just can't get past your rigid thought processes in order to suspend disbelief long enough to watch a movie with a clearly absurd premise. Once you learn that about yourself, you should stop seeing films that are obviously meant to be stupid fun.For those who don't mind a fair bit of tom foolery, this movie is above average. It's not high art, but it has some very funny moments, and hits a lot of the same 1980s nostalgia buttons Adam Sandler movies often press. The film is comparable to Grown Ups, but for the crowd who played video games before they were cool.I liked it, my date (who is quite a bit younger and never played video games) liked it. It was a pretty inoffensive film with lots of stupid humor. Again, it's nothing special, but if you turn off your brain it makes for a fun time.It's certainly neither a 1-star movie nor a 10-star movie. In fact, I rarely trust people who rate films in absolute terms. I've seen very few perfect movies and even fewer that were total garbage, but I've seen thousands of films in that 3-8 range.","2/10"

"Pixels","rcolgan","8 August 2015","Video games really don't have a good reputation when it comes to having film adaptations. Sure we have a few good one's like Wreck it Wralph or Scott Pilgrim, but for the most part they seem to go down the same route as the Super Mario Bros movie where the film loses all the charm that made the game enjoyable to begin with. Part of the reason for this is they always seem to be put into dreadful hands. This time those dreadful hands are Happy Madison Productions, Sandler's film studio that have been producing his cinematic turds for 15 years now. And once again they have produced another insulting comedy, lacking any real charm and being light on laughs.The plot unfolds because back in the 80's NASA sent several video games in to space to communicate to extraterrestrials. But their message of peace was misinterpreted as a declaration of war and the aliens send several video game characters to attack the earth. Thus President Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood friend and gaming champion Brenner (Adam Sandler) to fight off the alien invasion.Right away we've really got to suspend disbelief to accept the plot. Not just because of having to accept the poorly explained justification of why the aliens are attacking as video games, but also buying Kevin James as president of the USA. It's never explained how he became President, but unless Donald Trump was the only other candidate there's no way he could've gotten voted into the position. Especially considering he plays the same annoying character he always does of the dumb guy who does nothing but hang out with Adam Sandlers character. None of the other characters are much better. Sandler has as much charisma as a plank of wood. Josh Gad's performance as the nerdy friend is annoying from the start. The only one who gets even a chuckle is Dinklage as the over the top douchey rival, but even that gets worn out quickly. Also just like all Sandler productions we get a lot of offensive stereotypes. This time the focus is on geek stereotypes, like gamers are antisocial weirdo's who have no lives and live in their mothers basement. Albeit this isn't the most offensive stereotype, but it's still insulting one of the film's biggest audiences. Besides this there are other typical offensive representations we see in all Sandler movies, like women being nothing more than eye candy. In fact there are only two female characters in lead roles. The first is Michelle Monaghan who's in the film only to give Sandlers character somebody to flirt with. The other is Ashley Benson who plays one of the video game characters who comes to life, who not only doesn't get a single line of dialogue in the film but also ends up being a literal trophy for one of the characters. Having some of gaming's most recognisable icons, you'd really think the film would actually do something good with them. But it doesn't. The gaming characters will just attack Sandler and co. only for the humans to fight back and that's it. It never tries to actually make any jokes with these characters, but instead does the same thing as a film like Disaster Movie where it will try to get a laugh by just naming something popular. The only video game icon they do anything else with is Q*bert, who is one of their trophies to help them. But all they have him do is typical annoying Sandler humour like watching Q*bert wet himself with pixels and some weak slapstick.Although at least the gaming icons they use actually look good. It's not like the Mario Bro's Movie where Goomba's looked like a pear on the body of Frankenstein and instead the 3d CGI models maintain the charm of the original designs. But to me this makes the film even worse than typical Sandler comedies because it ends up feeling like such wasted potential. Had a better production been given the chance to use these characters, we might have got a charming homage to video games. But instead we got a typical Sandler comedy, just as unfunny as always but with a bigger effects budget.","1/10"
"Pixels","hhg2","2 October 2015","I was unclear about the intended audience. Was it for kids, who have never seen arcade games and would find them dull and antiquated? Was it for nostalgic adults, who find modern games hyper-violent and gory? I can't imagine either of those groups finding much of value in this movie. Since there was no effort at plot development, endearing or believable characters, or passable dialogue, I would have to vote for this as a ""kids"" movie. But, would if have been difficult to have at least *one* plot element consistent or plausible. Whether for kids or not, the acting was almost horrible beyond measure. The support acting crew does well, but Sandler can barely be bothered with the effort. He literally could have phoned in his lines via cell phone and saved himself or the studio the limousine fees.Why not a single star rating? I give it one above minimum for the graphics. Whether intentional or not, I believe they captured the old graphics' style in the 3-D modernization.","8/10"
"Pixels","michaelberanek275","23 April 2023","I think the passage of time will only but see this movie increase in public estimation. It's bright-eyed warm electo-nostalgic vibe will vaporise the smudgy marks left by the critics that almost universally panned it at its birth. First of all I find Sandler's essential charm unfaded here, just mellowed somewhat, and note he's playing the part of a parody of his character anyway. You'd have to be very unkind not to realise there's something of an interesting satire on early videogame and nerd culture here, mixed into this ambitious work, that is more than a little tongue-in-cheek from start to finish about itself. Perhaps when it came out it was just a little too soon from the early eighties to develop a nostalgic yearning for the subject matter that now feels self evident viewing it couple of decades or more on. The interesting mixture of blocky CG graphics & countless cuboid physical props on the other hand seems almost timeless, perfectly credible, and appropriate to the low-res monitor milieu, and visually it doesn't even seem especially dated. It's a great package, a dizzy pot purri of busy action, funny dialogue and effective acting. One has to admit to the rather formulaic plot, but it does nevertheless serve to anchor the manic energy down enough to give the film a firm, reassuring positive story arc that overall serves to cater for a pretty wide demographic, then, and now, and indeed long may Pixels entertain the whole family for future generations too.","7/10"
"Pixels","peickelberg","31 July 2015","Disappointingly bad movie.The CGI is kind of cool, but the performances are flat, the comedic timing is off, and Sandler just doesn't seem to be making an effort at all(although this may just be his style). In fact, I'm sure that part of the dialogue was either a first-take or else ad lib. How do you get Sean Bean, Adam Sandler, and a few other well-known actors to participate in something so lazy? They could have used a studio audience or a laugh track.I think I know where this movie came from. Someone decided to market a nostalgia film (1980s arcade games) to fathers who have boys aged 12-14. The humor is not sophisticated enough for a normally developed adult intellect, but it also is not appropriate for small children with all the adult themes. It doesn't work. I felt icky watching it.There are a number of 10-star reviews on here. Could the studio have hired people to write them?","10/10"

Decades later the video clips are intercepted and misunderstood to be a declaration of war. The same competing gamer geeks and nerds of long ago are called on to protect the earth from invading aliens conducting war in the form of ancient arcade games.Special effects are more interesting than most of the stars directed by Chris Columbus: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Peter Dinklage, Brian Cox and Dan Aykroyd.

It was supposed to be ridiculous, boyish, puerile, lame, stupid, hackish, dumb-dumb-dumb-fooly-foolish.Surprise! It's all of that! And it's awesome. How else can you make such an outlandish plot work unless you totally sell it. Kevin James becomes the President of the United States?! Doesn't Mark Cuban have something to say about that?Maybe it was the opening scenes that drew me in, giving me a strong sense of nostalgia for those ancient days when quarters seemed like gold doubloons because you could put them into a machine at an arcade and shoot down invaders from outer space. I immediately remembered the infamous Sluggo's arcade where 14-year-old kids chain smoked, tugging on joysticks and slapping buttons while their mothers went shopping at the mall. I remembered that time when I was four and all the kids at the bowling alley were watching me set the record on Spy Hunter and I peed my pants because I didn't want to stop chasing fame.It was worth it, of course.What is a pixel? It's a cube of energy. And it's a weapon. We don't understand it, but we can harness its entirety and make nerds pew- pew it. ""Let the nerds take over.""Adam Sandler is just fine in the movie. I normally despise his hammy overacting, but he reels himself in when he could clearly be a joker daddy with some of the scenes. And Kevin James isn't annoying, either!The movie is actually filled with some pretty biting satire of modern politics, modern video games, social media, mass media, and conspiracy theorists. As a young man watches the alien invaders destroy the Taj Mahal, he quickly films it with his cell phone and just as quickly decides it would be better if he could be in it so he turns to get a selfie video. Who wouldn't?There's plenty of good cameos, campy references to the pop culture of the 1980s, and a pretty sick burn of One Tree Hill. And we get a nice break from the action at a cocktail party that has a lot of funny moments.I thought Peter Dinklage would be cringe-worthy as a mulleted dork, but he actually garners some sympathy by the end. Brian Cox and Sean Bean give nice over-the-top performances along the way, too.I liked Pixels.","2/10"

"Pixels","Giacomo_De_Bello","29 July 2015","Dull, boring, stupid, unfunny and worst of all offensive. This movie made me angry at how bad it was and it is incredible to think it was given to us by the same director of the first two Potter movies, which are by all means, in my opinion, two gems.Pixels is the nail in the coffin for any redemption Adam Sandler could have possibly had at this point in his career. I mean, I get it when you're not caring with your stupid hang out movies like Grown Ups, where the whole point is for you to have a paid vacation with your friends, but this? You manage to screw up a film that has this potential? How the hell do you do that?! Characters that are boring, underdeveloped, uninteresting thrown into situations that are clichéd to the point of exhaustion. The whole set up was probably directed by a machine. The further it goes on the further the characters get boring and so does everything around them. There were clue moments in this movie of action that should have been the climax moment were I was close to falling asleep. I cannot stress it enough: this film is BORING! Yet it gets worse: it isn't even funny! I laughed exactly zero times, maybe, maybe I smiled twice. The lengths to which the jokes are stupid, unremarkable, disgustingly delivered is baffling. I am not stupid Adam you know mother effer! I want to be treated nicely and respected when I go to the theater, instead you serve me with insults to my intelligence and a performance that is the pinnacle of you cashing it in. The script is a lazy mess probably put together in a weekend and is more misogynistic than some 40s movies, wow you truly found a way for people to hate you guys! Fortunately, for the love of god, the film has Peter Dinklage in a few scenes where he shows great comedic timing. Moreover Cubert steals any show that there ever was to steal and is legitimately a good part of the film. Finally, as much as I was about to collapse sleeping once every five minutes, the visual effects kept coming back and keeping me awake, because even if they weren't interesting in the story, they did stand out as truly amazing special effects, some of the best I've seen recently and there wasn't a single time I could make them out to be CGI.That isn't enough to save a disaster of a film, if you were on the edge of deciding whether to see this or not I'l tell you: don't go give your money to Sandler he doesn't deserve it, nor does Sony and their recent line of work of which everything wrong with shines here.","7/10"

"Pixels","Prismark10","16 October 2015","I guess I am in the right age group for Pixels. I played the games featured in this movie in the arcades in my youth. Pixels should had been a lot of nostalgic fun but the Sandler formula is getting old now and I am amazed that there are some 1980s songs still left that have never featured in Sandler's previous films.Adam Sandler plays a whizz-kid arcade games player who in his younger days came second in the world arcade championship, footage of which was sent to space.Now years later an alien planet interpret the footage as an aggressive act and sent sprite like arcade characters to earth to attack it. So you have Pacman on the rampage, Centipede all over London, Donkey Kong is still on the lookout for a plumber.It is up to grown up arcade aces from the old days such as Sandler, his best friend Kevin James, incidentally also the President of the USA, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage to battle these space invaders. Michelle Monaghan plays the love interest. Sean Bean and Brian Cox are the military types who never mastered Commando.Once the film has the big arcade showdown during the climax of the film, its a lot of fun. Q*Bert pops up to give Minion type of support to keep the smaller kids happy.The problem is the film takes too long to get going, the romance angle between Monaghan and Sandler is predictable. The film is actually not funny and there are a lot of problems with it. Why does the Japanese creator of Pacman gets his arm taken off for showing love to his creation but Gad gets to get his Lady Lisa to drop her swords? It looks like they dig dug themselves in a hole.There are a few star cameos which tends to be par to the course in Sandler films but he is a star whose creativity has been on the wane for some time now. It certainly is no can Mr Do.","5/10"
"Pixels","simonpcpearson","7 August 2015","This is just an incredibly lazy film. No-one involved with it seems to care about it, so why should I?The script is based on a short film ( although the animated series Futurama came up with this idea many years earlier) but the attempt to turn the short into a feature failed as soon as Adam Sandler was involved.Sandler appears to make zero effort in this flick. He looks bored, almost sedated. When scenes require complex visual effects Sandler merely goes through the motions, with a "" they'll fix this in post"" expression on his face. It just feels like he wants to get back to his trailer and go back to sleep.kevin James is in this, playing the US President! If that piece of casting alone doesn't tell you what a lazy, lowest common denominator money grab this is, then I don't know what will.The use of 80s video games is a cynical attempt to cash in on nostalgia. Sad to see Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean in this.","5/10"
"Pixels","subxerogravity","25 July 2015","As a kid from the 80s who remembers playing Pac-Man and Donkey Kong on a coin-up, I thought it was a fantastic concept for a movie, but it was put together so horribly.Adam Sandler gets to live out a fantasy of most gamers. In a similar plot to the Last Star Fighter, the main character Sam, after being nothing else but good at video games all his miserable life, somehow becomes the only man on Earth with the skill to defeat an alien invasion in the form of arcade classics (If the alien invasion was in the form of Sonic the Hedgehog, best believe I'm your guy).That sounds like a good idea, but let's face it, it's been a long time since Sandler's Joe Schmo routine has been that appealing. I'm sure he had fun on the set playing out a full scale level of Donkey Kong, but it was not fun to watch at all. I will say the best video game reenactment in the film was when they went up against Pac Man, that was cool, but all the other pixel battles just looked lame.Sandler's good at surrounding himself with friends he likes to work with, like the charming Kevin James who I loved as the U.S President and best friend to Sam. Peter Dinklage was also hilarious as Billy Mitchell another middle age man who reached his peak after becoming Donkey Kong champ.I think I feel most sorry for Chris Columbus, he's a pretty good director but he could not turn the short film this is based on (and I'm sure is far better) into something worth sitting through.The movie was good for a few chuckles and it was cool seeing some of my favorite old school game ions back in 8-bit form, but the movie falls to the rock bottom of being anything at all. Game over.","7/10"
"Pixels","Vivekmaru45","24 September 2015","A formulaic hero saves the day film. The film pays homage to the 80's era of 2D pixel video games, notable Pacman and Centipede. Adam Sandler plays Brenner, a man who can see the ""pattern"" in these old arcade machines and beat them. He has a nemesis in Eddie Plant(Peter Dinklage) who beats him in the Arcade Game World Championship winning first prize.Plot: In the summer of 1982, Sam Brenner and Will Cooper are thirteen-year-olds who love playing in the local arcade. Brenner enters an arcade game world championships. At the event, the MC tells that a time capsule will be launched into space containing a videocassette that includes scenes from the championships.In the present, Brenner works for a company that installs home theater systems and Cooper is the President of the United States. In Guam, a U.S. military base is attacked. The soldiers try to fight back, but are easily defeated, and one soldier is abducted.Brenner is sent to work at the home of Violet Van Patten, a divorcée who lives with her son Matty. Brenner heads to the White House after receiving a call from Cooper. To his surprise, he finds out that Violet is a Lieutenant Colonel. Cooper brings Brenner into the Oval Office to show him the attack in the base. Brenner says that the way the attack was carried out was like in the classic version of the video game Galaga.Later, Brenner drives home when Ludlow suddenly appears inside his van. Ludlow takes Brenner to his home where he says that the aliens are sending creatures with classic video game designs to attack. Ludlow found a message using manipulated footage to explain their plans: The tape was found and seen as a threat; they are using the video games as a challenge. If they win three rounds, they will claim the Earth.Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: An enjoyable time-pass film which has some great C.G.I. effects. The action sequences are the highlight of the film. There are some veteran actors in the film: Brian Cox who plays Admiral Porter, Sean Bean as British Corporal Hill and Japanese actor Denis Akiyama who plays Toru Iwatani, the creator of Pac-Man. Dan Ackroyd makes a cameo appearance as the Arcade Game World Championship M.C.Kevin James, star of sitcom The King of Queens plays William Cooper, the President of the United States. Josh Gad gives an excellent performance as Ludlow Lamonsoff, a conspiracy-theory-obsessed, genius with poor social skills.Directed by veteran director Chris Columbus who is known for directing such movies as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), Home Alone (1990) and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) and for writing movies such as Gremlins (1984) and The Goonies (1985).Adam Sandler is not a great favorite of mine, but his acting is bearable here. He sticks to the lines given to him and does not overdo the sarcasm he is known for. Complementing him is Kevin James who gives a reserved performance. In every Adam Sandler movie, there's a hot chick opposite him. In this one it's Michelle Monaghan who plays a divorcée single mom Violet van Patten. Violet also works for military as a weapons developer. Ashley Benson is cast as eye candy in the role of Lady Lisa, a beautiful warrior from the fictional 1982 video game Dojo Quest.Overall the film cannot be considered a work of serious film-making. It will appeal to casual film goers.More ""Hero Saves The Day Films"": Superman(1978), Commando(1985), Die Hard(1988), Army of Darkness(1992), Last Action Hero(1993).List of arcade video games: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arcade_video_gamesThank you for taking the time to read my review.

I purchased 10 and was going to get those two free ones come hell or high water.I fall into that perfect age group where I would spend the weekend at the video arcade playing the games highlighted in this movie so I figured there was a chance that I would like this one. I don't quite get all the hate directed at this movie, it's obviously intended to me mindless entertainment where you enjoy a hearty laugh.Don't over think it, if you're middle aged, grab a soda and bowl of popcorn, maybe even snag the kids if you can pull them away from the PlayStation or Xbox and share some laughs.","5/10"
"Pixels","Spartan_1_1_7","20 October 2015","Aliens attack the earth, but this time their weapons of choice are classic retro games characters.The movie stars Adam Sandler, Peter Dinklage and Kevin James along with tons of other known actors and some high profile cameos. But aside from maybe Peter Dinklage, none of them worked. Lazy acting or over the top. Also, I really don't get what was the point of adding the LAME ASS romance in this movie. It was so cringe worthy and waste of time. Michelle Monaghan was just there to look pretty.The special effects, all the retro characters brought to life, were pretty good. The pix-elation effects looked nice. Also, there were some, very few, scenes which actually were fun. Like defeating donkey Kong while 'We will rock you' is being played. Now this is the kinda stuff the movie should have focused on.Other than that, the movie was just filled with mediocrity. The jokes never worked, the situations never worked and had so much cringe worthy stuff, and the cheese level was through the roof.Man, I was so looking forward to watching this movie. It had the potential to be so much fun and be really successful. It could have easily tapped the nostalgic centers of millions of gamers who were around when games like Pac Man, Donkey Kong, Mario etc were the big thing. And it had a relatively high budget. I just can't believe how they f***** it up. SUCH A WASTE!!5/10","7/10"
"Pixels","ironhorse_iv","1 August 2015","In the film, NASA launches a time capsule into outer space in the hope of making peaceful First Contact with alien life in 1982. Included in the capsule is a representative cross-section of Earthly delights from the era, including a number of classic arcade games. Unfortunately, the aliens interpret the arcade games as a declaration of war, and decide to attack earth, using various video game characters as weapons. While, its sounds like a cool concept, sadly, this movie is not worth your quarters. This brainless video game movie killed me. Good thing, I have two more lives, left. Don't get me wrong, the movie directed by Chris Columbus, had some entertaining moments, but unfortunately, the negatives about the film, outlive the positives. Based on the 2010 short film of the same name by Patrick Jean. Pixels has an story that sounds suspiciously like a rip-off of a sequence from Futurama's 2002's Season 4, Episode 3 ""Anthology of Interest II"" in which the Earth was invade by aliens, cloak as old school classic video game characters. I wonder if the writers of Futurama, ever sued them for plagiarism claims. Anyways, the visual effects are by far, the best thing in the film, but part of the reason the movie is off-putting to some video games fans, is because the movie barely did any research on the games, in which the character came from. A good example of this, was Pac-Man & Donkey Kong. Not only did, they screw up the gameplay, by not having a kill screen. They also establish a major plot point that wasn't in the original games, which is cheat codes. It's made worse by the fact that the film never explains, how these cheat codes were able to be use, during the real live battles. Plus, I really doubt, four color-coded Mini Coopers offered as ghost analogues could defeat a giant Pac-Man. Technically; they still wasn't ghosts, but I was willing to suspension my disbelief to try to enjoy the film. One thing, that really bug me, was Q*bert. Why in the earth, did the writers allow Q*bert to talk? Wouldn't he, be cursing, if he did? Geesit's like they didn't do any research!? They made it, worst, by turning Q*bert into a female love interest, during the film. I didn't think, that the movie would go so low, to make a 1980s retro-gamer's wet dream, into reality. That's pretty mess up. With that say, some of the 1980s references, don't make any sense, within its timeline. If the time capsule was sent in 1982, how were the aliens, able to make video games characters from later games, like 1985's Tetris or 1984's Duck Hunt or gain access to later video clips of 1980's celebrities. While, this might seem like nitpicking, the movie is so full of anachronisms like these! It's too jarring, not to ignored. Honestly, the movie would had, been more enjoyable, if the acting was a little better. The presence of Adam Sandler as the lead, former arcade champion Sam Brenner was not good. He looks tired and out of it. Sandler in particular comes off downright bored, even during the film's action scenes. He didn't have any heart. His character was very generic for Sandler. Per usual, Sandler plays an immature man/boy who treat women like crap. He was very unlikable. Kevin James as US President William Cooper was a little better. While, he's totally unbelievable as the president, it's nice to see him, not in annoying role. Sadly, that role was given to Josh Gad as Ludlow Lamonsoff, an anti-social conspiracy theorist nut. Every time, he was on screen, his character kill any enjoyment. His character, has garnered so much hate, due to his constant screaming. His creepy sexual tendencies toward everybody, just make it even worse. Peter Dinklage's character, Eddie Plant is usually considered the highlight of the movie, thanks to his actor putting effort into his performance. I love how Peter Dinklage's character looks very similar to Donkey Kong high score record holder Billy Mitchell from 2007's The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, documentary. I wonder if Billy Mitchell, ever sued them for his likeness. Anyways, I really hate the film, for the nerd stereotypes. It's very insulting, for a film to make fun of their target audience. If you're a female. You probably hate this movie, more for their tiresome female stereotypes. Characters like Col. Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) & First Lady Jane Cooper (Jane Krakowski) are high ranking, successful women, but they're often portray as a train-wreck, codependent, women whom only purpose in the film, to fall in love with the male main characters. Violet, alone, often get degraded by names by Sam, to the point, that I really didn't see, much chemistry between them. Even Ludlow's childhood crush, the kick-ass, but silent, Lady Lisa (played by Ashley Benson), is just there to be, literal ""trophy"" wife. It's really sucks to be female in this movie. The film is full of a lot of unsubtly unfunny raunchy sex jokes that wasn't well-receive. The movie has some toilet humor, but thank goodness, nothing too gross. Still, the family-Unfriendly Death scenes, mild swearing and various other inappropriate stuff, didn't stop, this film getting a PG-13 rated. The movie got a lot of publicity with child, but I doubt they will get any of the 1980's references. I did like all the 1980's pop culture references, including the wicked 1980's style, soundtrack that played, throughout the film. Another thing that I love, is the celebrity cameos. It's cool to see them, here. The ending is pretty predictable. I'm surprised, they didn't go with the dark gritty ending of the short film. That would have been interesting. Anyways, the post-credits scene is disturbing, enough. Overall: I'm sorry, but I'll not insert any more coins to rewatch this lazy, creatively-bankrupt movie. That's it! It's Game Over, man! Game Over! Watch Disney 2012's Wreck it Ralph, instead!","5/10"

You watch, and you accept it for what it is. Sandler is Sandler, and I enjoy his humor. For some reason, the critics have turned on him in a bad way and I don't know why. But I suppose his type of humor is for the young and he's a middle aged man now and maybe should have turned to more serious roles? That's at least what I think is bugging these folks.

"Pixels","ufster-2","5 March 2016","It's a good enough movie to waste some otherwise would be empty hours but the buck stops there. The delicious irony of it is that the protagonist of the movie is someone who feels they can only deliver worthy performances when they play video games that have predictable patterns, you know, just like movies with Adam Sandler starring in them. It's as if they throw darts at a rotating board filled with random words stickied on to it, just to see what it lands on so they can come up with these movies. Sandler throws first, dart lands on nerd, he plays the nerd. Sandler buddy number one throws second, dart lands on president, he plays the president. Sandler buddy number two throws last, dart lands on conspiracy theorist loner, he plays the conspiracy theorist loner.Just don't forget to throw in a delightfully cute piece of romantic interest in the mix (Monaghan) so that our nerdy hero gets his trophy at the end of the movie, since any flick that panders to nerds has to have some type of fan service add the chick with swords, long legs and cleavage and voila... you have one more forgettable movie on your Netflix catalogue.","4/10"
"Pixels","jperez1107","23 July 2015","I've learned to take in movies in context. It has made my movie-going experience more enjoyable and has made me a more appealing companion with whom to watch movies. Likewise, I adjust my rating scale based on a number of factors including genre, intended audience and self awareness.Pixels is a thoroughly enjoyable movie if you take it for what it is: a light-hearted sci- fi comedy that aims to please without being too self-conscious. At times funny, at times sweet, and always entertaining, Pixels manages to take viewers through a nostalgic ride that is well-paced and doesn't suffer from the seemingly never-ending (and often less funny) third act that is characteristic of this kind of movie.Most of the laughs come from Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage, who look very comfortable in their portrayals as quirky conspiracy theorist Ludlow and former video game master Eddie, respectively. Adam Sandler's character seems all too familiar considering the actor's recent string of movies so I won't expand on that, and Kevin James plays Cooper as you'd come to expect from Kevin James. Rounding out our cast of heroes is Michelle Monaghan as Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten, a great addition who may feel out of place in a scene or two, like when her very believable concern for the situation at hand stands in stark contrast with the farcical dialogue.The special effects in Pixels are top-notch, creating a world where you can't help but suspend your disbelief and become engrossed in the action. The references to popular arcade video games are sure to remind audience members who grew up playing them of a simpler time.In all honesty, I didn't expect much coming into this movie, so suffice it to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't pay to see it twice, but I'd be sure to tune in if I ever come across it on Netflix or TV; heck I will probably spare the $2.00 at Red Box when it's released on BlueRay.","5/10"
"Pixels","tinovalkki","10 August 2015","If you want to see this movie, don't expect much of it. Movies humor is stale and predictable. Not even nostalgia effect offers you much. Biggest problem of this project is it's target audience. Movie is clearly targeted to younger audience, which hardly gets interested thirty year old video games. For adult audience story is just too lame even with it's try of nostalgic memories. Of course if you choose to go to watch this movie you perhaps wont even expect much of it. It is worth to think to watch this movie at your own home theatre. Script is lame and humor won't make you even laugh a bit. Characters are lame and uninteresting even they try to tell you something about blended families. It makes me wonder if Hollywood studios are so stupid to think that they can release this kind of crap and even make some money out of it. How stupid they think that movie audience is today? This could be perfect family entertainment as straight to DVD format and digital release, but it is not worth of movie release.","1/10"

I am twelve and I was not put of by the rude language despite the film being a 12A. It has a great balance of action, romance, jokes and suspense. I thought the animation and graphics were incredible, they really brought the video game characters to life however in some scenes I found it difficult to tell what the attackers were (but that is probably because I am 12) that said I knew what the three main Video games featured were so it didn't ruin the experience at all, only left me curious after the movie. All that said I can actually sum up this move in one sentence, incredibly clever movie filled with action and suspense, couldn't wait to watch it and I wasn't at all disappointed.","9/10"
"Pixels","gspencley","26 September 2015","So many people seemed determined to hate this movie before it was even released. I think it was mostly those who dislike Adam Sandler. Both the hate towards this movie and towards Adam Sandler are undeserved. Sandler has made some flops (Little Nicky, Jack & Jill), but he was also responsible for some comedy classics (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer) and has shown that he's capable of more serious roles as well (Spanglish, Funny People). As far as Adam Sandler in this movie goes, it falls somewhere in the middle. Far removed from either his worst or his best roles. He wasn't the primary reason I enjoyed the movie, but he took nothing away from my enjoyment either. And perhaps that's how it should be. I don't remember feeling like I was being reminded that I was watching an Adam Sandler flick.We all know this movie was not intended as fine art and it's almost cliché to point that out when reviewing light-hearted comedies. The point is, I had a good time watching. The short Internet clip that inspired this movie was incredible, and seeing the idea expanded on was good fun. It won't change your life, but it will transport you back to 80s and give you some fun eye candy. One thing of note: I usually get to bored by long, drawn-out CGI action sequences, especially during climaxes. This is the first movie in a long time that had such a sequence during the climax that actually entertained me, and I think that means a lot. For me the movie would have been better had it's intended audience been adults. Some of the attempts at ""double entendre"" humour (i.e: jokes intended to entertain the adults yet be ""safe"" for kids) fell flat for me. But I understand that they wanted to make a family friendly movie, and that's what they did. Peter Dinklage was comedy gold. If you like video games and Game of Thrones it's worth seeing just for those two things alone.","7/10"

"Pixels","the_devil_is_hagey","17 August 2015","Before we walked into the Cinema, I had thought that this could either be the longest almost two hours ever, or that it would be incredibly funny.Let's face it, that sums up most Adam Sandler films... with Little Nicky, Mr Deeds and Anger Management being huge classics, and other films like Click doing a little worse... I had proof to back up that statement.I'll be the first to admit that I am quite a big geek. Having grown up in the tail end of this generation of gaming, I can remember all the games that were included in the film - admittedly I played them from the comfort of mine or my friends living room rather then the Arcades. This film had big bridges to cross....I am happy to say this film caught me off guard. Firstly, the soundtrack. A good soundtrack can make or break a film, and I thought the mix of 1970s/1980s music fitted perfectly with the feel of the film. Hearing hits from Queen and Spandau Ballet whilst watching classic games tear up the modern world seemed like a nice form of justice from the games forgotten by the modern day gamer.The storyline is a little slow and predictable in parts but the funny parts manage to over balance this. Having a linear storyline is also a safe bet, rather then risking the dangerous territory of the flashback. Starting off in 1982 and showing the two main characters developing there skills and the relationships. The directors managed to create the feel of era well, and the cameo appearance Dan Aykroyd as the championship made me chuckle, bearing in mind one of the biggest films of the 1980s was Ghostbusters.Moving onto the modern day and with the slightly interesting twist of the loser best friend being President of the United States allowed for some different comedy opportunities, including attitudes towards the Navy Seals or Secret Service. Admitedly, there are some jokes which meet all the stereotypes of cross Atlantic relations that were a little tedious, but the American self-ripping far outweighed this.The cameo appearance from Sean Bean playing an Officer in the British Army again worked well from his Sharpe days, and I will be the first to admit that I expected him to be pixel-lated faster then you can shout ""watch out Sean, it's behind you.""Overall, the plot worked well although it was a little slow in parts. Also I felt the end was a little abrupt and rushed. Taking the five or ten extra minutes to round off the story better would have certainly been money well spent.The CGI was, in my opinion, perfect. Creating a clunky version of Packman whilst also getting it to destroy New York with a realistic effect could be very difficult... too far and you'd end up with a misplaced damage sequence from Avengers or Transformers, too pixey and the film would have been stale and flat. The film managed to keep the feeling of the gaming generation well, and the CGI deserves a well earned pat on the back.The only major negative point is that some of the key scenes were in the trailer. The script was already predictable in parts but, as with most big films, too much was given away on the small screen.All in all, a good all round film that is certainly worth a watch, especially for those who like the classic, simpler world of original gaming. Now where did I leave my Atari or Sega Megadrive?Score Plot - 3 out of 5 CGI - 4.5 out of 5 Soundtrack - 4 out of 5 Overall Enjoyment - 4 out of 5","10/10"
"Pixels","stephendaxter","27 September 2015","Pixels, a film that when i first heard of it i thought had a really great premise, seriously, classic video-games coming down to attack earth and the only way to defeat them is by playing by the rules of the game. On paper that sounds like a very fun and entertaining time, but then you add Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and a boring story and you get this barely watchable garbage with very few redeemable qualities. My main hope for this film was that Adam Sandler would not be playing a dumb character who speaks with stupid voices, yells, tells shitty jokes and that he would just play a more laid back character who can still be funny on occasion. But although he isn't as bad as he has been in recent years he is still the low point of this film and drags it down, like, a lot. I don't think i need to spell it out for you that Sandler has had a serious problem finding a good film since 2006's 'Click'. So i really shouldn't be surprised at the fact that this isn't a return to form, but Sandler at his best is hilarious so i will keep hoping that one day we will get a good Sandler comedy, unfortunately, this is far from it.Now, the story in this film is just so dumb and cheesy and really doesn't have much substance to it at all. The film is literally a few video-game battles scattered throughout with a whole bunch of side-plots and jokes in-between. But when literally 95% of those side-plots are crap and you don't care about them it makes those scenes drag on and on. You have the obligatory romance that totally does not fit into the film at all and is a bunch of forced, completely out of place pile of crap that offers nothing more that cheap running jokes and filler to add to that run-time. Seriously, not a major plot spoiler here but be warned, (all in the first 20 minutes or so) a kid calls Sandler to install a T.V then he meets the kids mother, recently divorced, they talk, and then she happens to be a DARPA agent going to the same place as Sandler and then happens to for some reason be the person assigned to work closely with Sandler for the remainder of the movie. Did they even try? Some of the characters/performances were OK at best, Peter Dinklage wasn't great but he was kinda bearable, Josh Gad was probably the best in the film and that isn't saying much. But the scenes with them at least kept me awake, if i had to sit there watching Sandler and Kevin James the whole time i'd have zoned out really quickly. Sorry, did i say Kevin James? I meant PRESIDENT Kevin James...... whose dumb-ass idea was that, imagine a world where Paul Blart is the president, yeh, i know it's dumb. When was the last time Kevin James was actually funny, i can't watch this guy anymore and he is heading down the same track as Sandler, if he isn't there already. His character served no purpose other than crappy jokes and an excuse to have Sandler's character at every place at the right time. And they even dragged Brian Cox and Sean Bean into this film, why they agreed i will never know. So, what did i like? I actually found the video-game battles to be somewhat enjoyable, some more than others. Just seeing these old arcade games come to life in a 3D world actually was quite cool it looked good visually and were the highlights of the film. Sandler didn't bother me much in those scenes because the focus was taken off him for a moment, of course, if you took him out of the scene it still would have been better. Especially the last 10-15 minutes i enjoyed quite a bit, i won't spoil it but it was just fun to watch and got me to laugh for the first and only time. So, in the end, i guess this is a good film for kids who will laugh at anything, and for those people who find Sandler still funny, whoever who are. But if you are looking for a good video- game based film, just watch Wreck-It-Ralph and you won't be disappointed. I would have maybe pushed this film to nearly a 5 but they had to keep that goddamn piece of **** absolutely ******* dumb scene in there with Toru Iwatani so it loses a point. - 4/10","7/10"

And Josh Gad is fat, loud, ugly and as annoying as hell. Still there are good things here. It does move quickly; guest stars Sean Bean, Serena Williams and Jane Krakowski are amusing; James and Monaghan are great in their roles and there are some great 80s songs on the soundtrack. But the main reason to see the film is the video games graphics. They look GREAT and the battle scenes are lots of fun. Best of all is an all out attack at the end by the aliens where virtually every 80s video game character makes an appearance. It's worth seeing just once for that alone. Otherwise it's pretty stupid and pointless.","1/10"
"Pixels","jkern11","28 July 2015","Nostalgic, but not how you think. I really wanted to like this movie. I actually want to like all Adam Sandler movies. But lately he is making that almost impossible. Even with a decent buzz I couldn't get into this movie. Action scenes just were okay, but the jokes were so bad and forced they didn't land. I'm getting tired of Sandlers ultimate cool guy complex he seems to play in every move lately. Even as a nerd he comes off super cocky. The only nostalgia that this movie gave me wasn't for the 1980's rather it was for the 1990's when Adam Sandler movies were still good. I hope his next movie he uses the reset button and goes back to his roots.","10/10"
"Pixels","jasonbrianhall","27 July 2015","Ignore the negative reviews. Pixels is an awesome movie. If you were an eighties arcade gamer, you'll love all the nostalgia. I let my children play all the old arcade games before they saw the movie (except centipede) and they were so excited to see all there heroes in a live action movie. I took my six year old to the movie and she's still talking about it. My three year old was good most of the movie where there were live-action sequences with Pac-man and stuff (which was about half the movie) and couldn't take his eyes off the scree but got bored during talking scenes. I went into the movie expecting an Adam Sandler Movie. I came out satisfied and laughing move of the movie. Don't go in with Super High Expectations that there will be this glamorous storyline and you won't leave disappointed.","10/10"

"Pixels","TheMovieDiorama","3 July 2019","As a video gamer myself, my childhood was in the midst of this iconic cultural movement. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Galaga, Donkey Kong and of course Tetris. So for a film to use these legendary titles, well, the nostalgia should've instantly won me over. But wait! What's this? Happy Madison Productions is involved? The same writer as 'Grown Ups 2'? Urgh. And this is why we can't have nice things in life. An extraterrestrial race misinterpret video games as a declaration of war (oh, a time capsule of a championship was sent out to space for no apparent reason), to which they mimic the characters within the games and send them down to destroy Earth.A planet hosting an array of powerful nations with the capacity to decimate cities with the click of a button. But you see, the army just can't get to grips with the pattern of Centipede or Arkanoid. They Just aren't trained enough in arcade gaming! So naturally the army recruit a former Pac-Man champion, his video-gaming nemesis, a random conspiracy theorist and the President of the frickin' United States. I do not want to be in a world where Kevin James is the President and Adam Sandler stops an alien invasion. Nope! Anyway, as you would expect from the onslaught of recent films that Sandler's studio pump out every year, it's bad. Not even an entertaining ""turn your brain off"" kinda way. It's just flat out terrible.Herlihy's writing was incomprehensibly painful to say the least. No character personalities, no bite to the plot and certainly no humour. The story exists to play on the nostalgia of its audience, without actually going anywhere with it. Colombus' direction is bland and predictable right down to the inner code. The cast were just playing themselves, and Sandler happened to drag fine actors into this mess. Monaghan, Shaw, Cox and Bean, come on you fine actors! Just say no next time. Q*Bert has way too much screen time and is, for some unknown reason, physically communicating in English. At one point, a certain character engages in intercourse with their video game crush. And, wait for it, produces five baby Q*Berts. Five of them! Nope. I'm done. Why the hell is Iwatani involved? Why does Max Headroom look worse?Aside from the semi-decent pixelated visual effects and Serena Williams being the queen that she is, Pixels is one glitchy affair that is essentially unplayable.","4/10"

"Pixels","eichler2","29 June 2017","I avoided seeing this movie for two years until it came on free TV, just based on the abysmal reviews when it first came out. To those who trashed it so badly - what were you expecting? It's an Adam Sandler movie, it's not going to be masterpiece theatre.So the premise is ridiculous (aliens create weapons based on 80s arcade games to attack the Earth), the script is silly and at times self-contradictory, some of the humor induces groans rather than laughs and a lot of the acting was over-the-top. OK, maybe I'm seeing where those bad reviews came from...But if, like me, you practically lived in the arcades in the 80s, this movie is just jam-packed with nods and references to games like Centipede, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, Space Invaders, Robotron, Burger Time and others. It was fun just trying to identify which games all the alien attackers came from.My one gripe is that there were some characters that were just made up for the movie. I was scratching my head trying to figure out what game the purple ninjas were from, or where the red dressed warrior lady came from. Turns out they were both invented for the film.Another questionable aspect is why the intellectual level of this movie is clearly aimed at pre-teens. They weren't even born when these games were popular.Overall though, if you're looking for a mindless comedy with well done special effects and tons of 80s video game references, this makes for an entertaining couple hours. Just don't expect an Oscar winning film.","10/10"

If you have any amount of appreciation for your hard earned money you will skip this pile of garbage. Adam Swindler and his crew have figured out that the general American audience will stare at a wall for the sake of staring at a wall. That's what this movie makes you feel like you are doing, just staring at a big empty wall and you are paying to do so. Don't be fooled by these big budget productions of nothing but fart and pee jokes. Be better than this people. Boycott this type of garbage and keep Sandler out of the theater. Chris Columbus is such a great director and his talent was wasted here.","1/10"
"Pixels","Wizard-8","3 November 2015","Normally I can't stand Adam Sandler movies, but I decided to watch this particular one because of its nostalgic factor - 1980s video games, something I was a fan of all those decades ago. Still, I was kind of prepared for the worst. To my surprise, though I didn't think that the movie was successful overall, I had to admit to myself that the movie did have some strong positive attributes. One of them was a pleasant surprise, namely Adam Sandler. Though I have found him abrasive and annoying in other movies, here he is pretty palatable. And actually funny at times. There are a good amount of gags that actually work. It certainly helped that I was an old time gamer and could understand the amusing references to many classic arcade games. And the special effects used to bring these games to life are pretty good, colorful and innovative.But despite good things such as those, I didn't think the movie quite worked in the end. For starters, the opening credits state that the movie was based on a short film. While this story might have worked as a short, it doesn't work at 106 minutes long. The movie is too padded out and repeats itself a bit too much. Also disappointing is that we don't get to see the aliens as they really are, nor do we really get to hear enough from them to make them fleshed out and feel like a real threat. The movie also makes the big mistake of saying that the aliens saw video games from 1982 while showing a number of brought-to-life video games that came out several years later.Despite my feeling that the movie ultimately doesn't make it, my feelings towards it aren't really hostile. I can see some people would like it. I would advise you to read more IMDb user comments for this movie to determine whether in your case you may like it or not.","10/10"
"Pixels","vyamont","26 September 2015","This is a must see movie for all generations , It will appeal to young and old and manages to bridge that gap beautifully. Some people may comment that the acting was lack luster and stale even cheesy, however I believe that was the intent. You'll notice at the starting credits that Sandler's production company ""Happy Maddison"" was used so you can imagine the type of humour. The story was funny uncomplicated but riddled with little innuendos and subtle jokes that will keep Adults laughing.The Idea that a Computer nerd could have a beer and pretzels friendship with the president of the USA cracked me up and I think a lot of people will enjoy the slapstick tongue in cheek humor used In this film.If you like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, here comes the boom. Your sure to love this, and I think even more so when your kids look at you weird because your laughing at something completely above there head.","10/10"

This movie makes fun for everything related to 80's and how we can miss that age and the idea to mix those feelings were really great. I grew up using Arcade Machines (I'm from 90's generation) but I played those video games. I laughed a lot, and the other people at the cinema did it as well.

"Pixels","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","24 February 2016","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As a young boy in the early '80s, Brenner (Adam Sandler) was a whizz-kid at arcade games, at a time when they had just come out and were all the rage. However, after a humiliating defeat to local rival Eddie (Peter Dinklage), he can't see his life going anywhere...and it doesn't, whilst years later his best friend Cooper (Kevin James) has gone and become the president. But Brenner's life might be about to change, after aliens in outer space misinterpret a signal sent from Earth as a declaration of war, and send an army in the shape of the arcade games he was once so good at playing to attack Earth. Brenner now must go from zero to hero, and save the world as only he can.Some films are harder to read than others. Sometimes, it can be difficult to work out whether something was meant to be taken seriously, as a piece of high art, or will end up leaving you to marvel at whether it was just a massive in-joke when you see the abysmal quality of the finished product. In a nutshell, some films were made to win Oscars, and some, while not being meant as bad, were simply made to switch your brain off and have some cheesy, shameless fun. It's safe to say a film about arcade game characters from the '80s being sent from space to attack Earth would fall slap bang in to the aforementioned category, and so anyone who approached Pixels with any sense of Citizen Kane expectations, and slammed it simply for what it is, would only have themselves to blame for not recognising the potential sort of entertainment factor it had. But somehow, it doesn't work even on this level.The revival of '80s nostalgia seems to be pretty high right now, and a lot of popular culture seems to be selling its premise simply on a concept that promotes that. So a film where a host of these former game icons, most notably a giant Pac Man, are among the main characters is a cat in the bag all of its own. Indeed, the film itself has a zany sort of Ghost Busters esque appeal about it, and the hope was that it could match the zany fun of those films. All the right ingredients are there, and it does manage some funny, enjoyable moments. But consistently, despite the affection for its source material, it fails to really be any fun and keep the tone going.Director Chris Colombus litters the most high profile thing he's done in years with a host of big name stars, including Brit actors Brian Cox and Sean Bean in comedic hard man military roles, whilst big name comedy star Sandler vies for comic affection from other established star James. Somehow, none of them can inject this missed opportunity with the spark it needs. **","6/10"

"Pixels","cgrill8","10 August 2015","Pixels was a cute movie with wonderful visuals. Independence Day this is not, so don't go looking for anything serious here... this is a COMEDY! If there's a moment they can interject 80's nostalgia... they're going to do it. And they did with style I have to say.The plot was simple... like an old arcade game... three tries and you're safe. Still not sure how the 'cheating' was done... but when you 'see' the codes... they are all various codes for home games- I think. Saw a glimpse of the Konami code in there too! Trying not to spoil too much. Will say the comedy had me laughing. My little girl got many of the jokes too. The action was pretty cool, and made you just want to jump in a join the silly antics. Now the bad... some of the adult jokes did seem a bit much for a mixed audience, and younger kids. Now, when Dinklage mentioned the 2 girl sandwich... I HAD to laugh when we see the women he wanted to see and... yes, they had a sandwich in hand! The best pun of the WHOLE movie. Yes, one guy ""gets the girl."" But I hate to say, she wasn't a 'girl' to begin with... and it was a lifetime fatuation... it was weird, and even Sandler's character made a funny comment about it too. Some may have object to it... but again, it just bad humor, which was actually funny and is the cause for the follow up scene in the credit. You can NOT take this movie too seriously.Now the REAL bad. Josh Gad... he should NOT have been in this film. When the trailers were shown months ago... my little girl was excited because she KNEW he voiced Olaf... well, Olaf he AIN'T and he makes Sandler's comedy seem classy. He was the wrong age, the wrong comedy, and just all around would have been a better film without the terrible, the lewd, and the wrong: Josh Gad. If he screamed one more time or showed his crack another time... I'd have left the theater.Overall the movie IS enjoyable and plenty of game CGI eye candy for all to see. And that's where the real gems in this movie are. The game characters! Q-Bert actually talks - which took some time to get used to. But Pac Man had some personality, so did Donkey Kong, and some of the others. Many details to take in all at once, is why I actually suggest a second viewing, just for the details alone. Yeah, the plot line is thin, but it's fun. Yeah, they could have blasted the ship out of the sky I guess... but where's the fun in that? It's silly, it's fun, it's a visual treat. Ignore Josh Bad, and enjoy the movie! I might have given it a higher rating had Gad not been in it. And people are complaining about Sandler!? It's better than you think... especially if you know these games, or born in the 1970's and remember all the fads of the 80's.","8/10"

"Pixels","romik-17725","11 February 2016","I think that at some point in his career Adam Sandler lost sight of what his demographic is. Most can agree that his 90's work is pretty good if not great - Waterboy, Billy Madison, Wedding singer. But most of us were kids / teenagers at that point and even now in retrospect while we realize that those films are a tad idiotic, there was still fun to be had. But not anymore.Pixels does not know who it's trying to reach. It has all the retro gaming references that will appeal to the 20-30 year old, but the humor and overall acting that might amuse a 10 year old at best. The casting, oh god where do I even begin. First of all, stop casting beautiful women as Adam Sandlers love interest. I mean come on - Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Salma Hayek, and now Michelle Monaghan? But the worst part - Kevin James as the president. Have you seen Paul Blart Mall Cop? Exact same character. I lost it there.I won't even get into the stupidity of the plot because that would take ages to get through. In the end I'd say that aside from the retro gaming scenes that some might find amusing and spark a hint of nostalgia, there is nothing appealing in this movie. Quite the contrary.","6/10"

"Pixels","russellingreviews","25 August 2015","980's video games are back and they want to destroy the world. Walking into the cinema... I am trying to think of something that makes me want to see this film. Nope, I cannot seem to find anything.Overall Rating: 1 starIn 1982, the world was was enjoying the new arcade games of Pac-Man, Galaga, Centipede and Donkey Kong. Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler) and Will ""Chewy"" Cooper (Kevin James) lived for playing the latest arcade game and finding opportunities to show off their gaming skills. They decide to show off their talents at the World Video Game Championships where they come in contact with Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) and Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant (Peter Dinklage). During the competition they show their knack for seeing patterns in the games and their joy stick dexterity. At the same time in human history, NASA sent off a probe into space to attempt to connect with intelligent life in outer space. In this probe they sent glimpses into the 80's culture of our world which included components of these iconic video games. Fast forward to 2015, the lives of this band of nerdy brothers have gone down different paths. Sam is an installation technician and Will has become the President of the United States. Even though they are still close friends, their life responsibilities carry different levels of significance, until they are drawn back together when aliens attack the earth. The explanation for the attack is that the extra-terrestrials received the 1982 message from NASA and saw it as declaration of war on their planet. Their response to this unintentional call to arms is to send the classic video games to attack earth as pixelated weapons. Sam and Will have to re-connect with their former video game competitors and work with the world armed forces to fight off the nostalgic alien invasion. Similar to the life cycle in the video games, the team is given three attempts by the space invaders to apply their former gaming skills and to discover the answers to saving the world from an Atari- inspired annihilation. Pixels, as a concept, is refreshingly original and has the potential to serve as a digital bridge between multiple generations. The other potential hope for this film is director Chris Columbus at the helm, he has produced some great family films throughout his career. This hope was for Columbus to take this convoluted storyline, which has the potential to go the way of fun and nostalgic hilarity or he could produce a mess of a film with catastrophic proportions, and make a great family comedy. Unfortunately, Pixels falls into the latter category as a mess. Columbus attempts to deliver a 1980's retro style film with ridiculous characters and situations with a modern computer-generated spin, but fails to deliver. This failure has to do with the inclusion of Adam Sandler and Kevin James as the lead characters. At this stage in their acting careers, they seem unable to deliver original comedic performances. Their roles are as predictable as the patterns in the old video games. They walk through their performances in this film with little enthusiasm and with a reliance on dated comedic styles that have worn out their welcome. Josh Gad provides the potential for originality, but he falls into the trap of overacting which attempts to compensate for Sandler and James' weak performances. Also, the only reasonable explanation for Peter Dinklage and Michelle Monaghan being part of this project was to potentially procure a comedy on their resume. Unfortunately, they are poorly cast in parts that any credible actor should have given a miss. If all of these components were not bad enough, the truly frustrating thing about Pixels is not in the weak story line or the poor performances, but the fact that this is promoted as a family film. The humour and innuendo is not funny and is not appropriate for children. The marketing conveys that this film should be accessible for any generation to enjoy on a Saturday afternoon, but what happens is the potential for embarrassing conversations with small children on a multitude of levels. For example, why Eddie Plant is going to the White House's Lincoln bedroom with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams or the stalker-type mentality of the Ludlow character. So much of the film was creepy to experience as an adult, much less trying to explain it to children. This review should not be misconstrued as prudish, but more of holding the marketing team to account for the disservice to families. In the concept stages, Pixels may have had the potential to be a fun adventure for people who grew up in the 80's and potentially for a new generation, too. In the end, it proves to be an embarrassment for those linked to this production and for anyone who might go to see it. Leaving the cinema... Avoid the potential awkward conversations with your children and give Pixels a miss. It is one of the rare films that I would not recommend for any audience. Do not be fooled, it is not funny or a family film. Game Over. Bigger questions: 1. Do we all have a role in this life? (Proverbs 16:9, Romans 8:28) 2. What is the Bible's view on war? (Ecclesiastes 3:8, Matthew 26:52) 3. Why do people still go to Adam Sandler and Kevin James films?

The great thing about this movie is how they got nerds, vintage video games and aliens, put them into a blender and mix this caper, because they pulled it off!!! I find it organic. All these non-related subjects mingle so well everything fits and makes sense.
I've seen this flick a bunch of times and I always have a ball. The cast pulls it off and Dinklage is very funny.
So much fun!!!","7/10"
"Pixels","chunksieentertainment","13 November 2015","Yeah, I don't get the bad reviews either. really liked Pixels. It was not as campy as I thought it would be. I rolled my eyes and sucked my teeth like ten times during the movie at some corny scenes, like when the Josh Gad character tried to kiss Brenner on the lips, or when Serena and Martha Stewart waved Eddie up at the end from the White House window. But it was an easily understandable comedy. Lots of reviews said there was no premise to the story, but there was. Lots of stories from the 80's and 90's were conjured from the idea that the capsule of human info sent from earth to space would be misinterpreted by aliens from space and they would decide to destroy earth. It has been used all the time as punchlines because back in the old days it was the biggest risk when the capsule was first sent to space. I think even a star trek movie was based on the same concept(look it up,not sure about that one). Anyway, it was a good movie.Wouldn't go up for an Oscar, but good for a lot of laughs, I liked it.","1/10"
"Pixels","jonandshellie","31 May 2016","After seeing 'Pixels' several times now thanks to Starz, I can't help but wonder why the movie was panned so badly by critics and fans alike during its theatrical run? It's an enjoyable film with funny characters, tight direction by family film veteran Chris Columbus, a decent script, and good acting by everyone involved. My only guess is that the backlash is due to one factor and one factor only - Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison crew were involved in the project. Not that Sandler was bad in the film, he was as good as he ever was. I think it's more of a bias built on a foundation of bad/sub-par movies that Sandler has released in recent years (i.e. ""Grown Up's 2"", ""Just Go With It"", ""Jack and Jill"", ""That's My Boy"" etc.), but I think that people are letting their resentment of Sandler cloud their judgement on this film which is a delightful family film rooted in a ton of 80's arcade game nostalgia. The film and everyone involved don't deserve that and if people would just ease up on their biases a bit then they'd see that the movie is a fun fantasy romp with likable characters and an interesting premise developed from a French short film of the same name. Sure the story is far-fetched, but it was a fun ride and is a movie that is a great Saturday night flick with the kids. Not to go into too much detail, but the premise of the story is simple - It is 1982 and Sam Brenner (Sandler) is a teenage arcade game whiz who is talked into enter the World Video Game Championships by his friend Will Cooper (James). During the championships, Sam and Will meet another contestant, an eccentric young kid named Ludlow Lamansoff (Gad). In the finals Sam has to face-off with Eddie ""Fireblaster"" Plant (Dinklage), another teenage arcade game whiz. Sam eventually loses to Plant and it haunts him for the rest of his life. In the current day, Sam has grown up to become a Audio/Video installer and Will Cooper has become the President of the United States. After a mysterious attack it is discovered that a video of the 1982 World Championships was sent into outer space on a probe. The probe was intercepted by an alien civilization and the games on the video were misinterpreted as a threat by the aliens who proceed to develop weaponry similar tot he games to battle Earth in winner-take-all battle. Once it is discovered that the aliens are using old arcade games to fight us, President Cooper employs Sam, Ludlow, and Eddie to help use their old-school gamer skills to team up and stave off the attackers. Again, this a fun movie that really ignites old-school arcade/video game nostalgia and does a great job of interweaving old games into the modern time-line of the film. I highly recommend it to anyone.","6/10"
"Pixels","j-lindsay-sens","29 September 2015","So, i skipped the theater, and thankfully so. This movie is not worth the cost (most movies arnt nowadays anyways), but this movie was really not that good. I love Adam, and some of his movies are my favourite all time (water boy, Bed Time stories, Little Nicky), but this movie is not high up on that list for me. The movie of course had its saving moments, and i did laugh quite a bit, and i enjoyed most of it, but overall, the movie was terrible.So the movie plot is: in the 80's, a group of friends loved arcade games, and one of the boys (Adam Sandler) became one of the best in the world, before loosing to Peter Dinklage. At this event, NASA had recorded the arcade games and sent it into space in hopes of communicating with aliens. Fast forward to present times, the friends have all moved on, one became a conspiracy nut, one became the president, and Adam became a software installation specialist. However one day, aliens land on Earth and challenge the humans to an arcade like game, using old arcade games, for the fate of the world and these friends must unit together once again to save Earth.So the pros: I liked the movie, it was very fun, had some good action, extremely good CGI when it came to the video game characters (i thought the centipede was awesome looking),the soundtrack was pretty awesome and combined with the action was very ""pump up"", the jokes were often on que, and the idea of Kevin James as President was beyond hilarious.Cons: The movie lacked any real depth, but it didn't aim to, the dialog between characters was often painful to watch and too corny, the forced love connection with the main characters, the massive amount of plot holesOverall: I liked this movie, it will surely become a cult classic, and it was fun to watch at home on a Sunday night on TV, but i wouldn't recommend buying it. I personally wouldn't reject it as a gift, but i wouldn't go out and buy it myself unless it was $5. From an actually technical movie perspective, it was lousy and deserves a 5. whatever it is, if not less. But don't let that fool you, because if you don't take it seriously, it was a fun movie. As an overall movie, it should be a 5.0, judging it based on what it was made to be, probably an 7.0...so i took the middle ground, and gave it a 6.0","1/10"

Adam Sandler just walks around any room in the White House, no boundaries. This seems like it could of been the entire premise of the movie. Just the president having a loser best friend.But that is the smallest point I want to make. What happened to you Adam?? You use to be so full of life. You would yell. You would punch people. You would laugh. This entire movie was just you waiting for the opportunity to insult someone. And then dragging the bit for too long. Adam Sandler had the same sad tired face the entire movie. Lifeless performance. Stop crapping out all these pointless movies just for the money. Actually put your passion into it. Like you use to.","5/10"

I decided to ignore the poor rating on IMDb and go for it anyway which proved to be a terrible mistake!! So we watched this film for around 1 hour and then all (Me, my girlfriend and our son) of us decided it was a complete waste of 1 hour of our lives (not to mention the £4.50 rental charge!) so had to turn it off. None of the comedy was funny to either us or the child, as the obvious jokes were being cracked on screen we were all looking at each other in disbelief at how cheesy and how much of a lack of effort was put into the writing of this film! Needless to say i will not be recommending this film to anyone, EVER!! I read some reviews on here after watching the film for the 1 hour that we survived and was expecting to find endless 1 star reviews and was so amazed that there was loads of 10 star ratings!!! I can't believe all these people were watching the same films as myself! Usually I do like Adam Sandler films (mainly the older ones).","1/10"

Sure the premise is a little ludicrous and sure Kevin James as the President of the USA simply doesn't work, but being in the core target for that 1980s' video game nostalgia, I had a smile on my face at first.Unfortunately the movie runs out of fuel quite fast and becomes ridiculous and repetitive fast. The last two thirds of the movie simply didn't have that many laughs, you get used & even bored with the pixel alien invasion quite fast and the special effects also suffer from that repetitiveness. And, honestly, the main character is soooo cliché...","9/10"
"Pixels","view_and_review","21 December 2015","Adam Sandler's movies dropped off of a cliff close to ten years ago. I mean, the very plots haven't even been interesting enough to get me to watch. I gave a go at ""Grown Ups"" only to be disappointed (as such I didn't bother with ""Grown Ups 2""). I gave ""Pixels"" a try for two reasons: 1.) I loved those 8 bit games the movie is based on and 2.) The trailers looked good.If we were to grade this movie on a curve (i.e. compare it to the Sandler movies of the last 10 years) then this would be at least a B+. If we were to grade it on its own merit, then I'm thinking more like a C. Acting was OK (he's long stop being funny), story was a bit flat and CGI/special effects were about what I expected. Nothing ground-breaking and nothing embarrassingly bad. If Sandler could just improve upon this movie; just build upon the successes of this movie and add more non-stale jokes, more range of actors than himself and his friends and something new then he may be able to recapture the success of old.","5/10"

It is very clear their target demographic was gamers and people with nostalgia for games like pac-man, and it works! I am a gamer and i really enjoyed this film. The special effects are some of the best I've seen in a film like for instance during the climax when the aliens are attacking new York they use the tetris blocks and when they line up by a building half of the bulding disappears.7/10: Decent","9/10"
"Pixels","T-ZER0","19 June 2019","This movie takes most of what we know about video games and spits on it. It's a shame that most people on IMDB can't even see that. Firstly, there are NO cheat codes on Arcade cabinets like Donkey Kong. I don't know why they made such a stupid plot point like that, but it's not true. Now our new generation will not know this about retro-gaming.Next, the military aren't stupid so that they don't recognize a pattern. One of my good friends was a war-veteran. He said that the army would train them with video games all the time. So the fact that they made the military unable to recognize patterns just to make Sandler look good is idiotic.Third, it's so unreal. How can Sandler's character just have clearance to walk into the White House? Why does he win the heart of the woman he creeped out? Why is Kevin James the President Of the United States? Why are women treated like trophies on this bad movie?Finally, they take a big insult to video games themselves. Toru Iwantani getting his hand bitten off by Pac-Man? I wonder why he agreed to such a humiliating scene? The whole Lady Lisa thing was so annoying. The fact that she was Q-Bert in the end was disgusting and mentioned by Sandler, but why the movie lets this slide is idiotic, Jeff Lee is probably very angry right now.Avoid this movie please, and stop trying to make it seem like a great movie about video games, because it's not. It's really bad. (I wish I could give it zero stars.)","7/10"

"Pixels","ginocox-206-336968","7 November 2015","""Pixels"" is exponentially better than expected, judging from the poster art and synopsis and having never seen the trailer. My expectations were so abysmally low that I felt compelled to watch a few minutes to satisfy my curiosity as to what they could possibly have been thinking. While it falls short of what I would consider a good movie that I would want to watch again to catch any subtle nuances, it has a few funny moments, the CGI animation is top-notch and it has a couple of amusing cameos. The film is infantile, schmaltzy and corny. Sandler's Brenner doesn't seem to grow, mature or develop much. Having risen to heroic stature to save humanity, he seems content to return to his life of mediocrity. We are left with a puerile fantasy fulfillment story with no moral that seems instead to pander to the self-indulgent mentality of adolescent video game addicts. As with many comedies, the romantic B stories also fail to rise above the level of adolescent wish fulfillment. The aliens seem contrived and inconsistent. They are smart enough to master intergalactic travel, but foolish enough to interpret a sort of travelogue film as a declaration of war. Q*bert indicates they were a happy planet until they received the message from earth, but they claim to have already destroyed many planets. When we do catch a glimpse of the aliens, in the guise of Q*bert, Max Headroom or Lady Lisa, they either join forces with the arcaders or inexplicably give them a second chance. ""12 Rounds,"" ""Predator,"" ""Saw"" and dozens of other films have antagonists who manage to engage the protagonist in twisted games much more convincingly. The movie goes to considerable lengths to make its characters unique, complex and multi-dimensional, but the aliens are generic 1950s B- movie aliens with twenty-first century weaponry. In the end, their departure is as unmotivated as their journey to our galaxy. We should also have seen Sinnamon. Her presence could have amped the stakes in the B story and provided fodder for jokes. The film is much better than I would have expected and has a few laugh-out-loud moments but never rises above the level of mindless entertainment.","1/10"
"Pixels","Jeice","26 July 2015","This was horrifying. A truly, god awful, cinematic release. Adam Sandler aside (though, yeah, he sucks in this too), the movie seems to take pride on this idea that the very demographic it's banking on seeing this movie, are a bunch of losers who live with their mothers, replaying games while covered in a cloud of Cheeto dust. Any sense of logical consistency (Which, yes, does matter even in a movie like this) is thrown out the window for arbitrary reasons. Are the aliens answering our call to war, via the video games we sent up with that probe? Or are they a confused, peaceful species? Is Q-bert a positive trophy for us? Or is he a traitor to their cause? The movie goes back and forth, and doesn't care because it's too busy trying to find some other ham fisted, bad joke about Pac man to make. Hell, the whole movie seems to just want to get you to give them money to be reminded that Centipede existed. Donkey Kong existed. If I tell you Galaga existed, can I get $24 million dollars in a weekend too? AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FACT THEY MADE A FEMALE CHARACTER INTO A LITERAL TROPHY, BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE.","8/10"
"Pixels","troyputland","28 August 2015","The least convincing aspect of Pixels is Kevin James as President of the United States. Did someone vote for Paul Blart, who thought this was a good idea? Sandler's his dorky friend whose stuck in his old, gaming hay-days. In the late 80's he was a gaming phenomenon, but was out- championed by a cocky kid (later played by the almighty Peter Dinklage). Nowadays, he's a wash out, with no real aim in life. Lucky for him then, that aliens start attacking earth in the form of video games. Video feeds of retro arcade games were sent in to outer space as a peace offering, not a admission of war. Sandler, his geeky friend Josh Gad and nemesis Peter Dinklage are the ones leading the defense. Just as unconvincing is the world relying on three gaming wizards. The acting hits all sorts of levels from mediocre (Sandler), to good (Dinklage, Monaghan), to over the top (Gad). Pixels is a lavish, easy to look at yet underwhelming comedy that's only appealing to gamers. At least we get to see Pac-Man and Donkey Kong on the big screen.","8/10"

But in the end my best friend Sven went to see it with his friends instead. I only went to see this at first because I was curious to see Peter Dinklage's performance. By the end of the movie I really had a great time. Yes, it feels like a Happy Gilmore movie yet surprisingly there is little of that probably because of Chris Columbus' direction. Sandler wasn't that much of a hyperactive moron, Kevin James played it cool, Monaghan was hot, Josh Gad got all the embarrassing lines and Dinklage was to me the highlight of the movie. Eddie Plant is probably one of the most bad ass characters in comedy. The fights between the nerds and the video game characters were beautiful, there are some great shots. In the end, this movie just like BvS doesn't deserve the hate for no apparent reason (the reason for this one being just because it is a Happy Gilmore production) and you should consider watching this only when you are free on the weekend. Also that ending was so funny I almost fell down.","9/10"

I mean for someone who loves playing video games. The beginning was OK, i was hoping that the idea of being able to play games well in order to save the world would be developed well. Too bad it wasn't. The film is awful. Honestly, it is somewhere around T-5, I mean you watch it and somewhere after the middle you start thinking-my god, how much more nonsense will come up? And yes, there is a lot. I mean , come on, couldn't it be just a little bit more detailed?

"Pixels","jellyneckr","12 December 2015","Pixels will perhaps best be remembered for being one of the biggest flops of 2015. While not as big a money-loser as something like Fantastic Four, it nonetheless didn't gross what it was expected to in the U.S., and therefore has a bit of a stigma attached to it. This is quite a shame, since Pixels is absolutely one of the better Happy Madison productions to be put out in the last decade. I'm not going to argue that Pixels is a masterpiece, or even anything close to being a great movie, but Pixels is, if nothing else, simply lots of fun.Pixels is a film that shouldn't even really appeal to me. I don't play video games, and I'm pretty much completely unaware of the history of any games past or present. As a result, I'm sure there are tons of video game references that I missed out on since I don't play video games, yet it never stopped me from enjoying the movie. Director Chris Columbus, who put together one of the best casts ever with Home Alone, fills the film with enough stars and solid actors that I was able to forgive the fact that the premise is beyond stupid. Columbus even manages to get what is probably a career best performance out of Kevin James as the president of the United States, who may or may not have been modeled after Chris Christie. Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, and Michelle Monaghan are great in supporting roles that easily could have been nothing characters. Brian Cox and Sean Bean, known more for their dramatic work, have enjoyable small parts here. But, as expected, the real star of Pixels is Adam Sandler, which is the real reason this film has been dumped upon so heavily by critics.If Pixels had starred almost anyone else other than Sandler, it would have received more positive reviews. For whatever reason, Sandler attracts the worst kind of venom from critics, more so than any other modern day movie star. In Pixels, Sandler is Sandler, which for some people might seem torturous, but was great for me since I love him. As per usual, Sandler plays an underachiever who could do a lot more with his life, though he's not much of a man-child like he is in most of his other flicks. Being the star of the film, Sandler gets the very best lines and most amount of screen time, yet this doesn't feel like a vanity project. Everyone in the cast gets to have their moments. Even with everyone in the cast getting to have key moments, the movie never feels overstuffed. Chris Columbus keeps the comedy and rhythm moving at a smooth pace. Not every joke hits, though even if I wasn't laughing out loud at a scene, the movie was always pleasant to watch.I can't deny that Pixels is dumb. However, the movie is about as good as any movie about aliens disguised as video game characters attacking Earth could have been. This easily could have become an over-budget mess filled with just non-stop destruction and noise. The fact that it works at all is somewhat miraculous. Pixels may find more of an audience on DVD, and will perhaps be viewed more favorably in a few years. The film is certainly way better than its current reputation as a complete dud. Recommended to Sandler fans. 7/10","7/10"

"Pixels","rgkarim","25 July 2015","Everyone says video games are bad for you as they are too violent or rot your mind. In Adam Sandler's latest comedy, those comments have been magnified as a race of alien beings misinterpret a deep space satellite transmission as a declaration of war and have chosen classic arcade games as their soldiers. Yes my friends, my next review is on none other than Pixels, a movie that may be one of the most ridiculous adventures to grace the theater. Hi I'm Robbie K and you're just in time for another review on the latest ""comedy"" release. When you think of Adam Sandler, as well as the plot summary above, you might tag the comedian with words like ridiculous, stupid, immature, etc. Well that might be true, but let's focus on some good qualities of his unique imagiantion. Pixels jumps back into the 80's to bring nostalgic memories of the endangered arcades to nerds like me and amplifies to monstrous proportions. After a fun trip back in time, we jump to the modern day world where Sandler and his typical crew are again the oddballs in popular culture. This is where one of the positives comes in, and that is Sandler's poking at the trends, stereotypes, and culture. I chuckled at the writer's jabs at our government system, mocking their obsession with war, country strives, and glorification of the military. In a manner along the lines of Revenge of the Nerds, nerds are shown to be powerful, using predictability and practice as the mighty tools of defense. This tired and true story line has a nice refreshing twist using games as the medium, but the story is lacking in so many ways. Most stories running tangent to the main plot are very shallow, nothing more than predictable moments that center on wishes shared by our beloved arcaders. How the aliens saw this as a threat, what they looked like, heck even the reasoning of their choices were cut short to be dumped into the flood of jokes this movie is filled with. Speaking of jokes, Pixels is more of Adam Sandler's tactics of being kiddy, geeky, and somehow sweet at the same time. Pixels has loads of his overdramatic, throaty yelling, often partnered with a drawn out with someone rambling on and making a fool of themselves. Other characters were drawn in to the awkward vortex as well, Peter Dinkelage especially dropping into the ludicrous 80's punk with a heavy accent that is more annoying than funny for me. However, I did enjoy some of the humor in this movie, especially witty quips at modern culture. Being a gamer myself I also laughed at a few of the gaming scenarios as well, despite many of them being ruined in the trailers. And yet Pixels humor gets lost in the teams inability to realize enough is enough. Sandler and his crew take their jokes too far, and don't let up until it is too late and the jokes are super stale that only kids will be cracking up at them. Because of this lack of balance, the movie's humor really only stays consistently funny to kids, who we know can't get enough of the things they love. Let's turn our attention to the game scenes now. Pixels art directors took an interesting path for this film, as they brought the pixelated warriors to life. Most of the soldiers look like high definition renditions of minecraft sprites, obviously designed to pop out of the screen in the 3-D viewings. The arcade games are colorful though, sporting the flashy vibrant hues and shades that caught our attentions all those years ago. Life is further imbued with the sound editing, the 8-bit bings, bongs, and other digital noises filling the high definition speakers and bringing you into the moment. The designers even translated the games 2-D movements into fluid 3-D excitement as the monsters and ships battle our real life defenders. As for the adventure itself, it's okay. The battles with the light guns start out exciting, but it doesn't take long before you realize it's just repeated movements of our heroes shooting left and right with the enemies barely adapting their strategy. As the journey continues, the actions gets better as the situations get a dab of cleverness added them all with an arcade twist. Butthey take the scenes too far, and cross into the overdramatic zone and losing its majesty. Exaggerated moves and simple comedy can't beef up the sequences, or improve the movie for that matter. The only thing that might have helped was the kicking 80's soundtrack that played throughout the movie, another fine moment of nostalgia. Okay so Pixels isn't the greatest movie ever, and it may be more of the same Sandler movie magic we've come to know. However, the movie is a fun trip back to a colorful time, and retro gamers will appreciate the references they make throughout the film. There isn't much of a story and things do go stale from time to time, but I think younger audience members will enjoy the adventure to be had. Word of warning, this movie has some fair bit of cursing. My recommendations are to hold off on this movie, as despite the cool special effects, it is not worth the high price of a ticket. The scores are:Comedy/Action/Sci-Fi: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0","5/10"

It's actually a very good film, once you can get over Kevin James being the President of the US. The 3D is not very noticeable most of the time. For those, like my husband, who remember the early 80s games, it's nostalgia. For those, like me, who don't, it's initially a bit confusing. Ultimately, it's a fun film, though there's not much to it. The post-ending shot is cute, though. Adam Sandler isn't quite his annoying usual self - back to the ""Bedtime Stories"" Adam, thank heavens. It's OK for a bit of fun.

"Pixels","eggs911","14 November 2015","I'd say I felt personally victimized by 'Pixels' (and by Sandler's presence in the film industry in general) but Adam Sandler's incessant need to portray nerdy men as victims is far stronger than any discomfort I had watching this embarrassing excuse of a film where women are literally trophies & men that play video games and act like children are paraded as underdogs. At one point Adam Sandler says ""For the record, I'm an amazing kisser. All us nerds are. We appreciate it more."" and if that doesn't clue you in to how absolutely terrible this movie is then you're probably the target audience. If you need more convincing, the visibly upset woman he just met & tried to kiss (and is also providing a service for, but to hell with professionalism!) calls him ""a 210 pound dork who installs flat screens for a living."" He retorts with some ""What if I was a billionaire and we were on my yacht and I wasn't 30 going on 13"" line, basically imploring her to admit she was being shallow. If you listen really, really carefully, you can collectively hear men around the world yelling ""OWNED!"" only to be hushed by their parents, because no respectable adult would watch this movie.","8/10"
"Pixels","mitnor","1 August 2015","I went to see this movie because it was a good show time, amidst a toss up of 4 movies, and in spite of the reviews. What a surprise! I laughed throughout.Yes, the writing could have been better, most of the characters were not believable (with the notable exception of the Wonder Kid who was very believable!), and some of the acting did appear somewhat stiff. I didn't think it detracted too much from the movie, as this is a silly movie. I think why I didn't mind the minor faults was that the movie was quick to point out some of them and make fun of itself. This is not a movie to take seriously, just like almost all of Sandler's previous ones. It is fun, the special effects are great, and it was entertaining.","8/10"
"Pixels","sophieveenafisher","9 August 2015","This is not the typical film I would go and watch, the plot didn't draw me in at all. The only reason I decided to view this film was because of the actors; Angela Demo, Barbara McCarthy, Jason Knight and John Buchan certainly done a great job on the casting. I have always been a big fan of Adam Sandler and Ashley Benson so although my opinions may be slightly biased, the film genuinely made me laugh and not many films can do that. The plot is entirely unrealistic but the visuals are interesting and different from anything that is already out there.I really liked the costume design in this movie, the clothing and style gave the characters personality and contributed well to the overall feel of the movie. I loved how the location of film changes, from different cities. The establishing shots helped to set the mood for each scene and kept the film flowing.Even if you are not a fan of this genre of movie and haven't particularly enjoyed Adam Sandler's work in the past then you should watch purely for the soundtrack alone, with music from Queen, even if you hate the film it makes the whole 106 minutes worth it.","10/10"
"Pixels","perryfjellman","25 September 2018","I've been a long time IMDb reader but the reviews of this movie are so bad that I finally made an account just to leave this review.Adam Sandler was perfect in this. I can't imagine anyone else playing it better. He's funny, charming, genuine, and has great chemistry with everyone in the film. The supporting cast did a great job. The one thing that doesn't add up is how the dweeb character of Kevin James became POTUS in the first place. But I overlooked that and enjoyed the movie for what it was. Entertaining, fun, a great story with great pacing and special effects. Sci fi fun, great action, and very well done all around.People need to chill out and get over themselves. These low reviews are not justified, make no sense, and are just Debbie downers who don't know a fun feel good film when they see it.There were so many little details in this that were spot on, and everyone's role, big or small, was executed very well. A great soundtrack and fun throwbacks to so many classic video games makes this a total win. Sandler, Columbus and crew should be very proud.I'm hoping and praying for a Pixels 2 soon! That would be so amazing. This was a fantastic movie. Ignore the armchair critics and see this with an open mind. You're gonna have a good time.","8/10"

"Pixels","idanvinter123","9 October 2015","Before I saw this film I saw some reviews from film critics, so I generally thought it'll be awful. When I was reading through the reviews in this site, I generally thought it maybe won't be so bad. Well I finally watched the movie and... Well the title says it all basically. Honestly, this movie was goddamn terrible. Half of the movie didn't make any sense, you couldn't feel any emotions for any character (not sure if that was the purpose), and one thing only drunk and complete morons could do: Kevin James as the US President ?!?!?! Who was stupid enough to think it'll make sense ?!?! Also this film is generally pretty idiotic and at times cheesy as hell. One last thing out all the dumb stuff that happened throughout this film, is that when Lady Lisa suddenly shows up, and after she have a little ''battle'' (pretty much she just shows Ludlow her moves), Ludlow suddenly says a kinda stupid line, then she begins to smile, and kiss him....? I put a question mark because when I saw this my jaw dropped from the level of stupidity of this scene. OK now look, the reason I gave it 2/10 is because the opening scene was the least awful scene in the entire movie, and because the way they created the classic video game characters were kinda nice. Overall, terrible movie, you can't have emotions for no character because almost 90% of the movie was utter non-sense, and if you let your kids watch this- you basically say ''Screw You Childhood !''","1/10"

What's not to like when all you want to do is relax and be entertained?! This is a very cute n funny movie. Is it a masterpiece? Of course not.. But it's a lighthearted comedy sure to please.

There was no proper story,the dialogues were childish, the acting was terrible and it felt similar to Sandler's recent movies. There were some good actors in this movie and all should review their film selection policy/agent. I really feel for Sandler because with proper director he can really bring a lot on screen but currently it feels like a son of a rich dad, who is paying to be on the screen. Time, money and IQ points lost. I hope people will not review movies like this in positive manner. This repetition of Adam Sandler movies is killing me and I just keep waiting for the one that will be at least a decent movie. Even Night Shyamlan performs better than Sandler.","7/10"
"Pixels","phoenixyk1","20 October 2015","OK! Lets get this out of the way... Adam Sandler has, in my view, the potential to be a great actor... ...That said, PIXELS is NOT him showing that he has that potential - Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler!!! If you have seen any Sandler movie before, you know exactly what you are going to get...And alongside him are all his old SNL Buddies which does not help people who review this movie as its all been done before.Kevin James as President Cooper should rightly get the WORST casting role... But actually he is not so bad.That Credit has to go to Peter Dinklage, Which is actually rather unfair - Dinklage acts brilliantly! Its just his character is so over the top and poorly written... And in all honesty, had ANYONE ELSE been given his role - They would have failed miserably...Much as his character is really poor... He manages to save it and you actually end up liking the piece of (Censored!)So, Yeah! The film is a typical Sandler-Fest... But honestly, its not as bad as many reviewers are making out.Yes there are some damn serious plot-holes... People like to argue about the Death Star Exhaust Port but trust me that has nothing on this film!!! (And if you still think that the Death Star Exhaust Port is a Plot Hole in Star Wars - Look for Dorkly on YouTube and see why its not!!!)Effects are great, the story is kind of fun, and it has some great elements of humour...But not a film for the kids... Sorry! It may look all harmless and fun but some of the content is pretty near the knuckle at times, so unless you are OK with your kids swearing - Give it a miss!Its not Sandlers greatest film ever... But more enjoyable than many give it credit for.","3/10"

"Pixels","jared-barnard","9 August 2015","As much as I love the zany Happy Madison films, they are typically eye-rollers. (Seriously, any movie with Kevin James as POTUS can't be taken seriously.) There will certainly be a generation gap with the audience in this film. Some will get it, some won't. My wife and I (both born in the early/mid 70's) took our kids (7, 9, 11) assuming they would probably enjoy it more than us. We were wrong. My wife and I were belly-laughing much of the time. And our kids laughed, too, but they didn't get most of it. (Our Singaporean audience didn't get a lot of the jokes, either.) Maybe we're just old enough to relate to these washed up gamers spending summers in front of REAL arcade games, where you had 3 lives before you had to cough up another quarter. When Max Headroom unexpectedly pops on the Silver Screen and starts to speak, how can you NOT laugh (if you even know who he is)?!?! Take a step back to your childhood (or a step in the childhood of your parents) and sit down to watch this one. It's predictable, and you may even roll your eyes a couple of times, but it WILL make you laugh. It could even become a cult classic...","8/10"
"Pixels","shae-rowe","9 August 2015","Quite possibly the worst film of this year... Pixels is nothing but another cheesy, lazy and awful attempt by Adam Sandler. Pixels plot doesn't even make sense, the film doesn't add up. Just watching Pixels I felt completely unimpressed and unrelaxed with the amount of lazy humour given by the cast, I remember feeling exhausted with the thought when is this perpetual film going to end. Pixels is also a disgrace to the gaming society, especially for those who are fans of arcade games because the film is unimaginative and unfond with the arcade characters, though this is the producers fault for not exploring with the characters. In my overall judgement the film has a lot of potential to offer; but unfortunately that is wasted by lazy directing, a poor storyline and the wrong film cast to create this movie.","1/10"
"Pixels","johnrodie","12 August 2015","I have never found any film of Sandler even mildly amusing before but I have to say that with Pixels I constantly laughed out loud, along with my 13 yr son and a cinema full of parents and children, all thoroughly enjoying themselves. yes it is an absurd concept for a film and full of stereotypical characters from the bombastic warmonger, geeks and conspiracy nuts to the usual American concept of British people, but the film knows that the characters are 2D and works to incorporate a huge amount of humour within those characters. The animation fully expresses the world of '80s video games wonderfully. As a previous reviewer stated this film is destined to become a cult classic. Yes it is stupid, pointless, totally unbelievable but at the same time if you aren't smiling inanely and wishing Q-Bert was your own trophy, then there s no hope in you saving the world with your humour or gaming skills.","1/10"

If your a little younger you'll still probably enjoy it.The movie is not without it's flaws but if you don't analyze it too much and just sit down with your bucket of popcorn and disengage the logical side of your brain for an hour and a half you'll be glad you did.It has romantic elements, plenty of silly moments, comedy that doesn't fall flat too often, a crazy plot which you just have to roll with and special effects that have a certain retro style that gels well with the movie. It reminded me of Ghostbusters which is not a bad thing.Ignore the low ratings and go see it so they make enough money to green light a sequel. Plleeeeaasse :)","5/10"

Personally I didn't grow up with arcade games because I was born in the 2000's but I did get nostalgia from it with Jump-Man (Mario), Pac-man, Donkey Kong, Tetris, Quibert, Astroid, Frogger, Duck Hunt, and Centipede but minus that it still is funny. I recommend this Sandler movie.","8/10"
"Pixels","beckyjospray","7 October 2015","I had low expectations for this move. Adam Sandler's films run the gamut and I was afraid this would be one of his more purile offerings.However, the story was well thought out, the humor -- for the most part -- kept within family watching ranges. The idea that aliens would consider our ""Space Time Capsule"" a challenge of war was hysterical. Bringing back the gamer world champions from that era was even funnier. Peter Dinklage was brilliant, in a creepy convict kind of way!As a children/teens gamer of the 70s and 80s, my husband and I loved this homage to our old stomping grounds, the arcade. This, much like Galaxy Quest, is a tribute to the genre and its fans. Love, love, LOVE it!My child, modern gamer, loved this movie as well. We will watching this movie frequently. This is a MUST WATCH movie!","6/10"

I thought this movie would be fun, but then I saw it was an Adam Sandler movie and assumed it would be lazy, boring, unfunny and stupid. Unable to resist seeing giant Pac-Man and Centipedes, I purchased the official DVD anyway (or maybe I just downloaded it; you decide.) I kept my thumb on the fast-forward until a video game sequence. When the video game sequences ended, and it switched back to ""plot"" and ""comedy"", I fast forwarded again to the next video game sequence. In this way, I was able to enjoy the entire 5 minute movie.Two stars for five minutes of fun. -1 star for being a Sandler movie.Bottom line: Best enjoyed in fast forward.","4/10"

And yet, I'm rolling through IMDb reading funny reviews of bad movies and I realize that this one has a strange amount of just... Praise. It seems that a lot of people born in the 80's (the word for it is target audience) rank this really high because ""Adam Sandler is funny and there's video game characters in it"" Go see the movie, make your own assessment but really, I refuse to believe that anyone reviewing this as positive isn't underage or just plain stupid. Go into it knowing you're seeing a horrid film. Kevin James isn't funny, Adam Sandler isn't funny. again, this is common knowledge at this point even. If you were born in the 80's and you legitimately like this movie I have the sneaking suspicion that you're lying because at this point a lot of people born in the 80's are closing in on 40 years old, and you'd think adults would have more sense than to just get all giddy over something that has characters from other things they like in it.

If there is one fault it offers nothing new and Sandler is still making nostalgic movie's but in saying that I hated Birdman, Whiplash and Child 44 which all got much higher ratings. At the end of the day it's an Adam Sandler movie, but there are a lot of nice touches in it like the registration plates on the Mini's,the Ghost Busters feel and Kevin James as the president which I find more believable than Donald Trump running!!

Whenever you hear the name Adam Sandler on a movie you think It's probably going to be bad, but that's not always true and this is one of the examples. Just like anyone else I am shocked to find Peter Dinklage in this movie, how did he get from Game of Thrones to this. The special effects in this movie were pretty good. One thing in this movie that everyone agrees on is that some of the stuff is pure dumb like, Kevin James being the president, now I think would Trump be better.

Video games coming to life, now who doesn't think thats cool? But the film wasn't what i expected. the characters were believable but obvious. Some of the action like the pacman scene being watched on the computer was kind of cheesy. It just didn't give a wow factor and i think the movie really could have done that. But for a new style of movie, it was a good shot and thumbs up to everyone involved. Unfortunately this is not a film I will be seeing again though. Once is enough.

"Pixels","doctorpoke","20 January 2017","Pixels was a movie I was optimistic about seeing. Then I saw it. The first of a few problems is the actors. Adam sandler is a good actor in this, but his character is bad, the female and the nerd dude are forgettable, Kevin James and Peter dinklage are awful (Acting and characters), and the rest of the cast is irrelevant. The plot loses cohesion as the movie progresses, and it is not explained how dinklage cheated on both the arcades and in the pac-man battle, and the aliens somehow know eddie cheated. The last and most glaring problem is major anachronisms throughout the film. As well as Madonna, Samantha Fox, Daryll Hills, John Oates, and Max Headroom all being relevant AFTER 1982, when the capsule was stated to have been launched, many games are also improperly shown. Arkanoid (Taj Mahal, it's not Breakout, as that was only on the Atari 2600 and 5200), The duck hunt dog, Paperboy, and tetris were all after 1982 (Duck hunt was released first in the 1970's, but the dog did not appear until 1984 on the NES). The only positive is the pixel effect. Though technically voxels, it still looks very nice. To quote Rotten Tomatoes ""Pixels has little replay value and is hardly worth a quarter.""","6/10"

Watching this has led me to forgive all the kids at primary school who bullied me for playing video games; the 'nerd' characters in this are abysmally written and will cause a spontaneous lobotomy.

"Captain Marvel","Leofwine_draca","24 February 2020","CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff.","6/10"
"Captain Marvel","morrison-dylan-fan","22 March 2019","Travelling to Birmingham to get Easter presents for friends and family,I decided that whilst in the city I would go catch a film. Visiting the oldest working cinema in the UK (The Electric) I found a flick with a run time that would give me just enough time to catch the train home,so I get set to see the new captain of the MCU.View on the film:Whilst facially de-aged with seamless CGI,Samuel (yel)L. Jackson swaggers with a coolness that has not aged one bit, with Jackson hitting Fury's comedic punch-lines with a smooth as silk ease. The first woman superhero in the Disney Marvel films to have her own solo movie, Brie Larson brings out the heroic in Marvel's passion to save the Skrulls, but fails to fly to a super height in the comedic,and establishment of her own origins,as Larson delivers punch lines with a stilted awkwardness which allows Jackson (who has worked with Larson three times) to outshine her in the jokes, and Larson also keeps a cold distance from giving Marvel the enthusiasm other superheros have when using their powers.Designed as a origin for Captain Marvel, the writers visibly show more interest in the side characters than they do in lead, with the plight of the Skrulls bringing a heart and urgency to the mission, which drifts away in the mid-section that focuses on Marvel's dry beginnings. Dipping into the Dr Strange-style fantastical with a striking sequence of Marvel fighting her inner turmoil, co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are joined by cinematographer Ben Davis in largely skipping over the enticing fantastical (save for a cute cat) to deliver slick Marvel Comics action set-pieces and Star Wars-inspired space ship races, wrapped in a catchy 90's soundtrack leaving No Doubt on Captain Marvel's powers.","5/10"

"Captain Marvel","panagiotis1993","4 April 2023","Live Reaction / Review for Captain Marvel (2019): I've been avoiding watching this movie for many years because I was sure its bad, but today I will watch it and decide if it is actually decent or not, I hope it is. I don't know anything about the character so this is all new for me. If I understand correctly she is not exactly (fully) human but Kree. The Kree have an enemy race called ''Skrulls'', ok that's an interesting concept already. The Kree seem to be like very very technologically advanced compared to humans. The Skrulls are shapeshifters which sucks if you are their enemy. Imagine having an enemy who could look like anything they want. I read that this movie takes place in 1995? So that makes it one of the ''oldest'' MCU movies I think. That's a nice change. So by accident Carol ends up on earth, I like that. Samuel Jackson looks so young, nice vfx. The first half hour is very decent. Oh boy this movie just reminded me how old computers were, huge and very slow. I like her suit, its a simple design but works.Bruh, she stole this dudes bike? Damn hahaha. I like the Carol/Fury team up I got to admit, i think they have good chemistry as a team. Ok the first hour is good but it got a bit slow, the pacing, still good though. I don't know how much sense it makes but the way she got her powers looks really cool. Wait so the Skrulls are not the evil ones after all? This just got a bit more intereresting. In the avengers movie Carol seems to be a cold, emotionless almost person. But in this movie that's not the case, she is friendly, likeable and has also some decent jokes and sense of humor. Her updated costume looks cooler than the previous one. The cat is so cute. Calling the cat Flerken and thinking its a threat is kinda funny, whats up with that? What the hell is wrong with this cat? Is it actually a monster? So the Kree (or some of them) were the villains after all. I like how it connects to the Avengers movies in the post-credit scene. Ok, this movie while it's not a masterpiece, its very decent. Decent plot, cinematography, some good jokes, no cringe moments, good performances, pacing and action.A fun movie overall and worth watching. I think it gets much more hate than it deserves. Definitely better than Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Thor: Love and Thunder. My rating is 7.5/10.","7/10"

"Captain Marvel","gangstah_vino","6 March 2019","I don't want to adress the hate, but let's try to forget it for a second and just appreciate the film for what it is: a film. thank you.First of all, the intro of the mcu logo was great. youll see what i mean when you see the film and I appreciate the creators for doing it as they did.Now... first the good stuff:
1. Samuel L. Jackson: He played a more softened Nick Fury, but very much ""agent coulson prior avengers"" like, with a lot of attitude, sarcastic humor and less serious. Also the de-aging is becoming so good, that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked. His character was very well done on script and screen.2. Some of the action: The space battle stuff etc. was very well done. the special effects team did an amazing job at this movie. nothing felt or looked fake. kudos!3. Surprise surprise: the story. From the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting. The way they introduce her past was very originally done. The way she remembers things through different ways was clever.. very clever even, because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through.. it added to the story while adding to her character. Also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while.4. Ben Mendelson: really impressive job. very layered surpringsly and stand out in my books. the acting is general was very goodthe bad:1. It misses spectacle... and a standout moment. in thor 3 for example; you had the intro scene, and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thor's powers. i feel you didnt get that in this movie.2. Like I said the story was great, the execution a.k.a. the screenplay/script lacked... they had such great storypoints, but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion. the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real. she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit, since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like; ""but you didnt deserve that yet..."" Ben's character had a more emotional impact on me than carol... yikes!! (and i dont mean that in a killmonger-t'challa kind of way)3. some of the action again: some action just wasn't good. there is a moment she is fighting the skrull(the moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer) and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed... which is weird, because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed.All in all, the film was good. nothing more and nothing less. i missed an emotional attachment to the main character. I felt like i still didnt know her after the film, and i think that's because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film. she was supposed to be a bit arrogant, but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the STRONGEST creature in the world and they made me believe that btw. she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film. believe me! Wonderwoman's vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol, and basically made her less relatable.so that's why i gave it a 7. it's definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided. especially the way she got her powers(hihihi geeks out). Go see it. it is nowhere near as bad as iron man 2/thor 2, but it doesn't touch civil war, infinity war etc. either, its like rifght in the middle. inbetween those 20+ films.","7/10"
"Captain Marvel","ghufranalhabshi","12 March 2019","I wasnt gonna watch this movie because of the negative reviews it was getting even before the release, but i said to myself *its a marvel movie,how bad could it be* let me tell you, it was definitely a great movie. maybe not the best one but definitely worth the watch. The plot twists were great, the Message behind it is even better. Samuel L jackson on his own deserves a solid 7, I have no idea why it was getting so much hate. sure , brie larson isnt the perfect fit like rdj is iron man. but she's not horrible either. the movie was 2 hours long and it didnt feel like it, It had Adequate humor and emotions. Lets not forget the post credit scene either. captain marvel is STRONG. period.","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","malomar12","8 March 2019","I'm really not sure what the young male audience was expecting for this movie that p**sed them off so much they had to write these nasty reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed Brie Larson's take as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Maybe they were expecting cleavage?She was given a limited storyline to work with and ran with it. At least this story kept me awake after I fell asleep several times during Black Panther. Samuel L. Jackson was up to the task of playing a younger version of Fury but the CGI of Coulsen left a lot to be desired and I'm guessing many of the Coulsen scenes were left on the cutting room floor.My biggest gripe was the music. I do remember the 90's as kind of a black hole for music in general, but there was some good stuff and NONE of it made into this movie.","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","EnoVarma","6 March 2019","I was left with the general feeling, that ""Captain Marvel"" is a major disappointment.First of all, there is a good story here somewhere, but it's just not well told, and there's too much of it crammed within about 115 minutes. The movie is fast-paced, but never really works, because the pacing is flat and timing is off. Aesthetically, ""Captain Marvel"" has been processed through the same ""Marvel filter"" as the rest of them. Dull. The filmmakers (indie directors of the great ""Half Nelson"") have given absolutely no attention to the music: the score is completely forgettable as are the 90's songs.As for the themes, the MGTOW people are going to have a field day with ""Captain Marvel's"" less than subtle ""feminist agenda"". I'm putting that in quotations, because it's more accurately described as simply female agenda. Which is absolutely fine and commendable; the problem is the infantile in-your-face way the filmmakers address the theme. The movie is set in the year 1995, and it really feels made for that year's audience. ""Captain Marvel"" lacks a fresh perspective. And, by the way, any fans of ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"" will immediately recognise one pivotal scene lifted from a truly powerful scene in the series finale. In any case, Carol Danvers of the comics was always a decidedly feminist character, so this shouldn't cause any waves. What's lacking, is Carol's wide array of problems: her character history in the comics is one of the craziest in the Marvel universe (which is saying something.). Movie's much simpler.The biggest disappointment, however, is the resourceful Brie Larson. She's just off. I don't know what happened, but the brilliant actress from ""Room"" is nowhere to be seen. She was just the wrong choice, I guess. Still, I'm surprised by her lackluster-ness. The cast isn't great, anyways, but at least Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn seem to be having fun.Unlike me, for the most part.","4/10"
"Captain Marvel","vithiet","18 March 2019","So I was hoping this would be a great movie and I could write a review telling misogynists to shut up because it's fantastic to have a strong female superhero as a lead character. Alas, in that regard Wonder Woman did a lot better as a movie as a whole.The acting is not that great between Brie Larson's poor performance and the prosthetic/GCI on Samuel L. Jackson that makes him look younger but also gives him an expressionless wooden appearance. There are very obvious plot holes (like, wait, how did they know to do that?) and the pacing is very uneven; there are a few parts during which I didn't feel engaged at all.On the plus side it does fairly well as an origin story, and there is that Marvel level of polish in special effects and editing. All in all, it might be a necessary introduction to Captain Marvel for Avengers End Game, but it is probably the weakest MCU movie to date.EDIT: 2 years later and I watched it a second time as part of my MCU chronological order marathon, and it is actually better than I originally felt. A lot of the above points still stand but I was a bit harsh because it didn't meet my expectations at the time. I now change my original 6/10 to a 7/10 as it's a fairly entertaining movie and is truly an essential part of the MCU saga leading to Endgame.","7/10"
"Captain Marvel","BrokenBeats94","9 March 2019","I feel Captain Marvel had a lot of pressure being an origin movie at the heels of Avengers Endgame, which is less than a month away!However I'm glad to say Captain Marvel is a decent origin story but don't expect anything on the level of Guardians / Thor Ragnarok / Infinity War.The film has a rocky start - a fear of lack of personality and a plot structure that throws you off at first. The film's development definitely got better as the film progressed which definitely stops it falling short.For MCU fans - we got a lot of Nick Fury in this movie which is awesome because it definitely adds a lot of fun to this movie and the de-ageing CGI is impressive.The feminist stance isn't too heavy-handed within the film, though absolutely commendable in a relatable way. On the other hand, I'd probably say Wonder Woman is a better female led superhero movie.I watched this movie in 3D and the 3D visuals in this movie are not particularly good - scenes were too dark on top of the 3D tint (this maybe theater dependent but I do work at a cinema).Plot wise, it's not an essential watch but definitely a solid standalone entry and had a nice lead in to Endgame. I look forward to seeing other directors working with her character!7.5 / light 8 out of 10","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","verolaruiz","10 March 2019","I have watched every Marvel movie ever and I am glad that they have been including more female characters.

"Captain Marvel","tigrezangelietr","9 March 2019","I truly enjoyed the movie. As a stand alone origin story movie is good. It has very low stakes relative to Avengers Endgame, but I see it as a good thing - not every single movie needs to be heavily tight to every other movie of the MCU.

"Captain Marvel","ygor_lacerda","11 March 2019","Ok, I've created very high expectations for this movie specially after Infinity War and since the very first trailer but they were a little bit shaked after checking the first reviews here...Really, 5.8!? What da hell!?!? OMG!Anyway, I went to the very release date to watch it already quite sad, trying to erase all those high expectations I' created... just in case...I'm following up MCU since the very beginning and it was hard for me to believe that on the merge of a new era for the MCU they would screw it (mind my words)...Well, after watching the movie for the first time I've realized that I should never disregard the high expectations I've created! That's not the best MCU, of course not but it's not bad at all, it really doesn't deserve any grade below 7!Those who have reviewed it with low grade should bear in mind that it's a movie that focus in the creation of a character. I wonder if these people have being following the whole MCU from the very beginning... there's no way to create a movie that focus in the creation of a new character without exploring the character like they did in this movie.Brie Larson is brilliant in this role, yes she is awesome, funny, bad ass, beautiful not to mention Samuel and Clark, I consider it one of the best performances for Samuel in the MCU and btw, what a fantastic CGI work for Fury and Coulson, awesome!The script is quite nice, maybe Marvel's just failed in not depicting the Krees role in the previous movies but the M.A.O.S. does it pretty well.There's a lot of action as expected, drama, fun (Goose masters it!lol), all ingredients a good movie needs.Looking forward to what is going to happen in End Game.Do not take in an account what others think, go and watch it for yourself and then decide if it's a good movie or not, for me it is, I've already watched it twice and would watch it again for sure!Enjoy it!","10/10"

"Captain Marvel","elinkatla","10 March 2019","I have to admit I did not go into the cinema with high expectations. But boy was I surprised! The movie is one of the best MCU movies out there! The plot is very good and stable the whole way through which I don't see very often with superhero movies, the special effects are done amazingly, and the acting is very good.I really don't get all the hate on Brie and why everyone is saying she's not fit for the role and that she has no personality etc. I highly recommend that you don't read the bad reviews because they are wrong, and I'm very sure a lot of the hate comments are written by anti feminist men who are not happy there's a female leading superhero movie! The humor in the movie is also great, which always helps and Goose completely steals the scene! Overall, it's an amazing movie which you should give a chance and it does not deserve all the hate it's getting.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","dagallop","15 August 2019","Wow! Marvel + good story line. I thought it wasn't possible but they did it, they actually provided the viewing public a movie that has a good story line.No taking the credit from the makeup artists as well as the CGI people, no Marvel movie would be worthy of even a fleeting glance without them, but in this movie they excelled. Sam Jackson looks like he could be a teenager. Great work. Additionally he is probably the best actor in the entire Avengers bunch, well was, Brie Larson does a phenomenal job, up against the likes of Jude Law she demonstrates that an epoch in the industry isn't required to be convincing.Back to the story line; it works! Sadly, this may be the first Marvel offering that not only has a fair story but doesn't get so convoluted it becomes a distraction. It also fills in quite a few blanks along the way.I never hold comic book type movies in very high esteem but this would be the exception. It is just a pity that the Marvel folks may force Brie to work with some of the other pathetic characters that bore my socks off!Synopsis: a good family movie with some great CGI, good acting and a nice story line.","9/10"

Like Panther, it succeeds in teeing up the next Avengers movie, but it does so in a more direct and powerful way. The story of Carol Danvers' self-discovery unfolds unconventionally, but ultimately its convoluted elements coalesce and the newly mature character who emerges in the finale is probably the most badass figure in the MCU. The movie packed in just the right mix of humor, action, nostalgia, humanity and fantasy - something for everyone. I plan to see it again soon.","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","scb_coldsteel","8 March 2019","So I just saw Captain Marvel at the theater. I did my best to ignore the insane amount of false moral rage surrounding the movie on the internet so I could walk in with a less biased perception. Overall I'm glad I gave this movie the chance it deserved. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it certainly was an entertaining origin story that further added to the Marvel cinematic universe.The basic plot of the movie acts both as an origin story for Captain Marvel and also a tie-in for the upcoming Avengers film. Acting as an origin film the movie checks all of the necessary boxes. It mixed elements of an intergalactic space drama, traditional super hero fare, and provided some great throwback references to the comics. I won't go into any details because I don't want spoil the plot, but overall it was a fun and action packed origin story.Of course at this point Disney has these films down to a science. As expected the movie seamlessly blends drama, action, comedy, and references to the larger Marvel Universe. It's a fun formula that really doesn't disappoint on a superficial blockbuster level. Once the film finds its groove it is hard not to smile at the mix of action and humor.I also have to mention how well the film captured the time period. Any 90s baby will get a kick out of the many cultural artifacts from that era. I literally want to watch the movie again just to catch so many of the references. Plus the movie loving paid tribute to Stan Lee. It may have brought a tear to my eye seeing him on the big screen again.The movie was pure eye candy. The graphics were absolutely phenomenal and brought Captain Marvel's cosmic level powers to life. Seeing her at full power really should remind the audience why she is one of the most powerful Avengers. All of the action is sure to entertain pretty much everyone.I didn't see any problems with the acting at all. Brie Larson is a phenomenal actress and she brought a nice combination of levity and badass attitude to the role. Of course what is not to love about seeing Samuel Jackson as a young Nick Fury?If you went simply off the online user metrics your would think this was a terrible film. It was far from bad, but it certainly had its issues. Pacing was a major issue as the second arc of the film really slowed down the progression of the film. I also felt like the movie never provided a big enough conflict to showcase Captain Marvel's power scale and artificially blunted her powers through most of the movie with a plot device. Of course that's the issue with introducing an overpowered character by Captain Marvel just to tie into fighting Thanos for a future film. Plot wise there were also a few events that were a tad bit too convenient and really weakened the overarching story.Captain Marvel hardly reinvents the wheel as a superhero film. It firmly follows the establish Disney formula and acts largely as an excuse to have Captain Marvel act as a MacGuffin for the Infinity War conflict. Still Captain Marvel was a very fun film. Ignore the hate online from internet trolls who love to play their false moral outrage at every turn. The movie wasn't perfect, but it delivered exactly what I expect from a Disney Marvel film at this point. A 8.25 out of 10.","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","chandean-69762","17 February 2021","Let's be honest, we all only watch this for Goose.Captain Marvel really doesn't deserve all the hate it gets. Brie Larson overall goes a good job with Captain Marvel, she's not the best don't get me wrong, she has her ups and downs with her performances for sure. But I feel that she captures the attitude and structure of the character nicely.
Action is good, visuals are great, score is meh but still decent, sometimes the CGi can look off but overall it's what you expect from a Marvel movie, and the deaging for the characters like Sam Jackson's Nick Fury and Clark Greggs Coulson is actually super impressive and never took me out of the film.
Overall just a fun Marvel movie that feels extremely comic book-y and is probably exactly what you'd expect if you've watched most of the Marvel movies thus far.","8/10"

This film had a lovely female actress playing the main character, this film truly did showcase the HUGE potential a female actress and female character can have on a film. I feel because of this film's success it is also one step closer to getting 50% screentime for women on average on all films and TV shows. The special effects left me swooning and they felt out of this world, overall I think it was the right thing for Disney to decide to change Captain Marvel's gender.

Yes, it starts really slow, but it's about Carol finding out who she really is and just how powerful she can be.The all-star cast is what makes it great. Who thought that Jude Law could play a really good villain? And it wad good to see familiar faces (Clark Gregg and Samuel L.

Finally a marvel movie without some kind of focus on two people having some kind of will they/won't they relationship. (Steve and peggy, Tony and pepper, black widow and every other male, etc) The only relationship the movie focuses on is Carol's relationship with herself... finding out who she really is.

"Captain Marvel","FrenchEddieFelson","13 March 2019","First of all, Brie Larson is one of my favorite young actresses, with Room and Short Term 12 for instance. So, I could not miss a Marvel with Brie Larson. In addition, the special effects are rather well done, and the film is funny (especially the danger detector that would not work according to Nick Fury). But it lacks a I-do-not-know-too-what in order to make it an excellent movie. In particular, the film is insufficiently pedagogic about the capabilities of the main character: in exactly 7 minutes (timed and verified at second viewing), we elliptically switch from a woman who does karate, manually warms a kettle and is able to send energy flows from her fists, without really knowing why or how, to a woman whose power seems limitless, on a scale we have never seen before in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. In a few weeks, within Avengers 4, she will be one character among too many others super heroes, while we barely know her. I wanted more about her. I still want more!","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","jamiedarlow-37510","26 March 2020","Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) is trained up to use her new mysterious power to its full potential by the Kree after being found by them. When escaping from another alien group, she returns to Earth and discovers there's much more to her past and origins than initially thought. Marvel Studios have absolutely got it in the bag and have done for a long time; setting a high benchmark with Infinity War in 2018 and just flawlessly pulling off action spectacle and superhero integrity in everything they do. Admittedly through the first half of this one, I did find it strangely slow burning and not as engaging as previous episodes despite the spectacle and heart that was clearly being poured into it. Nevertheless, I started gradually feeling it more as it progressed and I came out of it feeling energetic and happy! I think the humour and soundtrack had a lot to do with my involvement in the film; it's hilarious at times (Goose the cat is one hell of a creation!) and the music references from Carol wearing Nine Inch Nails and Pixies shirts to the song choices being perfect, made for really brilliant sequences. The film has a lot of substance underneath its surface which I felt more in the final half which has moments of epic beauty and the realisation of Captain Marvel's beginnings is stunning. I'd like to watch the film again and discover more from the early stages too (other than the beautifully incredible opening paying tribute to Stan!) which I may have missed. Performance wise the ever reliable and amazing Brie Larson delivers totally and brings another fresh and exciting character to the MCU. This is Nick Fury's finest hour on screen also as Sam L Jackson is fantastic as always! Filmmaking duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson, It's Kind Of A Funny Story) inject a unique style into the film particularly in the Earth sequences which are full of laughs; it's a promising and enriching start to Carol Denvers' story","9/10"

Unlike the unrealistic beauty of Wonder Woman, the captain of the surprise gives a warrior's steel hard feeling, and the overall viewing effect is good! The scene of the first egg surprise captain rushing back to Earth, although not specially rendered, still feels so shocking!","10/10"

"Captain Marvel","bedaniel","11 March 2019","DC did Marvel a fine act by coming out with the amazing Wonder Woman film. I'm not gonna compare the two films, but I will say Captain Marvel stands alone as a great superhero movie. Not just a great female superhero movie, but a great superhero movie, period.Honestly, I believe most of the negative reviews are people's insecurities getting the best of them. Some claim the acting or the character development. Please... She has the greatest strength, just like in the comics. The movie is funny, follows a great storyline, and connects well in the overall MCU. People just don't know what a movie wihtout a white male lead looks like.","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","mochteam","13 July 2019","I heard mostly complaints about the movie because of a statement that Brie Larsen never even made. The film got attacked because people chose to believe a lie someone created. It always pays to do your own research before jumping on the band wagon folks.Captain Marvel obviously is the Wonder Woman of the MCU. I've been into comics especially the Marvel ones for a long time. Captain Marvel was a guy at the time but even still he was a pretty bland one that got mixed in with all the rest. Changing him over to a female did make the character much interesting. There aren't that many super - super powered characters in the MCU aside from the Phoenix.In the comics there's a lot of powerful women but for some reason in Hollywood there's not. I just don't know what it really is about Hollywood and Comic adaptions when it comes to women and minority comic book characters. ""Storm"" for example is just as popular as Wolverine as a fan favorite but in the movies her character barely serves any purpose. There was also ""Psylocke"" another fan favorite female character with a reduced role that barely made them important. I just never understood the disconnect of Hollywood with Comicbook fans when it comes to certain characters.Out of all the MCU movies they're of course just male leads. Black Panther and Captain Marvel were the only movies that broke the mold. Captain Marvel certainly being the only Female lead super hero movie I can think of (and no I won't even acknowledge that Dark Phoenix nonsense). I can't get upset with the ""girl power"" theme when I've been watching male super hero movies for the past 30 years of my life.I was actually grateful when Wonder Woman came out because I've been a long time fan of her and it was long overdue for her movie. Captain Marvel though is a wild card. She's not really a popular comic character and doesn't have huge fan base like Wonder Woman had. So this movie starts from scratch. As an origin story I found it as charming as I did all the other movies. It was different and the character of Captain Marvel was unique. I didn't get a ""Bat Woman"" vibe from the movie. I actually got more of a Metroid Samus Aryan vibe. The first parts of the movie were a bit rough as you try to figure out what's going on and so much is thrown at you but it catches up mid way and starts to make more sense. I feel like it would get better with a second movie now that Captain Marvel is established and they can actually focus on a story where as in this film they identified the Villains.I didn't find it to be a bad movie probably on par with the original Iron Man that wasn't as exciting as the other movies became either. Time will tell though if these gets better with the later additions.","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","thepriceofpayne","8 March 2019","I believe Screen Junkies put it best, this is a Phase One Movie in a Phase Three world. This is the first marvel film in a while that felt that the direction was faceless. Where the Russo's, Waititi, Gunn, Coogler, and even Reed (Among Others) shined Fleck and Boden's direction felt fairly faceless as the film comes off as just another Marvel outing. However it's not without it's charm. The visuals are stellar to look at, and the makeup on the fan-favorite Skrulls is a sight for sore eyes. The performances by Jackson and Mendelssohn are fantastic, but the movie wouldn't be anything without its leading lady. Brie Larson turns is a fine performance and it's great to see this character finally integrated into the MCU, however she's given very little to work with, and there's not much that truly distinguishes her yet, that's not the fault of Larson, just a writing and direction problem. The film is a fine spectacle, and a nice solo venture, but there's just not much originality that we've seen with the past slate of Marvel films.","10/10"

"Captain Marvel","JottaH","9 March 2019","First, let's address the elephant in the room.
This movie is getting review bombed by a certain crowd for the progressive ideals of the actress playing Captain Marvel. They not only review bomb by pressing the star rating, but also by posting seemingly well-thought out reviews giving the movie 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, anything to make the overall rating go down.Don't believe the hate, this movie is EVERY BIT as much fun as other Marvel movies. Humor? Check. Well acted? Check. Lovely references? Check. Action-packed? Check. Heartfelt? Check.I wouldn't place it at the very top, but it's a solid 8 when matched against others.Going into more detail would mean spoilers and I believe that people should be able to see beyond the hatred coming from fragile egos.

"Captain Marvel","grantpaulsen","6 March 2019","This is a very controversial Marvel film. Which seems to be a running trend with Disney films recently. The hype around this film seems to be very mixed, some want it to succeed and some want it to fail, and both sides seem to have these viewpoints due to various political reasons. There seems to be a lot of agendas involved. I do not have any stake in either side because I do not care about this kind of thing when it comes to film. I don't think it's fair to judge films from that perspective in a positive or negative way. In the same sense that I don't think it's fair to judge a film from a positive or negative perspective based on whether or not you like the actors involved. I don't care if films succeed or fail financially. Film is an art form to me and I just want to see films that are well-made by people who have a lot of passion for their craft.
To start with things I liked, there's some spurts of entertainment that come from this film. Some fun action scenes, the chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson was very on point. The de-aging effects for Samuel Jackson and Clark Gregg were surprisingly great. The first act overall was relatively enjoyable, especially the opening action scene. The music/score was pretty good. And the cat was a fun addition. But overall the film was very bland and disappointing.
Honestly, I was hoping for better. To me a superhero movie needs to have an interesting story, well developed characters, and it needs to grab me and make me care about what's going on. This applies to film in general. One of the saddest things about this film that I was genuinely hoping I wouldn't have to say is that I don't think Brie Larson did a good job in this film. Brie Larson is an incredibly talented actress so I don't necessarily think she's to blame for that, it might have just been the poor material she was given to work with. As the film progresses she gets increasingly more stoic, and the film never showcases any emotion or vulnerability towards the character for some reason. And her character is given almost all backstory with too much exposition and very little depth. And at the same time there isn't enough given to make you care about her or any of the characters. Overall I don't think she fit the character, the performance was very wooden and uneven. Which is sad to say because you can tell how much passion she's giving towards this character.
The narrative is so scattered that she kind of gets lost in the shuffle & they forget to develop her character. Which was disappointing for me. The storytelling was very messy. This film is trying to be an origin story, a connecting piece to the past as well as to what's going on now, and a set up film for what's to come later. So the film kind of collapsed in on itself because it's trying to do too many things at once.
This honestly felt like Phase 1, which is not a good thing. That's not to say that Iron Man and The Avengers weren't good, it's just that this film feels a lot like the early Marvel films in the sense that it felt like they were still in an experimental phase. They were still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't work about their films. They've passed that point and they know what works by now so this film as well as all the other new ones should be progressive steps forward, and this film was definitely a gigantic step backwards.
They also don't do a good job making this character feel important or relevant to what's currently going on in the MCU. We're told she's the most powerful character in the MCU, but they never show us that or make us feel that way. The film is a lot of telling rather than showing. Needless to say the writing and directing were pretty lackluster. Also the action other than the opening was not very good or memorable at all.
The Skrulls were fun villains, and relatively unique compared to other Marvel villains, but they weren't really given any character.
There was a lot of fun 90s references but I think the film relies on this as a crutch way too much. Which caused the tone to be very disjointed. They have 90s nostalgia for a little bit, then it feels like a buddy cop film with Nick Fury, and then it's a story about the friendship between her and Lashana Lynch's character. And there's no effort given to make the audience feel emotionally invested in any of these stories. And since it's always jumping back and forth between these contrasting tones, and that made the film uneven as a result.
There are some needless explanations for things that happen in the MCU and when they happened it felt corny and forced.
The film was a fun time but this is the 21st Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so at this point generic fun action films are old and tired. And since there have been dozens of Marvel films at this point they need to live up to a higher standard. So in order for me to like their films at this point they have to do something more than just making a fun movie. I can't believe I'm saying this but DC did it better. Wonder Woman had charm, charisma, and character development. And I Captain Marvel definitely fell flat in this regard. Again, there are moments of potential here, but they are hiding under the bland cliched Marvel formula. It's a very generic film that we've seen many times before not just when it comes to superhero movies, and I was hoping for more than that. 5/10.
Please see the film though and make up your own opinion on it. Don't listen to what others say, don't give in to online agendas no matter what side they're on. Just go see the film, make up your own mind, and when you do be honest about it, because that's how we get better films, by letting the filmmakers know what works and what doesn't work about their films.
But at the end of the day the fact that this film didn't live up to its potential doesn't matter, and I'm still very excited because...

Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Finally get to learn how he lost an eye. No spoilers but it's a lot of great special effects and Capt Marvel proves to be a superhero to be reckoned with as she battles aliens.

Brie Larson is incredible has the main character, she really comes alive, never appears to bored once. I love the mid 90's setting, considering it is set before any of the marvel movies. Samuel L. Jackson really steals some of the movie has a young Nick Fury. I like the idea it's different from other Marvel movies, really stands alone, the film has twists some critics won't see coming.

I enjoy watching most superhero movies unless they are really bad, and I can't remember the last time I came across a really bad one. I find them to be a good mental escape.There are lots of negative reviews, and ""1"" or ""2"" ratings, for this movie, and I can't understand why. Maybe because one little thing about the movie disappoints a viewer and they use that as an excuse to review it harshly? Maybe some object to a female in the Captain Marvel role?For me I really enjoyed this movie. I like Brie Larson and I like the performance she gives here. The whole movie is a bit whimsical and Larson's character often acts in whimsical ways.

Particularly Captain Marvel stealing the guys bike who tells her to smile, and blasting Yon-Rogg after he goes on about how proud he is of her and that she will only be ""ready"" when she beats him in a fight with no weapons.The backstory was great and left it open for sequels or prequels (and probably a Netflix series too).Absolutely bloody brilliant.I think everyone who complained about this movie were really looking hard for things to complain about.

"Captain Marvel","bopdog","9 March 2019","I walked into the theater with low expectations, but was blown away. OMG - ""Captain Marvel"" was AWESOME. I suspect the initial low ratings on IMDb were from ""fanboys"" and other young people who wanted chases and shoot-em-ups - the kind of mass melees and Battle Royales seen in the Avenger gang fight movies. That's OK - each to his own taste! But this Marvel movie actually dealt with real and important themes that sucked me right in, and kept me riveted until the end.In my personal cosmology, on some level we are all the same, and time does not exist, except as a shared construct, and perception is projection (i.e., in some way we make it all up). OK - that's me. But to see Marvel wrestle with these ideas, present them in a fascinating and thrilling story-line, AND feature a cat? I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven. Do not be mislead - there is tons of action, too, and brilliant FX and Sci-Fi dazzle.And... it doesn't hurt that Brie Larson is sturdy, talented, and adorable. And this was Samuel L. Jackson's best role in what? 20 Years? He played a good guy for once... even kind of a hero. That sat VERY well on him. I hope he considers doing more positive movie roles henceforth.Bottom line: if you've been watching Marvel/DC movies with a child's eye, consider if it is time to step up to a grown-up version. You stand a chance of advancing your movie-art appreciation with this. Possibly. And if not, let enough time pass until you're ready for the adult world. Please consider that this might be a great movie to begin life like the grown-ups do it. You'll have a blast!","10/10"

Samuel L Jackson is awesome as always. Goose the cat added some fun for everyone as well. All the hype surrounding this movie and what Brie said was all B.S. just trolls looking for a reason to troll and most people took their bait.
Think for yourself. Go see it with an open mind then make your own decision. Dont let social media decide for you.
My daughters are 7 and 3 and loved seeing Brie represent a badass woman, just as I have always loved seeing Batman, wolverine and Hulk. We as a family cant wait to see her slap Thanos around. Loved it and would see it again.","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","broshrimp","9 March 2019","Watching Captain Marvel, saw it twice, is like having someone read a captain marvel comic book to you, while on some sort of wonderful hallucinogen. It is a surreal experience, the plot twist, the origin stories, the background lore, the quips, the hits! All of the characters, especially Ole Sam, he's perfect in this, and Ben Mendelsohn's character Talos, well it did it for me. Larson conquers the role from her first appearance till after-credit scene. I am unsure what else one would want or expect from the character, she was the personification of it. The facial CGI on Sam, and as well on Larson's younger selves, is incredible. 10/10 would go higher further faster again.","10/10"

"Captain Marvel","Lis_G","12 January 2020","I really enjoyed this film and it's one of the best Marvel films, in my opinion. Love the 80s/90s references. Good characters (Brie does a fantastic job in the title role and Samuel is great as always), and well-written storyline -particularly with how Agent Fury links in and how it all fits with the Marvel universe. Film moves along at a decent pace, no boring bits, and some humourous parts too, thanks to Goose!","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","alex_wiky","12 November 2019","I was a person who neglected Captain Marvel because of the negative reviews. But I actually enjoyed Captain Marvel after watching it! Samuel Jackson, Jude Law and the guy who played Tarlos waa awesome. Yes I admit Brie Larson has a young-girl-ish voice but her acting was ok for a super hero.For those who call this a feminist movie: As a female I didn't notice such agenda. However it addresses some of the issues/barriers that was there during the early 90's. Plus it shows about good female friendships and all kinds friendships, strength of a single mom, the hidden potential of a ill-treated girl... So yeah I like Captain Marvel! It's about finding yourself.Overall CM is a good movie - watch it yourself to decide :)","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","Fudge-3","9 March 2019","Vers is trained as a Kree soldier to defend their empire from shape-shifting Skrull infiltrators. She has only no memories of her life before adulthood but in her dreams she sees a woman with a kind face and wise eyes.It's another treat of a superhero putting down the villains with great special effects and nice one-liners. It's a decent script and I thought her origin story was well told without taking up too much screen time. The humour is well played and Brie Larson does look good in that, 'rubber suit.'I liked the cat and the portrayal of 1990s technology that looks Victorian by modern standards. Was that Windows 95 or 3.1? There are two post movie Easter egg scenes and I enjoyed them both very much.Criticisms? It seems petit but Danvers doesn't quite have the personality stature to match her uber powers when they get released near the end of the film. We could have lost the girly squeal of delight at that time.It's a bit loud for young children but everyone else will enjoy it.","8/10"

It was also funny to see Nick Fury as well!I can see why not many people like this movie since it showed Captain Marvel getting her super powers to the point where she has become the strongest avenger.Another reason could be because Wonder Woman came out as well, and it was better than this, according to certain fans.Either way, the movie was good in my opinion.Brie Larson looked pretty good as Captain Marvel!It is a good idea to watch this, so you know how the story line goes in Infinity War, Endgame, and the upcoming movies.","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","kingitonga","22 July 2019","This film is really well done.I was afraid to watch it because almost everyone i met was negative about it but then i took time and i watched it and i love most of it, thought there are a few areas i would have loved to see more done.Let me talk about the story first, its well plotted, and the twist that comes with it got me gripped even more, though something wasn't about the ""center"" of the story wasn't well explained, i didn't get to understand how Dr. Wendy Lawson got a hold of the tesseract and really why she wanted to end the war, i would have appreciated to feel this need to end the war first, and see this conflict between the two alien races. And if Carol Denvers and his team were killing the innocent skrulls without knowing, i would expect her to be really charged up with guilt and sorrow for working for the enemy, not just her but i would expect some of her team mates to see this too and defect if possible and let the good guys and bad guys have a clear line between them. Those two parts would have really improved the story further in my opinion.The funny bits on the film were very mature and the had me laugh out loud, because many marvel film have really terrible jokes but this film did it very well. The CGI was very well used apart from some instances i could tell its looks like CGI but most of the time i couldn't tell.The Acting and Directing and Cinematography is perfect, every character fitted their roles.Am going to rewatch this film once again, i feel there's still more good stuff in there.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","gcsman","8 March 2019","I've seen this movie twice now. The first time through it felt a little disjointed, but I'm happy to say that the second time through the various pieces fell together better. The whole storyline is essentially one uninterrupted sequence beginning with Carol on the Kree home planet Hala, through the guerilla mission against the Skrulls, and on to Earth where she meets Nick Fury and pieces out her true identity. There are really no side plots. My thoughts overall:First and most basic, this is a new Marvel Studios movie to have fun with. It's another chance to sit back and absorb yourself in a gratifying fantasy world with superheros doing their thing. What's not to like? The usual great production values, and a stacked cast including Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law, Annette Bening, Ben Mendelsohn, Gemma Chan -- and of course the scene-stealing cat Goose (whose character poster has just been voted the fan favorite).Before I forget to mention this: the end credits are beautifully done. They have the same style and feel as the credits from Wonder Woman (2017), which were also beautiful. Kudos!I'm pretty sure most of us in the theater were waiting for the second half where Carol finally goes full Binary mode (as briefly shown in the second trailer) and sure enough this carries a great Wow! factor. We haven't seen this kind of mid-air (or mid-space) heavyweight fight sequence since Man of Steel, which qualifies her for the MCU's Superwoman. I'm *never* going to get tired of watching that section and have my fingers crossed that we'll get more in Avengers Endgame. Also, I was wondering how they were going to do the costume transition from the rather cold green/blue tones of the Kree into the warmer, much more appealing classic red/blue design. The way it's done is really clever.But I'll probably just have to get used to Brie Larson's fairly light-textured voice. Like some others who've commented on this, I would have preferred it to have more weight (compare the voices of Bening or Chan in this movie). But my daughter assures me that it's all OK. if it's fine with younger viewers in the audience (particularly girls) who are seeing themselves represented on screen, then I won't complain.On the other hand, the most important bit of dialog in the movie comes very near the end where Carol pronounces ""I have nothing to prove to you"" to one of the key characters in a way that takes the classic stereotypical ""final confrontation of hero with villain"" scene and stands it on its head. Right on!! There are a number of feminist-flavor statements or setups throughout the film, but that one scene is where it really does hit home.From the trailers I think a lot of us figured that this ""origin story"" was going to depart significantly from the comic-book origins of CM (which the MCU has done with a number of other important characters). But ... yes and no. First, half the scenes in the trailers never appeared in the movie. But second, the story ended up hewing surprisingly close to the line in the CM comics, with just a couple of character switches. It's ingeniously done. There is just one MAJOR change from the comics storyline vis-a-vis the Kree and Skrulls, which I won't give away, and which works well enough and also retroactively ties in with certain plot elements of the the Agents of Shield TV series.The well publicized motion-capture and de-aging of Fury and Coulson is pretty good, but the technique is still not seamless (Coulson particularly looked somewhat artificial). It would just make more sense to me, if something is set well in the past, not to spend a lot of screen time on familiar characters de-aged.Bottom line for me is that this is a good movie, without being the MCU's best. It does however fill a necessary step in the extended Avengers/Thanos/etc. storyline that has been building up for so long. Yes CM does push social boundaries, but not as much as Black Panther did. What I mean is that for BP, virtually the entire cast were black. To be equally radical for women, the MCU needs to make a movie where almost all the superheros are female ... and to point out the obvious, they've already made a bunch where they're almost all male, so why not? Let's have it, Marvel!OK: now for the trolls, who sadly but predictably jumped on the ratings for CM just like they said in their ludicrous flame-wars before its release. I REALLY wish the rest of us didn't have to waste our time with these hypersensitive misogynists whose only aim is to destroy. However, what's new about their pathetically nasty reactions to CM is that finally these have become outrageous enough that they have provoked collective counterattacks at the institutional level, not just from individuals. The Rotten Tomatoes site has taken steps to purge them, and the entire Disney corporation has actually stepped in with its own response. Not that I'm automatically in favor of what Disney does (e.g. their gutless firing of director James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy), but in this case I think they are doing the right thing. Society has to work out a better way to prevent the damages that trolling, hate speech, and misogyny can wreak. And a necessary step is just what's happening now -- to expose them for what they are in the cold light of day.However, in the meantime we need to have some tools to get Troll-Free Ratings (TFRs) for the movies we care about. Fortunately, IMdB provides the material to do that, because unlike other sites it actually supplies full breakdowns of the viewer voting. Here's how to use the IMdB scores easily and conveniently to get a TFR:First look at the bar graph of the voters' ratings (which you get by clicking on the number of voters just below the mean score). For CM you'll see a pile of votes in the 1/10 bin. Those are the trolls. Eliminate that bin from the average, and you'll get a much more accurate score. Even quicker, look at the ""median"" rating which does better than the average at de-weighting extremely low or high votes. (Just for fun, look at how CM rates with ""females under 18"" versus ""males over 45"".)Better yet, just look at the shape of the bar graph and it's obvious where the true center is. For CM, it's about 7.5, and I think that's fairly much on the mark. This center is technically called the mode of the distribution, and there is a useful statistical rule of thumb to calculate it, which is this: mode = 3 (median) - 2 (mean). For example, at the time when I'm writing this, CM has 86,475 votes with a mean of 6.8 (heavily dragged down by more than 11,000 trolls) and a median of 7. The mode is then 7.4. The ""mode"" is a terrific way to get the TFR.BUT: (and this is important): the great majority of IMdB voters are male, whereas the moviegoing public is pretty much half-and-half male and female. So a still better thing to do, after you've cut out the trolls, is to take the men's rating and average it *equally* with the women's rating. Thanks to IMdb showing these details broken down by age and gender, you can do that. Women do rate CM higher, but once you eliminate the troll votes it's actually not much higher. than the men.As a final thought, you'll see a pileup of votes in the 10/10 bin too. So are these people ""anti-trolls""? Not necessarily. I would argue that a 10/10 vote here is a lot more likely to be sincere and representative of the movie's impact on that viewer than a 1/10 vote is. The aim of an absurdly low vote is to destroy, whereas the aim of an only-slightly-high vote is to promote. Here I'll side with the promoters.","8/10"

Everyone goes to criticize like they're getting paid for it instead of just watching movies to enjoy them. I believe the actress chosen portrayed Captain Marvel well. She has a dry sense of humor but that doesn't make her flat. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think it's worth adding to the marvel collection. People are so harsh and egotistical.

"Captain Marvel","jkeitz","10 March 2019","I have to begin with noting that, while I have always been a fan of Captain Marvel, I was worried after hearing the star of the movie's bigoted views. I had hoped for the best, but expected to be let down. I am happy to say that I was presently surprised. While this is an origin story, I really liked the original way of introducing the character. Every member of the cast, right down to the cat, was outstanding. Larson and Jackson have great chemistry, leading to excellent humorous scenes. Also on that note, I have to admit that despite her personal issues, Larson knocked this out of the park. I don't think anyone else could have embodied Carol Danvers better. Have to give credit where due. This is already one of my favorite Marvel movies, right behind the Guardians.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","murrayspeer","5 November 2019","The mid-90s in sci-fi and superhero movies were almost universally moody, slow-paced, and under lit. (Think Batman Forever, Independence Day, The Shadow, Stargate, The Crow, Strange Days, Species, Highlander III, etc.) I don't think Captain Marvel needed to copy that atmosphere entirely, but I sure would have liked more opportunities to feel like I was in a 90s movie. For example, if the action had taken place in the dark until Carol embraces her power which coincides with the first full sunrise of the movie, which could be teased as she moves toward that acceptance, it would have had much deeper significance. Overall it lacked the visionary feeling of the best recent Marvel Studios films. All of that being said, I really enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to watching it again. 9/10","10/10"

Past that is a terrific story that is filled with laughter, awe, action, drama and yes there is a strong women's vibe. And there should be, CM is one of the most powerful characters in the MCU so anyone complaining that she's too powerful or that the fights are too easy should really pick up a comic.
Brie does a fantastic job at starting the film as a characteristic ""flyboy(girl)"" and morphs into a badass hero who clearly digs her unleashed power and is not afraid to show it. Shes someone who stands to be a beacon for all in the MCU. (I can't wait for the banter between her and the other heroes)

"Captain Marvel","MajorMAlice","10 March 2019","Captain Marvel is a good film, not a great film. It's not perfect either, but which of the MCU movies is? It is entertaining though. It is definitely a WHOLE lot better than the Thor MCU movies or the original Hulk entry. Is it Infinity War good? No way. Guardians of the Galaxy good? Not quite, but just about.Larson's character is a little dull and the reaction to some of her jokes and banter with Fury was just as dull in the theater we saw it in.Coulson's (Clark Gregg) screen time is little to none, and as an Agents of Shield fan, I was personally sad that it did not explore more of his character.Samuel Jackson was Samuel Jackson like you see him in every movie he's ever been in. The Skrulls were cool. The cat was funny. The bit of background that the producers decided to add in this film was just about right.The 90's feel was pretty well done, from Rock the Vote posters to the ""Madonna"" look, to the cars.In as far as the 'PC'-ness some are complaining about and which are generating 90% of the bad reviews, it is really the same PCness these people look for and disparage in every movie they see. Look at the reviews for Jumanji, Welcome to the Jungle. ""They"" will find it in anything, because they live their lives looking for it. For every bad review, there is a person who: 1. Promised they wouldn't see it even though they knew they would; 2. Didn't see it, but rated it badly anyway (and WILL eventually see it); 3. Those who otherwise would not see it, but because of all the controversy will now see it. As such, I don't have to suggest anyone see this film. I'm pretty certain most everyone, on this planet at least, will. :)","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","masonsaul","8 March 2019","Captain Marvel is probably the most generic MCU movie without ever straying into actually awful territory. Essentially an overly familiar origin story saved by a breezy pace, strong supporting cast and some genuinely smart decisions when it comes to handling the Skrulls that completely avoids any potential uncomfortable subtext.The decision to make Carol Danvers a blank slate for the majority means Brie Larson is given next to nothing to work with, having to rely instead on the trademark quips and charm that she obviously excels at. It's also a lot of fun whenever she shares the screen with Samuel L. Jackson, who gets to show a more fun loving side to a younger Fury.Ben Mendelsohn is easily the film's saving grace. Talos both plays into and cleverly subverts the kind of character he's usually given in these kinds of films. An initially one note villain with so much more going on beneath the surface who delivers the majority of the film's best jokes.To say Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden directed the film feels inaccurate. This is the most bland, voiceless, clearly made by a studio construction any of these have had. Nothing is terrible yet very little is memorable which is so frustrating for a film that starts with one of the best opening shots of any MCU film.Pinor Toprak's score is actually amazing. It's the only aspect that's full of life, wearing its inspirations on its sleeve and favouring creating something new over callbacks. The film also has plenty of time on the soundtrack to include so many iconic 90s songs without overloading itself.","10/10"

Acting=7
Plot=9
Ending=9

Movie Score= 8.4One thing to say about MCU is they always get a stellar cast...I guess that's the appropriate term for a movie like this. The acting isn't top notch strictly because movies like this aren't really about the performance.Plot: Carol Danvers becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. I love origin stories that go back in time, but to be honest I was hooked as soon as I saw that Blockbuster in the trailer. With a mid and end credits scene, the ending is worth a watch as it ties into Endgame. Unfortunately, I found a few story holes that gave me pause, but all-in-all they did a good job.Favorite Quote: ""You know anything about a lady blowing up a Blockbuster? Witnesses say she was dressed for laser tag.""Let's see how the Genre scores add up...Imagine=10
CGI=9
Pace=8If Captain Marvel was to get full marks, it has to come at least close to the comic book. I saw good detail on the Skrulls and the war with the Kree...maximum effort here. The CGI was great, but not exceptional...loved the Anti-aging CGI on Fury, but Coulson no so much. The pace was solid, albeit predictable for a comic book film...all boxes were checked but no surprises.Comic=7
Funny=7
Genre Score: 8.2Total Score: 8.3I got a little teary-eyed when she crashed into that Blockbuster...but not in the reason you might think. Knowing the connection between Captain Marvel and my favorite Marvel character, I was really looking forward to this. This was a solid watch...it checks all the boxes for an MCU movie. The only thing was there was no great story hitch or unique twist to make it great.Who's my favorite Marvel character? Silver Surfer","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","sweidman-28016","12 March 2019","Captain Marvel Review:Captain Marvel is the 21st film in the MCU and it follows Carol Danvers who becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. As most of you know I'm a huge Marvel fan so there was no question that I wanted to see this. Unlike most audience members, I really liked this film (you can read about the audience stuff in my rant post). I thought it was an interesting and intriguing origin story. Anna Biden and Ryan Fleck did a good job directing this. This was their first major film so good for them. Marvel likes to do that. Brie Larson as Carol Danvers was a perfect fit. I thought she developed the character well and made it her own. She's clever, ambitious, and sometimes humorous which made the film very enjoyable with her scenes. Not only that but her relationship with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) was literally the best part of the film. The chemistry was spot on and it made the friendship believable and feel real. He did great as Nick Fury again. This is probably one of my favorite performances that he did with Nick Fury. Annette Bening was in it briefly but I loved her. She's such an amazing actress. There's a twist with her character that was cool and might upset some who are true to the comics but I don't care. I should also add the cat, Goose, is an amazing character and I loved him! All the characters made for an enjoyable film and a good plot. Something I really loved about the plot was it made for questioning and thinking throughout so it was like a drama. Yes, there's action, and may I add very good action scenes, but the drama aspect was my favorite. The visual effects were pretty good in this. Lots of cool stuff, especially in the first shot you see of the Kree planet (I forgot the name of it). There were a few spots that were noticeable with it but not many. The makeup and hairstyling was very good. I thought it was cool what they did. I liked the super suits and costumes. The cinematography was pretty good for a marvel film. There were a few shots, one in particular that takes place outside in a backyard a little past sunset that I really liked. It reminded me kind of Annihilation with the shot of Natalie Portman walking towards The Shimmer. It was also colorful like Thor: Ragnarok. The score I would consider colorful too. It was interesting and pretty good. It had a tech vibe to it, also like Thor: Ragnarok. Since the movie takes place in the 90s, there's some pretty good songs added. One sequence in the final battle had a perfect song playing. Some thought it was dumb and copying Guardians of the Galaxy but I thought it was fun. Also Guardians of the Galaxy is apart of the MCU and people loved those sequences so what's the big problem?! I didn't have too many problems with this movie. The only thing I'd say is there's a part at the beginning with a trippy sequence that made it hard to follow. I understand it was supposed to do that, but it made an awkward shift. It was predictable what was going to happen to with the conflict. Also there's a reoccurring thing that comes to play in major role that was in the other MCU films that left me having to research it because something seemed out of the timeline then. Once I figured it out it made sense but there's one part I still question. Other than that I thought this was a great addition to the MCU and Captain Marvel will be a great addition in Avengers: Endgame. If you haven't seen the other films you could probably still watch this. There may be a few things you won't understand but it's a great time watching this film!My Grade: A-","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","CANpatbuck3664","9 March 2019","I'm not familiar with the character of Captain Marvel from the comics so coming in as a fresh face, I think they did a good job of developing her from start to finish. They even utilize a couple of story devices that I'm getting sick of like the protagonist suffering from amnesia. I feel like the Bourne movies made that a popular story element and its been repeated again and again. But in Captain Marvel, it allows us to learn about Ms. Danvers without her losing her resolve or requiring a huge exposition dump near the start of the movie. They integrate her flashbacks well and in an artistic manner to make them more palatable. I was interested in where Danvers had come from and while her overall arc may not break the mould, they gradually feed you little bits of her personality. This helps keep your interest up and helps the movie get through some of the slower scenes.I also like how the movie plays with the idea that changing perspectives on a situation can shine a light on what's really going on. There's a curveball thrown in with the Skrulls that was inspired for a comic book movie and I liked how Carol had the wherewithal to figure out what was going on and adjust. Her motivation was pure but there was room for interpretation because of how much she was altered by her experiences. It was a nice touch and I appreciated how the movie wasn't committed to a very straightforward and simplistic narrative.The controversy surrounding Captain Marvel centres around it's star Brie Larson because of some comments she made. I think that its largely overblown and it shouldn't affect how you perceive the movie. I think she's great as Carol Danvers and her performance is the engine that drives Captain Marvel. She hits all the right beats and has the makings of a formidable player in future Marvel movies. She didn't blow me away but I expected good things and she met those expectations. Samuel L. Jackson is charming and charismatic in everything and he works well with Larson to form a pretty solid duo. Annette Bening got an interesting part as Dr. Wendy Lawson and the Supreme Intelligence and I think she made the most of her screen time. I initially groaned when I saw that Ben Mendelsohn was playing Talos, he's a great actor but he's been in so many villainous roles lately, he's being oversaturated. But due to the nice twist with his character, he sold it and was an effective member of this cast. Lashana Lynch was good with what she had to work with, her best scenes come in the last act and she got her chance to shine. I also thought Jude Law did well in his role as Yon-Rogg who serves as an early mentor to Vers.As much as I want to tell you that Captain Marvel revolutionizes the genre and will be remembered as the pinnacle of Marvel's stable of movies, that's not the case here. I'm going to put it in the really good but not great category, objectively there's nothing wrong with that but Captain Marvel represents a solid execution of the Marvel playbook with only a few surprises. I did genuinely like the twist with the Skrulls but I'm not going to be walking away applauding how bold and fresh Captain Marvel is outside of that. The 2nd act has stretches that border on being too slow, they aren't without purpose but the pace does have a little slack in it. The only other real complaint I had was it would have been nice to see more action with Danvers using her entire power set. We get some good scenes at the end but as she even says that she's been fighting ""with one hand tied behind my back.""I was lucky enough to see this with 2 friends and we all walked out of the movie shrugging our shoulders but largely singing Captain Marvel's praises. We all agreed that it featured good performances from the cast, that they weaved the Carol Danvers storyline into the larger MCU as well as they could have (including utilizing some well worn plot threads like the hero having amnesia or the twist reveal of the real antagonist) and that Captain Marvel amounted to artistic and fun execution of the MCU origin story. I don't think this will be remembered as one of the best MCU movies and much like recent comic book movies Wonder Woman and Black Panther, it will have a hard time living up to all the hype surrounding the production. There are some slow stretches (mostly in the middle) and while it executes the formula well, there isn't much that's going to shock or surprise if you're familiar with most of the movies in the MCU. But this is a movie that at minimum achieves what it wants to achieve and has some shining moments scattered throughout the film. As long as you haven't turned against it already, I think you'll have fun with Captain Marvel and its worth checking out in the theatre.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","Chalice_Of_Evil","7 March 2019","After a nice acknowledgement of the late Stan Lee (and all his cameos throughout the Marvel films) in the MARVEL opening logo and a special tribute to him, the film begins with us introduced to Brie Larson's Carol Danvers (currently going by the name Vers), who has a blue nosebleed, has clearly been in a fight and/or accident, and as a result is suffering fragmented memories of her previous life. First thing you'll have to adapt to with this film is its non-linear storytelling. We shift between past and present, which gives you an idea of just how confused Carol must be feeling. She's a Kree, which are 'noble warrior heroes' who fight against green aliens called Skulls. She's part of a team led by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). They have an interesting relationship, trading jabs at one another, but clearly respecting each other too.Also of note in the film are the relationships between Larson's Carol and the other characters. When something happens that leads to Carol crash-landing into a Blockbuster video store on Earth, it's not long before she encounters a younger version of Nick Fury (a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson, who's actually *likeable* here thankfully, as I'd been getting tired of him appearing in everything and pretty much playing himself every time). Their relationship is pretty much the 'heart' of the movie. Fury starts off wary of her, but eventually comes to respect/admire her and a trust forms between them.One reason why Fury's so likeable in this film is his dynamic with Carol, but another reason is his love for the scene-stealing not-cat named Goose, who got the biggest laughs, though isn't the only source of humour in the movie. It also comes from the 90's being...the 90's (slow typing and loading on computers, movie/TV show/music references, etc) and Carol herself. Despite what certain others have said, Carol is NOT 'unlikeable'. Claims of her trying to make snarky comments like Tony Stark and coming off as a worse person than him couldn't be further from the truth. I personally have had enough of Mr. Snark and his mumbled speed-talking. Carol has a wry sense of humour and comes off as a pretty cool person you'd actually *want* to hang with (five minutes spent with Tony and I'm fairly sure most people, even his 'fans', would be punching him like Carol punches a Skrull disguised as an old lady in this film).Speaking of Skrulls, Ben Mendelsohn's Skrull character, Talos, starts off as your typical villain. He looks alien, but acts quite 'human' with his line deliveries/references/etc. However, he actually proves to be not quite what he seems and it allows for interesting character development. Another important relationship Carol has is with her former fellow fighter pilot, Maria Rambeau, and her daughter. Their friendship proves crucial to the story. The movie really hits its stride once all these^ characters come together. Carol surrounds herself with a good group of characters who prove useful, but who don't take away from her.The story of Carol Danvers is about what makes her who she is. Those against her try to make her a 'better'/'the best' version of herself, but we're shown that what makes her special isn't her powers, but rather her humanity and who she is as a person. Having said that, when she finally lets loose with her powers in all their glowing, gravity-defying-hair glory...it's quite something to behold (and set perfectly to classic 90's music). Some will claim she's 'overpowered', but she's no more 'overpowered' than Superman or various other male superheroes.And that's^ the crux of the issue here for some people...that she's doing what male superheroes can do. For certain types of people there seems to be five stages when it comes to seeing a female-led movie: 1) Anger (""How DARE a female be the lead! Women should only be side characters/love interests/villains!""), 2) Denial (""This movie isn't successful! It's a flop!""...despite all evidence to the contrary), 3) Attempting to 'rationalize' the film's success (""This movie's only successful because..."" insert lame excuse here such as people only liking it because of some 'agenda', people being 'paid' to say good things, etc), 4) Whininess (""WHY do they keep doing this?! Making more female-led movies...don't they know these genres like sci-fi, superheroes, etc are meant to be MALE-oriented?"") and 5) Seeking out new targets, starting all over again/lather, rinse, repeat (sadly, there's no 'Acceptance' stage for these people). Seeing the negativity regarding this film only proves one thing: there's a LOT of insecure people out there.This is a 'different' sort of Marvel film...but in no way 'bad'. It's about time they shook things up a bit and gave us something new, as it prevents things from getting 'stale' (the only expected thing here is two credits scenes, one in the middle and one at the end...both of which are worth sticking around for). And if Captain Marvel is to eventually take over from Tony Stark as head of the Avengers...I, for one, welcome our new alien DNA-infused leader.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","ahmed_zizo73","9 March 2019","I don't know why so many bad review but in my opinion I really enjoyed every second of this movie.
Brie Larson was good and I see she acts well with no risks.
I love the cat and Samuel Jackson specially with comedy scenes.
I like the sequence of movie thanks to it's director.
Only the end scene wasn't perfect cause it seems captain marvel is like a god with no weakness.
but at all it's fun movie and different than any marvel movie and this give it more depth.
it should take 9 rating but I give 10 cause I didn't get bored of any scenes during watching.","10/10"

It's a funny, well paced superhero movie with well rounded writing of strong female leads that broaches the tricky and often hostile world of women in a boys club. It's entertaining, well acted, CGI is believable and the music is awesome! Don't believe the online smear campaign of fragile egos that are dumping all over this film, it's a very good action flick. Plus the cat is really cool.","10/10"

"Captain Marvel","tomgillespie2002","18 March 2019","It says a lot about the mammoth universe built by Kevin Feige and the folks at Marvel over the past 11 years that merely the glimpse of a modified pager displaying the colours of their costume is enough to generate a huge amount of buzz around the arrival of a new superhero. Captain Marvel's introduction was teased during the traditional post-credits stinger of last year's Avengers: Infinity War, and now, just under a year later, Brie Larson's Carol Danvers finally makes her bow. Black Panther became a cultural phenomenon, and Infinity War delivered and then some on its promise to bring this breathtaking (first) saga closer to an end, so the small-scale and light-hearted Ant-Man and the Wasp was a welcome, if underwhelming palette cleanser. Captain Marvel is the studio's first female-led superhero film, so there's a weight of expectation behind Marvel once again.There has been a wave of ugliness online in protest against the idea of female empowerment and Brie Larson's pro-feminist comments before the film even premiered, but an opening weekend of north of $500 million has silenced the haters and, with any hope, brought us closer to a future when a hero's gender or sexuality is irrelevant to a film's success. Captain Marvel is far from perfect. In fact, it relies heavily on Marvel's tried-and-tested origin story formula we saw a lot of when this universe was still in its first phase, although directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck toy around with the structure enough to keep things slightly less familiar. Anyone who was keen to write Captain Marvel off as an example of forced diversity should take the time to actually watch it. Don't get me wrong, the film takes a strong pro-feminist stance and tackles issues plaguing our modern world, but it does so with subtlety. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel is strong, confident, even arrogant at times, but just like Tony Stark or Dr. Strange, she is also flawed, troubled and - despite the mystery surrounding her ancestry - recognisably human.The warrior known as Vers (Larson) is a member of Starforce, an elite band of soldiers operating within the Kree Empire tasked with infiltrating the Skrulls, a race of shape-shifting aliens they have been at war with since before they can remember. Vers is troubled by dreams that feel like memories she does not remember, but her commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) trains her to put aside her emotion to focus on the enemy. During a mission to rescue one Starforce's own, Vera is captured by Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), who proceeds to dissect her memories before they all crash down on a strange, primitive planet. That planet is Earth, and the year is 1995. It isn't long before an eager, two-eyed agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. called Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is drawn to this mysterious stranger and is caught up in her desire to uncover the secrets of her past, along with learning of an intergalactic war that may one day threaten his home. With the help of old friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and a cat named Goose, Vers discovers that she was born Carol Danvers, and that everything she has been taught about who she is and what she's fighting for may actually be a lie.Although Marvel have done period before with Captain America: The First Avenger back in 2011, Boden and Fleck were clearly having fun revelling in some 90's nostalgia. Although some of the music choices are a little on-the-nose, the appearance of a Blockbuster store and the sound of a dial-up internet connection will delight those, like me, who grew up in the decade. The big joke is that while Carol embarks on galaxy-hopping adventures with the Kree, down here on Earth everything takes an age to load. Captain Marvel switches seamlessly between these two extremes with good humour, and for a character that is destined to become the franchise's next cosmic powerhouse, the low-key approach to her origin actually works in the film's favour. It also allows time for Larson to develop the character, whether it be bouncing off Jackson's one-liners or discovering her old self with her best friend. Larson is great: strong but not over-powered, cocky but endearing. Despite Mendelsohn's scene-stealing, Larson ensures that it'll be Captain Marvel's appearance you'll be eagerly awaiting in the upcoming Avengers: Endgame. Formulaic? Certainly, but Marvel knows how to entertain, and they can't exactly re-define the genre with every film.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","itsbobr","19 June 2019","After finally discovering who she is Vers/ Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) knows what her mission is when two Alien forces go to war.I was ready to shut this down within 10-minutes because no one could tell what was going on. We see loads of CGI battles, some banter between Vers (yes, that's Brie Larson, too) and Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and also with Vers and Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening), and very darkened scenes as well and we still had no idea what was going on.The movie that we will come to understand is when Vers lands on planet C-53, that's Earth. Now, as we go along, we will begin to understand all that confusion we saw in the first 10-minutes. So hang in there, it's quite good. It's a good story as Carol begins to piece together her life and who she was and who she is now when for 6-years everyone thought Carol died in that crash with Dr. Lawson (Annette Bening).What are the Kree after? They are after a core energy source to control the entire universe. When Carol shoots at the engine she believes is the core energy source (in the plane she and Dr. Lawson were in) there is a power surge into Carol's body and that is where her powers come from.Notables: Samuel L. Jackson as Shield Agent, Fury and he believes Carol is a good guy and becomes her side-kick so to speak; Clark Gregg as Shield Agent Phil Coulson; Ben Mendelsohn as Talos who convinces Carol she is on the wrong side; Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeay, a friend and fellow test pilot back in the day before Carol crashed; Annette Bening plays a bad person as Supreme Intelligence and a good one as Dr. Wendy Lawson; (yes, this can get confusing); Lee Pace as Ronan, a Kree soldier under Yon-Rogg; Djimon Hounsou as Korath a Kree warrior under Yon-Rogg.We do see Stan Lee as Stan Lee as a passenger on a train. The music was very, very good all the way through.Now, here's the thing. At no time was Carol Danvers referred to as Captain Marvel, and you now know where her powers came from so there was no Shazam. See? Billy Batson and his Shazam remain safe. Carol will come to be known as Captain Marvel or as MAR VEL as Carol recalled the real name of Dr. Lawson...... maybe. After the credits run we will see a scene for a sequel to this movie, and then there is a statement that says Captain Marvel will also be in AVENGERS ENDGAME. Can't wait.So this was very enjoyable and I am glad I didn't shut it down. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Yes, quite a few good lines. Language: Brief small stuff.
Rating: A","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","DeadMansTrousers","8 March 2019","People are becoming far too obnoxious when reviewing comic book movies. Bad reviews including coments like ""you've seen one you've seen them all"" are evidence of exactly that. When you read a comic book or go to see a movie based off one you go for fun and to be entertained. Not to see a preformance of a Shakespeare play, or an Oscar winning film.Point being is that if you can't just go to enjoy these films for the entertainment they provide without harshly picking them apart or turning into an internet troll over them...simply don't.Overall I found this movie highly enjoyable, and I thought Brie Larson did a good job. I thought the soundtrack was perfect and I loved all the 90s nostalgia sprinkled throughout the film. I recommend you ignore the trolls and decide on your own what you think of this.","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","PyroSikTh","12 March 2019","As much as I love Marvel movies, their single-character movies can feel a little dull and uninteresting in comparison to the big tentpoles. Sure, seeing Nick Fury with two eyes and hair in the 90s was something to look forward to, but without a prior connection to Captain Marvel herself, it was hard for me to get uncomfortably overhyped.And in some ways Captain Marvel is a victim of Marvel's single-character movies. We've come so far into the franchise now that going back to see the origin of yet another hero and how/why they're relevant just doesn't seem as enthralling any more. That said, Marvel's molasses of average movies is still pretty damn high, especially when compared to other blockbusters and franchises around at the moment, and Captain Marvel is also no exception there. There's very little to hate.Vers is a Kree warrior with the unusual ability to shoot photon blasts from her fists. She's wrapped up in the Skrull/Kree war (the Skrulls being a race of shapeshifters), but is haunted of dreams of another life. While by the strictest definition, Captain Marvel is not an origin story, it still kind of is. While she has her powers from the movie's opening, it's still about her discovering who she is and what she's really capable of. Instead of starting at the beginning of her journey, her origin is instead told in flashbacks that are slowly revealed, expanded upon, and explained as the movie goes on. It's a good way of establishing her origin, and crafting a story around it, while also tying it into her character development as the movie goes along. It creates twists and turns that you don't see coming, re-ordering the general structure of a typical origin story. And I like anything that's different and changes things up, so thumbs up there.Unfortunately Captain Marvel herself is outshone by almost every other character in the movie. Yes, her determination and quest for answers are charming and carry the entire movie, but it's characters like a younger, more cheerful Nick Fury and an endearingly comical Talos who are responsible for making the movie as captivating to watch as it is. Samuel L Jackson is clearly having a lot of fun here, and like every one of his roles, he gives it his all, including being able to act like a guy in his forties instead of his seventies. The phenomenal make-up and CG to make him look younger were only one ingredient in how convincingly younger he appeared. Ben Mendelsohn honestly kind of steals the show as the Skrull leader, managing to carefully toe the line between menacing and goofy. They lean in to how potentially silly green, pointy-eared aliens who can shapeshift are, and use that to poke fun, while also not diminishing how deadly their abilities can be. Mendelsohn shows once again how capable an actor he really is.Talking of the humour, this is the freshest it's been in a while. Not once did it undercut more dramatic moments, feel forced in, or just be too much for its own good. Brie Larson's comedy bone comes out full force, and while she doesn't quite manage to encapsulate the jokiness of Tony Stark, she's pretty close. Another movie or two and she'll ease right into it. Another big source of comedy is the interactions between humans and aliens, and their worlds and cultures colliding. Goose the Flerken is a big example of this; adorable kitty cat? Or dangerous and unpredictable monster? Both outcomes are hilarious.Marvel has never been particularly great with their music, and Captain Marvel attempts to eschew that in the same way Guardians did, but without the same panazz. We get a whole album's worth of female-led 90's classics, from No Doubt and Garbage to TLC and Salt-N-Pepa. They do give the film's it own sonic identity and harkens back to the era, however some of the uses, particularly in the third act, feel misplaced. Come As You Are by Nirvana is used at one point, and lyrically it fits quite well with what's going on, but musically it comes out of nowhere and doesn't match the tone of the surrounding scenes whatsoever. Just A Girl by No Doubt is also a far cry from action scene music, and yet there it is bursting in over the top of a critical sequence of Captain Marvel kicking names and taking ass.Captain Marvel is by no means a bad movie. As a blockbuster goes it's one of the best you can get, but as a Marvel movie - thanks to the high quality across the board - it falls somewhere in the middle. It's nowhere near as good as Infinity War, Guardians, Winter Soldier, or Civil War, but it's also nowhere near as bad as Thor 2 or Iron Man 3. As far as female-lead superhero movies, I'd say Captain Marvel absolutely beats out Wonder Woman. I give it a flawed 8/10.P.S. I still think Danver's Ms. Marvel costume had the far superior colour scheme, and I wish they'd kept it. Black and gold with a red sash is unique in the superhero sphere. Instead they doubled down on her mediocrity by making her red and blue just like everyone else. The leotard and prostitute boots were too much, I agree, but that colour scheme (and the sash) was just too good to completely abandon. They even cycle through the black and gold scheme on her Kree uniform and it looks SO GOOD. Why tease me Marvel? Why?","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","kjproulx","9 March 2019","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been an impressive run of films, whether you have loved every one of them or not. In my opinion, ranging from mediocre to fantastic, this franchise has had its ups and downs like any, but nothing has really been a huge misstep, as producer Kevin Feige has been steering this ship in a safe direction from start to finish. Captain Marvel is the latest introduction to a character in this franchise and while it may not rank among the best films this franchise has had to offer thus far, it's a welcome addition to the family, so to speak.Following Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) as she discovers her past and learns who she used to be on Earth, a relationship forms between her and a few familiar faces from Shield, mainly in Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). With a war between the two races of Kree and Skrulls, Carol finds herself caught in the middle of it all, while also discovering her past along the way. Filled with enough energy to keep you engaged from start to finish, this is a breezy addition to the franchise as a whole. Sadly, I don't feel that this film explored any of the characters enough and it really did feel like a stepping stone for a larger story to be told in the future.Feeling very much like the early days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with movies like Thor or Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain Marvel has a very solid introduction to this universe, but there's a lot of room to improve. Brie Larson delivers a solid performance here and I look forward to seeing more from this character in future instalments, but I wasn't blown away by any means. Aside from an interesting backstory, she really isn't given anything to do and almost seems unbeatable, which is kind of a draw-back for future stakes that may arise. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson's chemistry is easily the biggest highlight of this film and will probably keep even the uninterested fans entertained.Captain Marvel gets off to a very messy start throughout the first 20 minutes. It finds its footing very fast, but I must admit that I was very worried when the movie first began. The way her past is quickly thrown in and jumbled around to set-up the rest of the film felt a little rushed, but the movie does slow down to a nice pace. It's not that I have a lot to complain about here, but there truly wasn't anything that wowed me about this film, which was disappointing, considering it's the final film that leads into the culmination of the last ten years with Avengers: Endgame.In the end, Captain Marvel doesn't do a whole lot to dazzle, but it works very well as a standalone origin for this character. I enjoyed myself quite a bit, but this formula has been done over and over again throughout the course of these 21 films and although the formula works, I feel something new has to be done once Avengers: Endgame brings this first segment of this universe to a close. I had a lot of fun with Captain Marvel, but it's by no means a great movie. I definitely recommend it to fans of this franchise (who will be the most impacted from it) and to those who are simply looking for a fun superhero flick. Captain Marvel delivered for me, but there was a lot that could have been improved upon.","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","Ibrakeforufos","10 March 2019","I thought it'd be a good movie, but it was way better than I expected. I'm picky, and it was certainly in my top 3 favorite marvel movies (but I love aviation.) I thought the space battles were on par with Star Wars Episode 7 (better than guardians) and the story had lots of depth. It brought back memories and parallels with ""The Rocketeer"". Cookie cutter Marvel? Maybe. Origin stories always are ""cookie cutter"". This one was by far out of the norm though. Brie Larson was great! Funny but not cocky. Minimal feminist undertones (for those complaining). Let's face it, life sucked for the first female pilots and still sort of does.I honestly overlooked the gender and thought she was a total badass regardless of gender. Better than the Wonder-woman and the English speaking German supporting characters. The best part is that her story is an underdog story, and it has a character that channels her weakness into a strength. Sort of something most normies will relate to.","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","fcharette1969","10 March 2019","Where should I start? Captain Marvel gives us an all powerful being who is still very much human, especially in the fact that she doesn't know the extent of her own limits. Carol Denver's is strong, fierce, a perfect female role model while at the same time showing us that her emotions are part of what makes her who she is.Goose is a riot who deserves his own movie, but I digress. Captain Marvel manages to keep a light-hearted approach to some very serious issues. Betrayal and mental abuse are only a few of the issues addressed on a much deeper level, something that I understand will turn some viewers off as this requires them to actually think about what they have seen or heard.This movie is not an orgy of action and battle scenes. It is not a linear story that can be followed while half asleep. It is a remarkable piece if writing and acting that takes the origin of the character to a whole new level. We understand her motivation, her reasoning and learn in the process that there is no such thing as a black or white universe.Captain Marvel is a force to be feared and respected. A woman who proves to anyone in her way that she can dish it out better than anyone else, all while remaining caring towards others.Whatever the final say will be of those who cannot look beyond the multi-layer story, this movie will be for me a must show to my girls. No matter who tells them ""you can't"", I hope that this movie will show them that with strength and determination, they will in the end prove them all wrong.","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","doomprodigy","12 March 2019","I was not sure what to expect going into this movie. I took my daughter in for her 7th Birthday and she was pretty unsure what to expect too, still riding the wave of Gal Gadots Wonder Woman.We sat down and immediately she recognised the short but sweet tribute to Stan Lee, I did share a tear for him... again.The movie itself is really well paced and is serious enough to be believable and adult but also funny and vividly colourful for the kids.The characters were exciting and different and it felt like we were getting a glimpse into the future of the MCU.The story itself was great, we loved it. It wasnt too much and introduced the character well. The twist was unexpected but then I didnt go into the movie looking for faults.We thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I am glad they did this before they release a really unnecessary Black Widow movie.The post credit scenes were also great and really tied everything together, much like the scene at the end of Black Panther, this movie could easily serve as a stand alone or part of the bigger picture movie.Really enjoyable and fun and fresh.","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","moskeman","13 March 2019","First of all, after reading so many bad reviews here without any facts or explanation why is movie so bad, made me even more eager to see the movie and enjoy, cause Marvel never dissapointed me so far. The worst Marvel movie would be the best in DCEU. And I don't hate DCEU, I feel sorry that they can get even close to Marvel, but to write so many hateful and wrong reviews is just sad. This one is definitely not the best MCU movie, but it is very good and just another hero introduction movie. You can see that Brie Larson didn't do anything similar in her career, but I find her like a really good choice for Captain Marvel. MCU needs to evolve and Captain Marvel is just that. I can't even imagine how much she evolved for all these years away from Earth, but she'll definitely be one of the main characters in Avengers End Game. Don't get discouraged with all these bad reviews, cause they are all fake. Can't wait to see it again.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","AngelsAngel","9 March 2019","First of all, anyone who says this movie is too political are only the people who think it is a radical political statement to have a female led superhero movie. Because it's not! It's a fun, hilarious sci-fi movie with a great cast and great story! There's no politics in sight! None that should affect you! You know what movies are political? Literally almost every other superhero movie! I mean have you ever seen an X-Men film? How about Captain America? Ring a bell?This movie is filled with trademark Marvel humour, action, 90s nostalgia, a few great twists and just plenty of all around fun scenes! If you like any other Marvel movies, you should like this.This is not only a great female superhero movie, it's a great superhero movie, period. If you're going to hate it just to hate it without seeing it? Go hug a cactus. Because it is on the same amazing level of quality as every other Marvel movie and deserves at least a chance. I'll admit, I wasn't that hyped to see it at first, but now after seeing it, I am so hyped to recommend it!","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","veriity","9 March 2019","You know, I saw the bad reviews and I was apprehensive.Then I thought, oh wait, I'm a GIRL and I watch what I want and I can make up my own damned mind.And that's what I did.First, Brie is entering the Marvel/Disney Universe late. Captain Mar-Vell didn't. The Kree didn't and the Universal war didn't. I mean, seriously. Why all the bashing? Oh wait. Brie doesn't have a penis. That's the Start and the stop of this movie bashing.Second, every time you think there's a crisis in the Marvel universe; there's something much MUCH bigger going on across more Multiverses. Another whole layer of things going on that makes what happened in the our nine realms look tiny.Just keep that in mind.Third, the movie just rocks. She's knocked down, kidnapped, brainwashed and told everything is just as it isn't. (Of course, this is also modified a bit because we don't want the movie to be 900 hours long) The important part is, she's off doing something so important that our little piece of the Multiverse is on a PAGER far, buried in her jacket. Because we're literally just that unimportant in the Multiverse scale.Her recovering her memories and putting it altogether before we get to the fact that she is the living Tesseract is just phenomenal.So wake up boys. Put on your big boy's pants and step aside. Yes, women can be heroes too.","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","valentinabonomelli","24 April 2019","I won't comment on all the dreadful reviews, as everyone has its own taste.
But as a young woman who loves movies and superheroes, I loved it. Unlike what many on here said, I stepped out of the cinema with a sense of fulfillment and purpose, feeling inspired - Captain Marvel is a strong woman that can and should be an example for women to come. It might not be a faithful-to-the-comics movie (I wouldn't know as I haven't read them) - and on that note I would understand why many disliked it. But it's certainly VERY far from deserving a 1 out of 10 - disliking and irrationally hating are two different things. Taken as a movie of its own, as a single part of the MCU, I think it's great. It's funny and carries the 2hrs of lenght extremely well (time literally flies). It has an interesting and fairly captivating story and yes, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a goddamn good Marvel movie.
Most people do not understand the importance of seeing a female super hero not being sexualised for once, and saying ""I have nothing to prove to you"".
Just watch it without getting biased by the nonsensical hate and make your own judgment.","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","baduffe","10 March 2019","This is only the second movie I wanted to review, and the reason I wanted to review it couldn't be more different than the first (Star Wars Last Jedi, which was terrible). I went into the theater with a hope that all of the negative reviews and speculation would be wrong, that the always solid MCU movies wouldn't let me down, and they didn't. All of the super negative far right and far left ""reviewers"" who wanted the movie to be something it isn't, were proven wrong. It's not a man hating movie, far from it, it's an entertaining buddy picture, with a super powerful being and a somewhat cynical federal agent who's been riding a desk for too many years. It's a very good movie that I felt might be getting a bad rep from people leaving one star reviews that haven't even seen it. Go see it, and make your own decision about it, and as always wait through the credits, two good scenes hiding in there.","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","astephanie-chamberlain","1 June 2019","I mostly came here to explain that not all people who rate a movie title on IMDB actually write a review. So you can't calculate the average score by only reading through the reviews. We can't actually calculate an average ourselves since we don't have access to all reviews but only to the written ones; only IMDB's algorithms would be able to do that calculation. I for one did enjoy the whole plot and the intrigue I felt throughout the movie, and also the different origins that were revealed. I understand and agree with the opinion that the character of Carol Danvers is maybe just not that likeable. She comes off as a bit cocky, at times, and unidimensional. Her character isn't as developed as I would have liked. Despite this, I did enjoy the plot and origin stories, hence my rating.","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","BoshArrow","8 March 2019","I just can't understand the hate towards this nice movie. Yes, it's far from Infinity War, but I feel it's still among top 10 in the MCU. Brie Larson is gorgeus, she did her best and I believe she will fit perfectly in the upcoming movies.
Action scenes on highest level, interesting plot and touching score - Marvel soundtracks continually improve and I think this one is great as well.
'Captain Marvel' is maybe the first movie in which you can actually see more from Nick Fury and understand his vital role for the MCU. Samuel L. Jackson does a decent job and he has a strong supporting role.
Well, I have to say something about the villains in this film - just expect something similar to what happened in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2'.Nice plot twists, interesting investigation and awesome final fight. Don't expect a punching contest like in 'Civil War' or a clever solution like in 'Doctor Strange' - the final battle could be compared to a marvellous inspiration like in 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. The bad guys were actually very interesting and delivered entertainment.
I think 9/10 is fair, 'Captain Marvel' is way better than 'Thor: The Dark World' or 'Ant-man'.","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","prafullasrivastav","10 March 2019","Direction: Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck duo best known for their collaborations on Half Nelson , Sugar , It's Kind of a Funny Story and Mississippi Grind .However this time. they came together for the biggest mission of their life: Captain Marvel (The Most Powerful Avenger).
Performance: Room fame Brie Larson has played role which is larger than life. She was fighter, savior and super hero in single flick. Samuel L Jackson has done good job as a supporting role. Jude Law was impressive in small role. Ben Mendelsohn surprised the audience with his side.
Script: We must appreciate the efforts of director duo along with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve. They have brilliantly linked many mystery in one go. e.g. How Marvel, Avengers words came into existence and why Fury has used Pager in infinity war. They have also mentioned the world at the era of 1990s with slow internet speed. Most unique thing was the way to give tribute to Stan Lee.
Dialogues: Conversion between Brie and Jackson's added fun in the script. Lashana and Brie 's conversation was emotional one.
Box-Office: After opening with 12.75 crores in India, it took another jump on day 2 as it has earned 13.75. It means that it will earn more on Sunday. It will be interesting watch whether it will cross 100 crores mark at Indian Box-Office.

"Captain Marvel","Mtoomb","10 March 2019","THIS is how you do a female ""superhero"" movie. First of all, it's not even a ""superhero"" movie, it's a sci-fi action film that just so happens to take place in the Marvel MCU. More along the lines of Guardians of the Galaxy. In fact, this was funnier than GoG, Chris Pratt's schtick is getting stale.And how friggin amazing is it that actors don't have to worry about being old anymore? (lol) They can just put them in the computer and viola, digital de-aging! I knew Sam Jackson would steal the show, but I did not know that a 1998 Sam Jackson would. I grew up in the 80s/90s, I graduated in 94, this movie does for the 90s what Stranger Things did for the 80s. It makes me yearn for a simpler time when not everything was ""smart"" yet.I digress. Brie was great, the story wasn't too cookie cutter, and the best Marvel special effects yet. I really liked the plot, a soldier on the wrong side of the war is a classic, and it's done well.On a personal note, this movie friggin rocked. To see my kids faces while they watched, and all the other girls in the theater, it almost brought me to tears. It has such a good message.

"Captain Marvel","fernandoschiavi","28 March 2020","About to end its phase 3 with an ""Ultimatum"", one of the most awaited films of the last decades, Marvel still finds time to introduce new and important characters in its shared universe. In the comics, Carol Danvers, Captain Marvel, debuted in the Silver Age of American comics. The character was featured in a solo series in the late 1970s, before associating with the superhero teams, The Avengers and X-Men, the character was created by screenwriter Roy Thomas and designer Gene Colan. Danvers first appeared as an officer in the United States Air Force and a colleague of superhero kree Mar-Vell in Marvel Super-Heroes # 13 (March 1968). In recent times, Danvers has been labeled ""Marvel's greatest heroine"" and ""possibly"" most powerful Marvel Avengers member. ""
In theaters, ""Captain Marvel"", in addition to being the first Marvel film starring a heroine, is the bridge between ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and the long-awaited ""Avengers: Ultimatum"". Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, and written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet, it stars Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Lashanna Lynch, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Mckenna Grace, Clark Gregg and Jude Law. takes us takes us to before all the other MCU features (except for Captain America: The First Avenger). In 1995, the story follows Danvers when she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien worlds, borrowing elements from screenplay writer Roy Kree-Skrull (1971). Thomas.
For starters, the publisher's homage to his legendary comic artist Stan Lee stands out, putting him in the place of the characters he created in the opening animation of Marvel Studios. Lee passed away in late 2018 and, before that, he even recorded his famous participation in the film, appearing in the scene where the heroine hunts a Skrull in the subway.
Exploring flashes of the past very well, the heroine tries to discover more about her own past, as well as understand and master her powers. Finally, the heroine manages to show a more human facet to the public through the partnership with Nick Fury that generates several situations of comedy that gives lightness to the war by showing it through Fury's still innocent eyes, and also with Maria Rambeau (Lashanna Lynch), which is the heroine's great connection to her past. It is in Maria's memories the memory of facing prejudices as pilots and in the support for the creation of little Monica Rambeau (Akira Akbar). But there are other characters who are doing very well and steal all the scenes they participate in: Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and the cat Goose. Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and Dr. Wendy Lawson / Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) are good assistants.
Because it is a film that takes place decades ago, it is curious to see several of the characters that we get used to accompany, in another moment of life. Ronan the Accuser, who first appeared as the great villain of Guardians of the Galaxy and a lackey for Thanos, appears as the leader of an elite Kree force, the Accusers; Korath is just a Kree soldier; Agent Coulson appears as a young and promising agent and the main highlight is Nick Fury. At the time, he was an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. who, after years as a spy, worked outside the field looking for ways to protect the Earth. He is still inexperienced and had no knowledge of intergalactic issues, let alone superpowered beings. Jackson and Gregg - who, among others, reprise their roles in previous MCU films - were digitally rejuvenated in post-production to reflect the setting of the film in the 90s. And the result couldn't be better: they are of an absurd quality, bordering on the perfection.
One of the main aspects of the feature is the infinity of references not only in relation to the stories of the publisher's comics, but also in the pop culture of the 80s and 90s, where the story predominantly takes place. After escaping the Skrulls, Carol Danvers falls to Earth inside a Blockbuster video store. As the feature takes place in the 1990s, it is possible to see references to classics such as Hook: The Return of the Captain Hook (1991), Babe, the Rough Piggy (1995), True Lies (1994), in addition to The Elected: Where the Future Begins (1983). The musical references are also present, with several references of bands from the 80's and early 90's. She appears with a Guns N 'Roses T-shirt - and finds a ticket to the group's concert, a Bush poster appears when she is on the pay phone, Nine Inch Nails, Heart t-shirts appear, a Smashing Pumpkins poster and even a reference to grunge in the heroine's civilian outfits.
Another reference is Captain Marvel's cat, which in the comics is called Chewie in a reference to Star Wars. In cinema, however, Marvel chose to call him Goose, a direct reference to Anthony Edwards' character in Top Gun: Untamed Aces. It is not, however, a conventional feline. Goose arrived on Earth with Mar-Vell and is an alien of the Flerken race, with internal tentacles and the ability to swallow objects as powerful as the Tesseract. In comics, the breed also has the ability to harbor dimensions within itself, being able to teleport from place to place, in addition to laying numerous eggs. In the film, aware of the threat of Flerken, the Kree gag the creature, in a moment inspired directly by the comics. The film also reveals how Nick Fury lost his eye - a scratch from Goose, and how theories emerged about how he came to use his famous eye patch, with Fury insisting on feeding the aura of mystery around the wound. There is also the fact that Fury was inspired by Danvers to propose to S.H.I.E.L.D. recruiting exceptional individuals to defend the Earth together from unconventional threats, and when he discovers that Danvers was codenamed ""Avenger"" in the Air Force, he names this protocol ""Avengers Initiative"".
Although the film highlights the friend Maria Rambeau, we must pay attention to her daughter. Monica Rambeau in the comics is one of the most powerful heroines in the Marvel Universe, having even been the first woman to use the name Captain Marvel. In 1982, at Amazing Spider-Man Annual # 16, Marvel introduced Monica Rambeau at the hands of Roger Stern and John Romita Jr. as a New Orleans police officer who has the power to transform into any form of energy. As Captain Marvel, she was a member of the Avengers and even led the team. Then he adopted the name Photon (which in the film appears as Maria's nickname in the air force, as shown in the photo above), Pulsar and currently serves as Spectrum. As the film takes place in the 90s, Mônica is around 30 years old in the present line of the MCU.
However, the film is not just a nostalgic trip and it has different points. Perhaps due to their lack of experience in running large blockbusters, the duo of directors are unable to shoot action scenes that look spectacular. The prevalence of more closed plans and not so imposing scenarios, fail to give the scenes greater proportions as they should. The feeling is that in the hands of another director, the scenes could be reimagined in the way that worked best on the big screen. In addition to not being grandiose, the scenes are scarce, being almost all restricted to the final act of the story, and were also not helped in many moments by the visual effects team. In several scenes, it is possible to notice the use of CGI in the composition of scenarios, giving an air of artificiality, especially in the final stretch when the heroine fights aerial fights with her powers developed.
The rhythm of the film is a problem with the plot starting relatively at a slower pace, taking time to explain the central conflict - deeper than it appears - and, of course, the protagonist's role in this story. So, gradually, Captain Marvel gains a more intense cadence and it is in her arrival on Earth that the film actually begins to take a more defined form. There is also the issue of the Skrull-Kree war, which is summed up in a very simplistic and incoherent way. We have a little war. In the film, everything is very predictable. From the beginning, one feels that nothing is as it seems, and the real villains can be identified with a mere guessing exercise. However, it is the lack of personality of the antagonists, generic in their plans and worldview, that damage the plot more deeply. Seeing this weak antagonism after figures like Killmonger and especially Thanos is, to say the least, something that lowers the experience to a B or C series within this recent crop.
Long before she was Captain Marvel, Carol was a fearless girl finding her place in a world of men. As a human, she has flaws, but whenever she fell, she got up, tried herself and got everything she wanted. A child, a teenager, a young adult. The transformation into Kree would be the starting point for the character, if her entire past no longer assumed a hero's journey. The feminist subtext, although well implemented, does not reach the depth that racial and cultural themes gained in the film of the hero of Wakanda. And you don't even have to reach it. Issues can be raised for discussion without becoming flags blindly defended by a particular group. Overall, the film follows the late Marvel formula and does not take chances, does not innovate and does not dare, but delivers a fun, nostalgic result and a character that will certainly be one of the leaders of The Avengers in the next films!","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","kodenkan","20 July 2019","Can't imagine what expectations some people have to rate this a 1! The acting is first-rate and dialog crisp but not world-class, and Jackson and Larson lead the not-too-complex story well, and Lynch did a wonderful job as a hard-charging pilot.It isn't Gone with the Wind nor is it meant to be. But it's fun, Brie is cute, Jackson plays a hapless victim to the strong woman hilariously, the humor is unexpected and timed well, the special effects are as good as they get, and it tied in perfectly with the Marvel Universe. I thought it was a more enjoyable waste of time than most entertainment today.","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","mattpeerless-376-865613","9 March 2019","There are many reviews on here which criticise the lack of spectacle, poor writing, and predictability of this film, however I cannot help feel they're missing the point. We all knew this was 2 things: a setup for Endgame, and Marvel's attempt at a successful lead in answer to DC's Wonder Woman.
In the first, it succeeds. I'm excited to see how Captain Marvel helps solve the problem leftover from Infinity War.
In the second however, it exceeded my expectations entirely. The true beauty of this film is that it's a film made with a feminist agenda by someone who doesn't actually seem to hate men. It's about empowering women by virtue of their own ability; showing what they can achieve simply by themselves, not by patronising them with special treatment.
It also succeeds in showcasing a female superhero without feeling the need to make her a sex symbol in a short skirt/using gratuitous shots of her bottom. Brie Larson looks great throughout, but at no point did I ever feel that was a focus.
Full disclosure - I am a man. If I ever have a daughter, I want films like this to inspire her.","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","CubsandCulture","9 March 2019","At this point in the MCU it is rather hard to find surprises. Likewise, origin stories are often very rote and formulaic. That is somewhat true in this film but the decision to set the film in the 90's rather helps. Likewise, the decision to the make the film sort of a origin story for Fury was a good idea. The 90's nostalgia coupled with seeing how the pieces of the MCU fit into this film really liven up this story. I was fond of how the various reveals subverted the expectations. With an antagonist that can be anyone it was great to see how many characters weren't what they initially seemed. Overall, the story is a solid origin tale that fits in with Iron Man, Dr. Strange, the 1st Captain America etc. And hold its own. There are few choice barbs at sexism that are great and adds to the female empowerment of the film in a tasteful way.The acting is quite good. Mendelson plays Talos with relish. He channels the pathos of the character quite well; he was a great choice to play a character that has the audience guessing. Law plays the pseudo-love interest and mentor quite well. His final scene hits the correct note of vindictive and pathetic. It is about time Law was in the MCU. I hope his character remains. Larson plays Captain Marvel with a tom boyish charm but also as a woman who won't suffer fools. I think Larson handles the character's earnestness about as well as one could. Her performance is committed and sincere.However, Captain Marvel, the character, suffers from a Superman problem. The character is as overpowered as Superman and worse as earnest. This characterization is somewhat bland and dramatically flat. But it is refreshing to have such sincerity in a character. I am not sure how future stories can handle this to make the story engaging. The conflict in this film is just enough to up end this problem while watching but I am not sure if the character works beyond wish fulfillment.It is really the detail that make this film very good. That the theme of things aren't what the seem being forwarded by Goose's running gag is a good example. Or how staples of the 90's-grunge, blockbuster, fresh prince etc.-are referenced in a natural way really sell the film.This film fits comfortably within Marvel's average output. It is not the highs of Black Panther, Winter Soldier. But it isn't the lows of the Incredible Hulk, Age of Ultron.EDIT: Enough cannot be said of Fury's and Danvers' chemistry. Re-watching the film today it struck me as a really good buddy-""cop"" film as well as an origin story. Jackson and Lawson play off each other very well and if nothing else the film is worth seeing for this relationship.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","Eli_Elvis","2 April 2019","Bad Directing, writing, and acting. This is why you don't give a Rom/Com writer/Director a 100+ million action franchise.

"Captain Marvel","gavinp9","9 March 2019","'Captain Marvel' builds the bridge between 'Avengers: Infinity War' and 'Avengers: Endgame' and does a good job of it. Most of the film works well as the standalone origin story of Carol Danvers (Larson), as she pieces together her past. Starting with her already on the Kree (the blue aliens, as seen in 'Guardians of the Galaxy') home world is smart and saves dealing with the whole aliens on Earth thing. Vers is being trained by Yon-Rogg (Law) and has almost no memory her life on Earth, save some snippets of Lawson (Bening) and Maria (Lynch).After Carol ends up back on Earth, she starts to unravel the mystery of who she is, with the help of Nick Fury (Jackson) and (to a lesser degree) Coulson (Gregg). She reunites with Maria and deciphers that they both used to be pilots - which leads to some good jet battles later on! The main plot though is that Carol is caught in the middle of an intergalactic war between the Kree and the Skrulls (the green aliens, shapeshifters). Talos (Mendelsohn) is a Skrull and does a great job - great to hear his Aussie accent when he's in Skrull form! Ronan (Pace) is back for some scenes, but the other Kree offsiders don't have that much to do.There's still a bit of jigsaw-piecing-together going on (stay for the end credit scene), but when Larson and Jackson are on screen, it's a very solid action/adventure film. There was more laughs than I was expecting, especially with the ""flerken""! It's not 'Thor: Ragnarok', but the 90s film and music references are fun to see/hear. Great to watch Carol's powers develop and the ""twist"" just after halfway through. It's not too long and there's under seven weeks until 'Avengers: Endgame' (likely to be the highest-grossing film ever).","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","bogdanbalostin","1 June 2019","It's nothing special in the large scale of things.I've finally seen this movie, after Avengers: Infinity War because I didn't feel I'll miss anything and I was right. There are some stakes there but there are not big because you obviously know Earth will be fine and Captain Marvel will kick ass even if she's not even trying.So, the thing is Marvel has continuously upped their game, so we (or I) expect each movie to be better than the previous one. This one is way better than the first Marvel movies (except the first Iron-man I was bored to tears at most of the Marvel movies, but slowly they got better and better).What I'm saying this movie is not bad at all but suffers because the heroine is invincible. The acting is perfect (yes, I think Brie Larson fits Captain Marvel, don't listen to the negative opinions), I'm so glad we got to see a lot more of Nick Fury (don't call him Nick), and they even added some emotional twists that I really loved to see more in superhero movies.It's a good movie that should have been part of Marvel Phase 4 and have bigger stakes. Maybe that's a job for a sequel. And with Captain Marvel, the stakes should be huge.","9/10"

Haters hated black panther because it was filled with black people but the movie was set in africa and now, hater hate captain marvel because it has a female lead and its filled with strong women.

First of all I found it very amusing, entertaining and AWESOME!
NOT because it's #girlpower but because of the storyline. And I understand now why Fury has that 'pirate cover' on his eye. I really liked the movie and I recommend anyone who follows/like MCU movies to watch it. If you're a fan even better. But now I am confused and intrigued to know if Carol Danvers is related to the Danvers sisters somehow.

"Captain Marvel","richwagener","29 June 2019","I'm a 53 year old life long Marvel fan who bought Ms. Marvel #1 off the newsstand back in the 70s. Once Mar-Vell died in ""The Death of Captain Marvel"", the company struggled to fill the void and maintain the name. So I was really glad when, a few years ago, Carol Danvers got the upgrade in the comics. I just rewatched the film this morning and I still found it moving and compelling. Technically, it's a quality Marvel film. The CGI gets slightly over ambitious in the finale. However, there is absolutely no justification for the low ratings certain ""accounts"" are giving this film except as some kind of weird anti-feminist statement. Some are talking about some kind of conspiracy relating to the IMDB ratings. I think the ""conspiracy"" is more likely trolls with multiple accounts dragging this film's rating far lower than it actually is.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","chrisgavidia","9 March 2019","This film doesn't deserve as much backlash as it's getting from online reviewers....however I can understand the negativity slightly. It did feel like Disney was trying really hard to develop a strong female character using a basic story formula with a slight narrative twist . They had a target audience they were trying to reach and bring into the customer fold to increase revenue for their very well structured MCU and also appear progressive at the same time.Where Gal Gadot succeeded as being a likable heroine with Wonder Woman you cared about and pulled for, Brie Larsons protrayal falls slightly below Gadots unfortunately. Larsons personality resonates and connected with the audience in some scenes, but in others felt very wooden. The producers of Captain Marvel had clear goals they were probably aiming to make with this film to fit into the great whole of the MCU.With all of that said this is still a very entertaining movie and worth seeing with a plot that keeps you wanting to see the next scene and the first tent pole film of 2019 . The interaction between Fury and Carol helps this film significantly and of course the set pieces were very solid.Don't go in expecting a Wonder Woman type film. Set your expectations to what you thought before Ant-Man and Captain America the First Avenger. In no way is this a Fantastic Four or Green Lantern or Iron Man 3 story bad or polarizing as The Last Jedi but the film is a middle of the road MCU film that is worth seeing that falls in with Age of Ultron and Dr. Strange. For sure check it out atleast once.","10/10"

"Captain Marvel","CinemaClown","16 March 2019","Marvel Studios' first female-led entry features one of their strongest avengers in one of their weakest film so far, for Captain Marvel simply fails to realise its true potential and wasn't even aware of what was up for grabs here. Its action is seldom impressive, storytelling is utterly basic, predictable & bereft of surprises, and some key moments are executed in a rather lacklustre fashion. In short, this isn't the origin story that the most powerful superhero in Marvel faction deserves.","6/10"
"Captain Marvel","deeptisharma-13839","9 March 2019","Is this a superhero movie? Yes. Is this a great superhero movie? YES. Dont expect it to blow your lid off bcoz you see some cool intergalactic fights (you do see action, which is well choreographed, but leave that aside). What makes this movie a true standout is:
1. Stan Lee's last signature cameo
2. Strong characters - well fleshed out within the limitations of a 2 hour feature
3. Doesn't follow the usual tropes of pleasing male gaze (unfortunately inviting trolls)
4. Strong message - no sexism, strong female character who is unapologetic (men may view it as arrogant), message about perseverance well delivered, strong (and yet not an infallible) role model for little girls, and most importantly - not to judge a book by its cover - which impressed me the most and is the biggest plot twist (hard to say more without giving it away), so go watch it.
Its not a female superhero movie, it is a superhero movie with a strong message, dry humor done right, some great 90s music, and brilliant acting!","10/10"

"Captain Marvel","pruz-55801","11 March 2019","Wow! Just wow! I (like everyone else) was debating to see captain marvel, but when I saw the reviews it turned me off. They said ""it shoved feminism down your throat!"" They said ""bad acting!"" They said ""goose is the only good thing about this movie!"" And I believed them. But thank god I had the sense to see it anyways! Going into the theater I was like ""ok show me you what you got marvel"" and they proved me dead wrong!! I don't even know where to begin I am at a literal list for words as there were TOO MANY THINGS GOOD ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!! (I'm not joking when a friend asked ""how was the movie?"" I dididnt know how to properly explain this great piece of entertainment) First of all to clear the air: THIS IS NOT A FEMINIST MOVIE! I repeat This is not a feminist movie! (Btw I am a pure conservative) The media blew this movie way out of proportion about the feminist message. Yes of course there were very subtle hints of it but it's not revolutionary as a feminist piece of art (just because it's has a female lead doesn't make it a feminist legend) The movie start to finish kept me on edge with great story telling and plot twists. Another's thing people are complaing about is braie larson's acting they say she is too bland, but thats the point! HER CHARACTER IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EMOTIONAL! She was actually playing her part perfect. Her character is very reserved and withdrawn to strangers and gradually you see her develop. Samuel L. Jackson was also great ( the secod act of the movie feels like a buddy-cop movie) To end off as the move came to a close the entire theater gave a standing ovation! The atmosphere was full of surprise people were basically saying ""Hey I didn't know it was this good!"" Do yourself a favor, ignore the comments, watch the movie , and decide for yourself what you think about it!","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","kermitkid","30 March 2020","This is a perfect example of horrible marketing for a good movie. I wasn't too impressed with the trailers. They were kind of bland. I went into this with my expectations checked at the door, and this movie was above average. It wasn't as boring and uninteresting as the trailers led me to believe, but it still has faults. For an MCU movie, it's average, and for a movie it's above average. The main problem was it tried to hard to be another 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie, but without the risks. ""Guardians"" was a gamble. (A movie about a talking raccoon and a tree?! Marvel has lost their minds!). It tries to capture the wonder of a sci-fi movie, but plays it too safe. There were many factors that I felt didn't go as far as they could have. The plot is pretty paint-by-numbers as well. This movie 'borrows' too much from other films. It didn't feel enough like it's own thing. There were some amusing moments, and one in particular that got a huge laugh out of me, but the film played it too safe. The CGI is pretty impressive. I couldn't tell that the aliens in the movie were CGI. However, when there are scenes of characters flying, it definitely looks CGI, and cheap CGI at that. (Think ""video game trailer."") Larson's acting is not as wooden as the trailers would lead you to believe (most of the time anyway), nor is the character of Captain Marvel as narcissistic and rude as the trailers made her seem. She's nowhere close to my favorite MCU character, but I wouldn't mind seeing her return. I don't know what most of Hollywood has against Ben Mendelssohn's natural accent. Mendelssohn is a terrific actor, but in movies like ""Ready Player One"" and this one where they make him do an American accent, it sounds fake, and is distracting. And no, this movie is not a 2 hour lecture on feminism. Contrary to the marketing, Captain Marvel doesn't put down the male characters (at least not unprovoked.) This movie actually can be enjoyed by anyone. Marvel needs to re-evaluate their marketing team.
Grade: B 8/10 3.5/5 stars","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","RahulM007","10 March 2019","Captain Marvel has one of the best origin stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Granted, it is no where near as good as the origin story of Black Panther which was purely amazing and absolutely flawless. I loved every single scene of the movie and was glued to the screen from start to finish. The phenomenal action scenes, light humor, special effects, dialogue and Brie Larson's acting all make this movie worth your time.It answered a huge question regarding Nick Fury of how he lost his eye. The scene where this happens was not traditional nor obvious. As a matter of fact, Agent Fury lost his eye at the end of the colossal intergalactic fight scene. He trusted Goose the Cat and thought it was harmless, but his assumptions were so wrong. Apparently the cat is from another planet and devours anything it does not like or makes them feel insecure. Agent Fury held the cat and it scratched his eye out. The scene is quite humorous and one of the best scenes in the entire movie.Captain Marvel has two post credit scenes (a mid and end credits scene) that take place in the past and present. The first one takes place after the events of Infinity war with the surviving members of the Avengers deciphering the message Agent Fury sent after he turned into dust. The scene ends with Captain Marvel showing up and asks Where's Fury?. While the second one takes place in the past and features Goose the Cat trying to spit out the Tesseract. Both of these scenes especially the first one puts me in a nostalgic mood and gets me even more excited for Avengers: Endgame.The movie tried to tell the origin story of Captain Marvel in an exciting and unique way and in my opinion it delivered. I admit that some scenes were confusing, but that does not hinder the fact that Captain Marvel is one of my all time favorite MCU movies. The scenes where Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel had memory flashes were a little confusing for the audience, but the rest of the movie makes up for it.To conclude, Captain Marvel is a great movie to watch before Avengers: Endgame. I loved the scenes between Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson). They portrayed these characters perfectly. Can't wait to see Captain Marvel in Avengers: Endgame, now that she is the most powerful Avenger.","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","hannahshimwell","11 March 2019","I don't understand all the hate for this film. It was better than other origin stories in the MCU, it tied up loose ends and gives the watcher shots they want to see, both story and character-wise. It was action packed and the story made sense and didn't stay too far from the comics. I was unsure about Larson's acting for the first half of the film, I had to warm to her, but after that it was a film that fits well into the MCU with the right levels of whit, comedy, action, and story.","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","illuminatilights01","16 June 2019","I wasn't familiar with Captain Marvel like I was with the more popular Avenger characters (had the comics as a kid, action figures, etc.) so I don't have the esoteric background to complain about what they didn't do right for the film.I also believe that a film should be viewed for what it is, the characters in it, not whatever issues you have with the actors/ actresses in real life.So starting off, I wasn't very much interested in Captain Marvel because I wasn't familiar with the story, same thing about Ant Man, same about Black Panther. Then all of complaining from males about Larson's comments and whatever reviews, biased or not that came from it pushed my expectations even further down whether or not they were written with vitriol for the actress.So I was a bit taken aback by the opening of it - you just straight into the S#*T, and without any background info, I was a bit like, ""what the hell is going on?"" but you find out what you need to know fairly quickly and Danver's isn't the most lovable character from jump street but she grows on you - much like a person with that personality type would probably do in real life.The story line unfolds differently from other Marvel movies and while there were some parts during it when I was questioning it, after finishing it, I can say that it was a refreshing way of story telling and directing that I really liked, especially from Marvel.They only thing I didn't like was not much explanation of what her power can actually do. She is blasting through reinforced cement and state of the art spaceships with ease but then when she shoots ""people"" it just knocks them around? C'mon stop nerfing, Disney!And it was great to get the Nick Fury backstory, especially his personality.","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","Drabble500","8 March 2019","This is a terrific multi-layered film that isn't without some problems. Knowing the MCU I was quite surprised by the turn of events.So Captain Marvel isn't Kree after all. Her super power source is therefore slightly confusing. We know that on the one hand it comes from the energy core that consumed her. On the other hand, what makes her different is that, er, she's human. That's an intriguing idea but slightly problematic.Brie did a great job. She's fairly restrained emotionally and the film does the opposite to the normal MCU format: with this one she starts with power and then we get flashbacks. She's also not your typical kickass female lead like for example Angelina Jolie or Daisy Ridley but that's probably really refreshing. I hope in real life she doesn't feel she has to emulate those types. Part of the appeal of this film is precisely the above point: you see her standing after she's fallen. She's a vulnerable girl who nevertheless picks herself up. Macho guys or T-fuelled posturisers who are used to Thor and Thanos aren't going to much warm to that kind of feminine hero but that's always been the thing about MCU: it breaks your conventional mould. Makes you rethink your meme.In some ways, my biggest problem, then, comes towards the end when we see this all-supreme Captain Marvel zooming into space (without even needing a helmet). It's a long way removed from the little girl lost theme. I'm not totally sure where MCU goes from that because the finale, where she meets the Avengers, is surely going to lead to Thanos getting his sorry butt kicked and, erm, that's it.Anyway, it's a great film. Some real laughs. Brie is great so are Lashana Lynch and Annette Bening. But the true stars of the film are probably Samuel L. Jackson and ... the cat. No, seriously.","10/10"

"Captain Marvel","stevendbeard","9 March 2019","I saw ""Captain Marvel"", starring Brie Larson-Kong:Skull Island, 21 Jump Street_2012; Samuel L. Jackson-Glass, Kong:Skull Island; Ben Mendelsohn-Robin Hood_2018, The Dark Knight Rises; Jude Law-Fantastic Beasts:The Crimes of Grindelwald, Spy and Annette Bening-Rules Don't Apply, Open Range.
This movie is based on the Marvel comic book character, not the original Captain Marvel that is now being published by DC comics-he goes by the name of Shazam ever since they lost the name rites to Marvel's character, but that's another story. Brie plays Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel. The movie is set in 1995 and you learn through flashbacks and memories her origin story. Samuel is Nick Fury and he-as well as another actor-is de_aged digitally so that he looks younger and he has both of his eyes. You do learn what happened that made him wear the eye patch-at least according to the MCU, aka Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's not the same as in the original comics. Story wise, there is a big galactic war going on between two alien races called the Kree and the Skrulls. Jude is the Kree soldier that trained Brie and Ben is the leader of the Skrulls, a shape_shifting race. Annette plays the Supreme Intelligence, an A.I. that gives the Kree their marching orders. Both races are competing to find a certain item of power and it just so happens to be hidden on Earth, so there is plenty of action to go around. I remember hearing some music by No Doubt and Nirvana among some others. The opening Marvel Studios logo-the one that usually shows lots of different Marvel characters-is a little different, focusing on only one person, and it is not Captain Marvel. Stan Lee has his usual brief cameo-filmed before he died in 2018-and I've heard he will have his last one in the Avengers End Game. There are two scenes as the end credits start; one is right after the credits start, and it includes several Avengers and it is connected to the Infinity War and the other one is at the very end and it is comical, involving a character named Goose.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci fi violence & action and some mild language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.
It was a little confusing at times, because of the flashbacks and memory scenes but it did make sense in the end.
Overall, I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","evgenycaruana","10 March 2019","Intro...So, Captain Marvel, the cosmic warrior hero that is the one to join the Avengers for Endgame, surprised me quite a bit.Getting into my review...The movie was good yes but it was flawed at certain parts such as the last part (spoiler) where Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers flies in space without her cool helmet... cringeworthy in my opinion, not a good way to end the movie.There were parts in the movie that were hilarious and I loved seeing Goose kicking ass with the tentacles shooting out! The cat was cute and adorable AF!Nick Fury was my favourite character in this movie, he didn't look as if CGI was being used on him, which is frikkin awesome, and his humor was on point. The buddy-cop comedy in my opinion worked in this movie. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson rocked on screen with their sassy humor and their chemistry just worked!Conclusion...On a final note, I was in tears when they showed a tribute for Stan Lee and when he appeared in the cameo on the train.Was the movie good or bad?Yes the movie was good and it is definitely worth the watch! I can't wait to see what they do with Captain Marvel in Endgame!","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","helvin3","10 March 2019","If this was just focusing solely on Carol (like with the first Iron Man) it wouldn't have worked - all the characters mixed in helped made this film great for me.

And his relationship with Goose: amazeballs hahahaha.","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","view_and_review","11 March 2019","Marvel is a victim of its own success. They've been so good for so long that perfection is expected with every release. Their brand name now rivals the likes of Apple, Nike, or Coke. Slapping ""Marvel"" on a movie means $100M or more.
That's not to say that they don't have to try, it's just to say that they don't have to try as hard. So, I don't say that they didn't try with Captain Marvel, I just don't think they gave their best effort.With 19 years of Marvel movies it's hard to bring along a superhero that's going to wow people. Of course there are the Marvel faithfuls that would be pleased with anything that has Marvel's name on it but for those others--what's left? After a Spider-Man, the X-Men, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Blade, Ant-Man, Black Panther, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and a host of supporting characters even a Captain Marvel seems tame. And let's be honest, how many of us saw this movie because it's attached to The Avengers: End Game?If I broke down my reasons for seeing Captain Marvel I'd say 50% because it's a Marvel movie, 40% because it's attached to The Avengers, and 10% because it's a superhero movie.At this point it's not simply about powers anymore. Sure, the superpowers are cool but they can only take a movie so far. The story needs to be good and the lead character needs to be even better. I found Brie Larson dull. Besides fitting the look needed she offered nothing. She failed to distinguish herself in a world of distinguished superheros.Marvel can easily absorb this loss and truthfully I'm probably in the minority by calling this a loss. IMO Captain Marvel didn't thrive on its own--much like Hulk didn't thrive on its own--not a problem, lets see how she does working with a team.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","TheJohnnyPHreak","9 March 2019","It's been almost three years since it was announced that Brie Larson was announced at Comic-Con to be playing the role of Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel. I had been waiting for the announcement for a while. I'm pretty close to being a die hard fanboy for Captain Marvel. When I became more of an adult and really got into comics, I don't know what it was but she appealed to me. Her character was the headstrong, powerful, smart military type that always kept things grounded emotionally. She is kind of like the equivalent of Superman for the Marvel Universe. But human and also even if she didn't have powers she would be a badass pilot. When the film and the date were released I was counting down the days. I couldn't wait to see this character I enjoyed so much on the page on the big screen.Here's the thing, I wasn't a fan of Brie Larson as a choice. I was hoping for Yvonne Strahovski (Chuck, 24) or Natalie Dormer (Game of Thrones). I was a bit confused with the choice of Brie Larson. Outside of the coming off her Academy Award win, I'm not sure what they thought. But that was just my opinion. Time went by and I don't know if I just forgot being upset about the casting or what, but when I saw those first leaked set photos I was very happy. Then I saw all the research and work she was putting into being Captain Marvel and it started putting me at ease. The first trailer was a bit hit or miss for me. With each trailer, my excitement for this film grew to a fever pitch. This film had become one of my most anticipated films of 2019 (top five at least). I am happy to report this is exactly the Captain Marvel film I wanted and have been waiting for.The quick rundown of the plot of the film is Vers (Larson) is a warrior with the Kree. The Kree who feature Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and Korath (Djimon Hounsou) have enemies with the Skrulls, shape-shifting alien species whose small faction in the film is lead by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn). When on an exaction mission Vers is caught by Skrulls and probed for information. This leads to memories that she can't put together. She escapes captivity and is hurled to Earth. Teaming up with a young Agent Nicolas J Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and young Agent Phil Coulson, Vers must figure out what all these memories mean and stop the on-coming Skrull/Kree war that is coming to earth.Brie Larson embodies Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. She's so cocky, funny, headstrong at times, but selfless and full of heart. I honestly couldn't have picked a better actress to play her. I don't know how Marvel does it but they really do get the best actors and actress to portray their characters. Samuel L. Jackson seems to be having the most fun playing Fury in any of the MCU films he's been in. This is young Fury, who isn't the hardcore spy with mountains of secrets and a grizzled closed-off demeanor. This happens to be his first encounter with alien beings and he plays with it so well. Also, who knew Fury was a cat person. (More on that amazing cat later) Jude Law is a good leader/foil for Danvers. He's pushing her to be the best she can be but in a poke/prod the bear way. He has things he's hiding from her and when he needs to ruthless he pulls it off very well.Ben Mendelsohn is probably the human that steals the most scenes. He knows he's in a superhero Marvel movie and proceeds to play the film just right. I'm very happy we get a multilayered villain that could be around for the future. Even the FX and makeup, he's excellent in his character. Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau might be the heart of the film. Her chemistry with Larson is so on point, one could think they've been friends for years off-screen. Rambeau keeps Danvers grounded. The love they have for each other is something that never goes away. She is family for Danvers and that pops off the screen. But the one scene stealer of them all is Goose the Cat. (Chewie in the comics, why they changed I'll never understand) Anytime Goose is on screen he commands attention. He has pretty decent chemistry with Fury and a few surprises to boot.Casting wise, the whole film is full of good performances. I was happy to see Annette Bening in the role(s) she was cast. They are important to the film and history of Captain Marvel. The film is so very sci-fi and I really enjoyed that. I know that Guardians Of The Galaxy is like a character-driven space opera but this film elements of Star Wars and Superman. It's very cool to see the MCU diving into their comic book roots and go all out sci-fi with their last few films. There's a lot of tech talk, aliens, superpowers and cool space travel. The action is good. The train fight/chase being the standout but I did enjoy the end space battle showing off how powerful Captain Marvel really is.Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck get the small character moments so perfect. Not that I have any issues with the action but I think with a second feature they will get their sea legs and give us something truly eye-popping on the scale that Captain Marvel deserves. That would be my only issues is that there is a really standout action set piece that screams ""wow did you see that?!"" Everything for me worked so well. And they connect this film to the bigger MCU picture like a piece in a big puzzle. There are more questions that are raised that aren't answered yet. Hopefully in a sequel and Avengers: Endgame we will get some of those answers.Captain Marvel was a total blast for me. The film does start off a bit slow but once Carol gets to Earth the film takes off in all the best ways. It's much like the opposite of the original Thor. Everything on Asgard was great but him on Earth was a bit underwhelming. All the performances were excellent and it seemed the entire cast was having so much fun playing their roles and being in this film. The story is basically Marvel's Superman story. I also see this as a film that demands multiple viewings. I can't wait to see the film again and see how Captain Marvel fits into Endgame and beyond. For the viewers that don't know there are two after credit scenes that people following this film series need to stay for.","8/10"
"Captain Marvel","ylopez-23794","10 March 2019","I saw this twice, once by myself yesterday to be exact 3-9-19 and Today 3-10-19 with a bunch of friends, they all loved it.
The movie is awesome I do believe Brie, plays really good her part of vers/Carol Danvers, the role seems to demand a great deal of physical action in which she demonstrated that she very fit and trained hard for her role.
I also love other actors such as Samuel L Jackson, he was the comedy relief portion at least with me he was a fresh of breath air. I also loved Clark Greg from ""The agents of the shield"" Coulson. One more let's not forget Annette Bening she was great I had never seen her in this type of role . Jude law is magnificent and impressive but I usually love him.
I highly recommend if you do like Marvel movies check this one out.","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","guyzradio","12 March 2019","I'm not going to say much -- see the movie and make up your own mind.
However:
The cat was terrific.Based on the delivery of lines, I full expected Ben Mendelsohn's character later in the movie was actually being voiced by Keith Richards.Pay close attention in the beginning. The opening sequences are not a disposable lead-in to the title, credits, etc. The plot is upon you from the start.Overall, quite entertaining.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","milyrake","9 March 2019","Please, please, please don't read these negative reviews and have doubts about seeing this film. Captain MarVel was great and is one of the top Marvel movies on my list. Waaaay better than Black Panther. There's great music, 80's and 90's throwbacks, comedy, action, twists and turns, a funny cat and the story comes full circle as you find out the full history of Captain Marvel. AND, she kicks serious @ss!People are so nitpicky, which is to say, finicky; overly critical; concerned with insignificant details. Just go see it for yourself and enjoy it for what it is. Another fun, Marvel, popcorn action flick.I'm giving it a 10 just to balance out the ridiculous 1 star ratings.","1/10"
"Captain Marvel","gazzalodi","9 March 2019","What's really good is that most of the spoilers that I saw on the internet before this was released were wrong about so much. A few good twists for the comic readers. The tribute to Stan Lee was very well done.I have read people bashing it as some kind of feminist indoctrination movie. It's not. It also gets bashed for being formulaic. It is. Marvel knows the formula that works for their origin stories and sticks with it here. I don't see that as a bad thing. I enjoy seeing the 'before they were awesome' stories.It's standard superhero fare. Better than most out there, but not top tier. It stands up well to Wonder Woman and Black Panther, better than the second and third Iron Mans, easily outclasses Age of Ultron, BvS and Justice League, not as good as Winter Soldier or Civil War in my opinion.Brie Larson is a very good actress but at times she seems to still be figuring out how the Marvel Cinematic Universe runs. Overall she's very good in the part. The 'empowering' scenes that seem to cause so much grief actually make sense in the context of her character. It's not a 'girls rule' thing, it's a kid who won't give up thing, kind of the same kid with a heart build up that Steve Rogers got. Her gender is not played up much at all, which is actually pretty neat. She's presented without trying to make excuses for her being a woman, much the same way guy superheros don't need to make an excuse for being a guy.Samuel L. Jackson does have a large role. I was expecting just a few shots of him here and there, but the movie also plays as a Nick Fury background-but-not-origin story. With a little Phil Coulson introduction to boot.Overall, worth the 20 bucks for me an my son to go watch, but not a repeat viewing in the theater film.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","kjnorman","10 March 2019","After some of the reviews here you would think that this movie is a turd. I was close to canceling my tickets and skipping it but my kids still wanted to go. Consequently I went in with low expectations. You know what, I was pleasantly surprised! I found it an enjoyable use of two hours and I was engaged the entire time.I'm not invested in Marvel comics but I have seen all the Marvel films. I watched it on how it stood up as a movie with no prior conceived notions as to what this character should be.I see many complaints about the film being boring. I'm not sure what movie those reviewers saw. I found how Brie Larsen played Vers to be appropriate for what we discover her Kree background to be; ""show no emotion"". After she lands on Earth we see her begin to discover who she really is and who is really the enemy. I found the twist to be a surprise (for me) and the way it was handled well done.Weaknesses? I can see the argument that Captain Marvel not having (an apparent) weakness to be something that may reduce the tension in the movie but our family never felt that. If you are someone that wants two hours of battle than perhaps you will be bored. But if you want more beyond a CGI-fest then I think there is a lot to be pleased about in this movie. Yes there are contrived conveniences but hey, it's a Marvel movie; they all have them. Is it logical? No. Is it fun, keeps you engaged for two hours? Yes. There have been other Marvel movies where I get bored with endless fights scenes (cough, cough Black Panther..) This one did not have that and for that I am thankful.","9/10"

She's easily right up there with Kristen Stewart and Hayden Christiansen for utterly lacking in any ability to emote.If this is the character they're going to base he MCU around going forward, good luck to them.","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","aleia-95244","9 March 2019","Loved the movie, and especially the fact that they made the Kree vs Skrull the opposite as it usually is in the comics.

The cat, as many people have pointed out, is the best, but for me also the music was very on point, especially that action scene with No Doubt's Just a Girl playing. Honestly, all those people reviewing without seeing it just because they can't stand a female lead movie being good should get at life, or at the very least watch the movie.","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","hdog-94019","9 March 2019","I am not one to usually write reviews, but I feel it is necessary with all the hate surrounding Captain Marvel.
It has been a while since I genuinely enjoyed a Marvel movie. The last one was Logan, which I think we can all agree that was one of the best things produced by Marvel thus far.
I honestly did not think Wonder Woman was amazing (maybe a 7?). However, I am all for female empowerment. Captain Marvel was exactly that: female empowerment, but in the best way possible. It didn't have a political agenda at all. It did not promote a feminist view. I was worried Larson's acting would have been lacklustre due to the previews, and some of the lines in the movie were pretty iffy. I was also worried that she would be a total Mary-Sue, but I was completely wrong. There was no lame romance (even though I am hoping that Carol will end up sapphic. She has to follow in Ms. Blanchett's footsteps, right?) to take away from the action: aka Hulk and Widow.
Unlike Infinity War, this movie did not try to pack too many things in at once. I thought it told a complete story, which is what I look for in movies. I don't like the set up for a sequel, even though Marvel clearly intends to add on to her character. Don't knock it until you watch it!","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","michaelcollins10-1","17 March 2019","You can't always take the kids to see a Hero movie these days, with all the extreme violence. This movie however, is definitely one the hole family can see together and make a full afternoon out with a meal and some fun. I would not include any kids under 10, unless you have seen it first and approve of your kids watching this one. I was happily surprised with this as it was not over the top and it was still very entertaining. Especially at the end of the movie when #@!$%& jumped in to #$)&^$#@ with $%#&^%, it was really a great twist. NO SPOILERS HERE :-) You are just going to have to go and see Captain Marvel your self.

"Captain Marvel","rdoubleoc","2 June 2019","Awesome soundtrack, and Brie Larson is a hottie.That being said, I really look forward to good new super hero origin stories, and was really looking forward to this one, but maybe that's why I thought it could be a little better. It's not a bad movie by any means, but just doesn't seem ""polished"" enough for a 150 million dollar budget (75mil, or even 100mil, I could easily understand). I know things are expensive, but for that money I expected something a little more exciting and thrilling. This movie has very good parts, but it just isn't like Final Destination or Jurassic Park movies (with similar budgets) where certain parts would literally make your heart pulse faster and make you think ""Oh, geez... Wow. That's nuts!"". Cloaked space lab was cool, but that's the only unique/special plot element besides the cat? We've made people look younger before, even though maybe not that accurately. Captain Marvel is a cool superhero, nonetheless, maybe even one of my favorites.Fight scene during ""I'm Just a Girl"" was pretty good.Good movie, but just isn't going to be one that I go and tell people about first thing tomorrow. Maybe I've been spoiled by Hollywood, but I just expected a little more for that kind of budget. Captain Marvel is one of my top favorite superheroes now, however.My top liked superheroes from Marvel:

"Captain Marvel","SallyWilliams","10 March 2019","Though it might not be the best solo MCU movie, it's definitely very entertaining. It's full of action, the story is interesting, the Kree/Scrull plot ties it to the galactic world of Guardians & Shield's last season.

"Captain Marvel","lukasvw-80-315156","9 March 2019","It feels like all reviews follow some sort of agenda. Either you worship a movie because it shows a strong female lead, or you hate it because of it.So, i will entirely focus on the movie, its place within the MCU and the quality of the story, acting, animations and so on.First of all: This movie isn't bad.
But it isn't great either.Neither was Thor the Dark World, but still nobody says Chris Hemsworth is a bad actor.This movie has his reasons to be there. And its not the worst and definitely not the best marvel movie. There seems not to be any feminist agenda within this movie - Captain Marvel is a woman - so its a bit more for the female audience than other MCU movies. But to call this movie some sort of feminazi worshipping you need to be a very insecure little boy.The acting isn't all bad. The jokes are sometimes good, sometimes very good, somtimes lame. There are some good CGI and some really bad (i'm not sure if its just looks bad, or if it looks as it should...)The story is fast and fills more like a filler episode before the big ""finale"" in Endgame. But thats ok. Those fillers are there for a reason. They provide some background information - and thats a good thing.So, if your reproductive organ is longer than your little finger and you are a fan of the MCU, you will enjoy this movie - but probably never watch it twice.","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","kerlen_andrea","8 March 2019","I really enjoyed watching this movie and I've seen quite a lot of superhero action movies over the past ten years and more.
Right at the beginning, there is a nice hommage to Stan Lee and there is also a cameo later.
The protagonist is a strong and sympathetic character and she is played really well by Brie Larson. Like most other superheroes her main choice of problem solving is by violent means but in between her actions also hints at the powerful message to never give up and stand up again (and again) no matter what odds are against you.
She is accompanied by some other strong characters too, i.e. she gets joined by Nick Fury. The setting is in 1995, so here we see a younger Nick Fury and also Agent Coulson, both already working for S.H.I.E.L.D yet in different positions than later. We also get a soundtrack full of hits of the Nineties, like Nirvana, Garbage, TLC and others. The original soundtrack was not overwhelming yet okay. If you see the movie, wait until the end to see two short extra scenes, one of them hinting at ""Marvel's The Avengers: Endgame""I won't tell anything about the plot in order to avoid spoilers. The weaknesses I see in the movie are these two:
1. One might argue that Captain Marvel is so powerful that she seems a bit like a Mary Sue. However she has at least one flaw, because she often looses her temper quite quickly and has problem controlling her powers and her impulses, at least at the beginning. Maybe another or a different character flaw would have been a good idea yet I don't how the character is presented in the comics. Maybe she is just meant to be so powerful and with little flaws - and I can completely live with that.
2. Due to a lot of flashbacks the structure of a story seems a bit like a puzzle. The story keeps going back and forth in time which makes it a bit difficult to watch at some points especially because you keep wondering what is going on - like the protagonist does as well. However, finally everything falls into place when the plot twist is revealed and the action is heading to the showdown.","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","thesar-2","10 March 2019","God, I love Brie Larson. Loved her in Scott Pilgrim and absolutely agreed with her Oscar for Room. So what the bleep happened here?It is hard to think back to the many, MANY superheroes of the past couple of decades to find a superhero SO plain, SO boring, SO shallow, SO lifeless and without a bit of soul or personality as Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. I had to check to see if George Lucas directed this, because I definitely saw the female Anakin Skywalker here.She was so bad, or her character, at least, she took me completely out of the movie. I never once rooted for her, couldn't care less about her plight and frankly was just waiting for her to end up right where I knew she would thanks to the third Avengers movie. And that's sad, because the movie isn't necessarily a bad one...it's just the title character had none of that Marvel as suggested.Erasing the bore, I loved how the movie was shot. Set in the mid-90s, it, of course, had a kick-ass 90s soundtrack (all of my favorites!!) and the familiar technology and stores from back then. But, bypassing that, the movie FELT like it was shot, edited, paced and scripted like it was from the 1990s. I totally felt transported back to my favorite decade and I praise this movie for that.In a rather quick and easy to follow setup, we learn our title character wants to join an elite group of alien warriors hell-bent on stopping shapeshifters from destroying their protected worlds. Naturally, the one focused on in the movie is Earth and there, our ""hero"" has to track the shapeshifters with no other than Nick ""call him"" Fury.Sadly, the movie is predictable from minute one and this is not just because it ties into many other MCU films. Normally, that would bother me, but again, the filmmaking all felt really 90s to me, so I'm pretty familiar with the old formulas.Only a select handful of jokes landed, mostly from Sam Jackson and the special effects were good, not great. Too many of the older actors looked fake as younger versions of themselves. Despite that, it was so nice seeing Annette Bening again. It's been far too long.I didn't hate the movie, but will only give it a VERY mild recommendation. If Captain Marvel/Brie Larson wasn't so incredibly and painfully dull, we would've had a MUCH BETTER Marvel outing. It even ended somewhat solidly for her, but not enough to make up for the previous 2-hours of sleepwalking she did.***Final thoughts: Admirable on the opening Marvel Logo and the 1st post-credit scene: totally worth it, especially since it's only 1-2 minutes into the 20-minute end credits. You can absolutely skip the last post-credit scene and just Google it when you get home.","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","silverlve","9 March 2019","Went in super excited and came out even hungrier for the final chapter of this story. Carol Danvers story is really well put together and how she is shown growing into her powers and her abilities is good. The battle with the Skrulls and Kree throws some interesting jabs at you and how it all comes together is cool. My only grievance is how that big battle scene is a bit dark per the environment it was in but I would have enjoyed it a bit lighter to see more of the scenes.","10/10"
"Captain Marvel","gregthmann","8 March 2019","I read a few reviews prior to my midnight screening of the premier for this and was in the mindset of ""oh no, this is gonna be crap"" but after actually watching, I really enjoyed it.
Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson and the rest of the cast are superb in my eyes. A great deal of humour chucked in also and the action is spot on. No idea where the hate for Brie comes from but from a neutral, I thought her performance was spot on. Very very good CGI (as we have come to expect) and it sets it all up nicely for what is to come in April.
Two end credit scenes, so stay in your seats, as they are worth it (no spoiler) and please ignore the rather bizzarre 1/10 ratings. Not even sure if they watched it. See for yourself and you will not be disappointed.","10/10"

"Captain Marvel","TheHonestCritic","10 March 2019","I just saw the movie: ""Captain Marvel"" (2019), written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. Starring Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and more! All I can say is; this movie took me by surprise. I went in ready to hate this movie and be bored with it, but I thought it was great! Ignore the haters and feminist comments you hear all over the internet, all of that is totally unnecessary. Just because the lead superhero in a movie is a woman does not mean the film can't be good. Any way, back to the review. This movie was a joy from beginning to end! The story may have been just another superhero origin story, but it was told in a fresh and unique way. Although, the first ten minutes kind of dragged, the rest of the story was excellent. The acting was also great. However, the one actor I was skeptical about was Brie Larson. I was worried that she might be too dull and wooden. But, she put on a great performance, as did the rest of the cast! She is perfect for the Captain Marvel character. The sets/locations were good, atmosphere in a film is one of the biggest factors. Do I even need to praise the special effects? Most special effects in modern movies and TV shows are usually a given. All of the special effects in this film were great, especially the de-aging effect for actors Samuel L. Jackson, and Clark Gregg. They really did look 20 years younger! That was really well done, and I was really impressed with the result. Props to the editing team! Probably the only flaw in this film is the soundtrack, it is good for the most part. However, it bounces all over the place, for example: it doesn't stick to any particular tone during the movie. Granted, I do love 1990's music, but the layout of the film score just seemed a little jumbled. Now a soundtrack like that can work when in the proper movie, but it doesn't work here. This was a very fun and exciting film, and I can't wait to see it again! It may not be as excellent as some of the other Marvel movies, and it's definitely not nearly as mind-blowing as ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", or ""Avengers: Infinity War"". But still, it's certainly worth watching in theaters, and buying on DVD. I give this film a 4 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Captain Marvel"" yet, you should go check it out. I hope you enjoyed my review for this movie!","8/10"

"Captain Marvel","LBarlane24","19 February 2020","As you may know, I've covered CM before. And having done so, I actually found myself to enjoy, unlike most of the mass majority. That being said, I'm sorry to say that I still had a lot of fun watching it upon second viewing. And the reason I'm covering it again is because of the endless comparison between it and another superhero movie that came out two years earlier, but I'll get to that in a little bit.Now before I begin, it is necessary for me to address the elephant in the room. The main star (that of course being Brie Larson) has received endless backlash for some ... comments that she made a while back. Since then, the actress's reputation has been in boiling hot water, with people across the internet (cough right-wing cough) chastising her; some have even gone out of their way to mocking her.I, as a conservative white male, really couldn't care less about the mediocre impressions Larson has made in recent years. Sure, technically she verbally attacked a massive group of people. But must I remind everyone that it was only that one time? I assure you all that Brie Larson does not Hate ""white men"" and everyone (left and right) should know this.Now with all of that being said, let me flat-out say that Brie Larson KILLED IT as the titular character. She was assertive, a wise-cracker, and took no nonsense from anyone. Many of said that Larson lacked emotion which is flat-out BS if you ask me. 1. Perhaps everyone focused to much on her facial expressions and not enough on the expressions from her EYES. 2. The character was told on multiple occasions by Jude Law's character, Yon-Rogg, that it was necessary to shelf all forms of emotion, as I recall it being a code of theirs.Samuel L. Jackson was fine as Nick Fury, but he was not as great as he was in all the previous films. The gripe that I had was that he seemed to be played mostly for comic-relief. Many have also taken issue on the fashion in which he loses his eye. I (no pun intended), on the other hand, didn't mind it all that much. The thing is though, Fury said in CA: Winter Soldier, and I quote ""Last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye."" I guess some (if not most, including me) assumed that it'd be in a more SERIOUS fashion. But surprisingly enough, that wasn't exactly the case; spoiler, Fury gets clawed by Goose.I've seen a lot of reviews saying that the movie was boring. Yeah, next you'll be telling me that Ad Astra was ENTERTAINING. There are also reviews saying that there was little to no character development. Um ... did you people even WATCH the damn film!? There have even appeared to be reviews saying that Carol Danvers is a Mary Sue ... Yeah, allow me to go over this, and I quate, ""Mary Sue is a term used to describe a fictional character, usually female, who is seen as too perfect and almost boring for lack of flaws."" Now what flaws does Carol Danvers have exactly? Well at the start of the film, she is basically the odd one out, being held back and ridiculed constantly by her ""mentor"" Yong-Rogg. Even after arriving on Earth, she is gawked at by numerous bystanders. She is powerful alright. But for the majority of the film, she has slight trouble controlling said power.The point is that Captain Marvel has been condemned moviegoers for all the wrong reason, while Wonder Woman was flat-out PRAISED for all the wrong reasons. There have also been people comparing Brie Larson to Gal Gadot; specifically, the majority of them pretty much favor Gadot over Larson. Let me just say what the difference is between the two is that Brie Larson is an actress while Gal Gadot is a model. Larson might not be as attractive as Gadot, but she has been acting since she was at least 7-years old. Gadot, despite having served in the military, has been ""acting"" for only about 15 years, and her assets are nothing more than physical.Overall, Captain Marvel is an underrated gem, and the fact that people all over the internet call it inferior to Wonder Woman drives me nuts. It may not be great, but it is nowhere near to being a bad film, and hopefully it'll gain more respect in the future.","8/10"

It has a good plot, good action sequences, and a few nice Easter eggs. It was never going to compete with Avengers: Infinity War, but if it's an excellent opener for Endgame, a nice introduction to a new big character and definitely worth a watch. Some of the reviews on here are far too harsh and quit frankly unjustified. Go to cinema, grab some popcorn and enjoy it!","9/10"
"Captain Marvel","nate-car","14 March 2019","The 21st in an ongoing storyline, of a 20 run movie streak, & a month before the most anticipated movie of all time (Avengers 4), this movie was ALWAYS GOING TO MAKE MONEY...But could the film makers deliver a quality movie when they are so caught up in gender, identity & social justice politics?
Sadly... no.I loved Jude Law & his Kree team in this movie. Gemma Chan was melt in your mouth & STILL break a tooth cool! I could easily have watched a good movie about these guys, (called Kree/Skrull War?)... not what we got though.Brie Larson as Captain Marvel looked sad, uncomfortable, awkward & angry the entire movie. Her appearance did not look heroic, any Captain Marvel cosplay I have seen looked better than her, & it never looked like she enjoyed the role or costume.Nick Fury the character, in almost half the MCU movies is ruined in this movie, & his origin & that of his infamous missing eye is thrown out for cheap laughs, that fell completely flat. For him to get his eye scratched out by a ridiculous MCGUFFIN is film heresy, & the writers should never work in film again.The Skrulls first outing & origin is also ruined in this film. For 57 years in comics & cartoons, they have been the coolest & bad-ass enemies of the Fantastic Four, X-Men & Avengers. But in this movie for a social commentary they are made into sympathetic refugees (2/3s into the movie?) & ruin any chance of telling some of the greatest stories in the MCU.Captain Marvels powers were completely inconsistent the entire movie also, sometimes she could be beaten by Jude Law, or normal humans, or an average Skrull, & her photon blasts were just that, a lame light show that mostly did nothing? Also, CM received her powers from the cosmic cube being shot at, but Jude Law was ALSO caught in the blast & received a concussion instead? Bad writing...Over all, I gave this movie a 3 or 4 out of 10 for 2/3 of the movie & watched it reluctantly entertained... until the final 1/3 when it completely $hit the bed. The ending was so poorly written & executed it went down to a 2/10 with absolutely NO chance of redemption.
A real blown opportunity & the first FAIL in the MCU...","9/10"

"Captain Marvel","saptesh786","5 June 2020","Good movie from Marvel Studio. Understandable story not so confused or not too many characters like Avengers. Brie Larson is perfect in her role and she justified the role. They said this movie is made for Captain Marvel's entry in Avengers End Game, but in End Game she has very little role and not effective as it should be. Such powerful character must have bigger role in End Game. As me captain Marvel is better that Black Widow. We also got the reason here of why Fury's one eye covered in Avengers' series. Must watchable for Marvel lovers. I do not understand why so negative reviews here for such good movie and I strongly oppose to them who hated it. If you have not seen this yet then watch first and do not go with ratings or review.","10/10"

"Iron Man 2","dbborroughs","5 June 2010","Disappointing and uneven follow up to the powerhouse of a few years ago.Jon Favreau proves that his ability to direct a solid movie isn't there. forgive me the only film of his that I think worked start to finish was the first film.The pacing is all off with whole sequences going on too long or not long enough. Honestly most of the first half is numbing with the result that I wanted to curl up and go to sleep.Realism is out the window with several sequences looking more like the sort of things we'd make fun of from 1970's movies (The race sequence prior to Iron man is just silly- though once Iron Man shows up it's note perfect. And bits of the final fight sequence screamed Conquest of the Planet of the Apes) This is a movie of pieces. the script is good, but badly directed. There a moments that are on target with the end of the race sequence excellent, The creation of Bullwhip into a real villain, Black Widow kicking ass, and other small moments that show what the film should have been. Unfortunately Favreau in putting the film together ruined it (Or was it th editor?) The performances are excellent for the most part with the exception of Paltrow who has become shrill and Sam Rockwell who has been given nothing to do so he does shtick.This will play better on DVD where you can zip past the dead spots.","3/10"
"Iron Man 2","ma-cortes","27 June 2011","A well-intentioned and interesting plot based on the characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby , following the events developed in ¨Iron Man I ¨ and repeating the main actors . Because of his superhero alter ego, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must contend with deadly issues involving the government, his own friends and new enemies . With the world now learns of his dual life as Stark is submitted to the armored pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military , being only helped by SHIELD agency formed by colonel Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) . Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) at his side , must forge new alliances and battle evil enemies as Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and Justin Hammer ( Sam Rockwell). Heroes aren't born !. They're built !. Get ready for a different breed of heavy metal hero !. Prepare for heavy metal! Even heroes fall !. Unleash the power behind the armor !. It's not the armor that makes the hero, but the man inside !Nice performance by Rober Downey Jr as superhero Iron Man, the billionaire inventor named Tony Stark who faces powerful enemies . This spectacular comic-book movie contains fantasy , noisy action, humor , romance , thrills and is pretty entertaining. This is a dynamic, fast- paced and fun movie . Full of action , it's complemented by exciting images, thrills and breathtaking scenes , including groundbreaking computer generator special effects . The picture relies on terrific flying sequences , rousing fighting , and relentless pursuits . The attractive story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Iron Man I¨ also directed by Jon Favreau ; both movies result to be an intense variation on Stan Lee's comic book creation . Our superhero, well incarnated by Downey Jr dons splendidly the metallic armor , the reason for he can be identified the rest of his life as Iron Man and he deserves credit for remaining true to character . Breathtaking array of technical effects with impressive set pieces illuminate the Iron Man's full-blown adventures . The amazing plot is pure entertainment and with screenplay by actor/writer Justin Theroux , based on characters created by Stan Lee , as usual appears in a brief cameo . Overwhelming production design , though full of digital effects with impressive scenes and portentous fights . Rousing musical score fitting to action by composer John Debney and colorful cinematography by cameraman Matthew Libatique .The motion picture was professionally directed by Jon Favreau , an ordinary secondary actor who triumphs as fimmaker with ¨Zathura¨, ¨Elf¨ , ¨Iron Man I¨and of course in this ¨Iron Man 2¨ .This big budgeted movie was compellingly made by John Favreau , directing brilliantly this superhero story . Subsequently , Favreau shot other spectacular and family movies with similar technician and artistic style : ¨Jungle Book¨ (2016) and ¨The Lion King¨ (2019) . Rating : Interesting and passable sequel .","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","xamtaro","4 May 2010","The sequel to Marvel studio's surprise hit of 2008 is here, bigger than ever. But is it better? After the surprise success of Iron Man, expectations for the sequel, from both movie viewers and long time comic books fans, were no doubt high.Picking off where the first film ended, billionaire genius Tony Stark has just revealed to the world his identity as the armor clad superhero, Iron Man. Now he reaps the whirlwind consequences of his actions as both the military and unscrupulous competitor Justin Hammer vie to obtain the secrets of Stark's Iron Man technology for their own gain. Too add to the flames, Stark soon discovers that the very technology that is keeping his heart alive is also poisoning him. As he tries to salvage a life that is slowly falling to pieces and his growing feelings for his long time assistant Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow), Starks has to contend to with a foreign weapons genius named Ivan Vanko who seems to bear a deep seated grudge against the ailing billionaire; a grudge that stemmed from the legacy of Tony's father, Howard Stark.Whatever was good in the first movie is carried on in true sequel fashion. The acting and chemistry among the cast is definitely the highlight of the whole film. Robert Downey Jr IS Tony Stark, though less of a playboy following his ""change of heart""(figuratively and literally) in the first movie, but still the same wisecracking, smirky eccentric. Everyone is just so natural in their roles including the villains, especially The character of Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell. Hammer had all the makings of a silly one dimensional villainous caricature, but manages to be a well rounded scumbag of a corporate competitor, providing some excellent comic relief while still presenting a credible threat to the hero.That being said, the script is just littered with witty banter, intelligent jokes and a good number of ""Easter eggs"" for the long time comic book fans. Writer Justin Theroux had a good number of interesting themes going for this movie, most notable of which is the theme of ""legacy"", of what people leave behind when they are gone; their impressions on their successors and how the effects of their past actions would echo down the years long after one has passed. Stark himself, faced with his inevitable demise, does not want to leave a legacy of death as a weapons designer. Aside from that, we see how the legacies of both Stark's and Ivan Vanko's fathers have affected their present lives.Now, Vanko's (played by Sin City's Mickey Rourke) is a truly tragic tale. It is easy to pass him off as a ""darth maul"" type character with no other purpose than to provide the hero with a powerful opponent for the mandatory climax. But to the more attentive viewers, one can see how Vanko is basically the dark opposite reflection of Tony Stark. Both are geniuses, both are where they are because of their respective fathers yet different circumstances in life brought them down entirely different paths. The parallels between his origin story of creating the ""whiplash"" powered armor from scrap, getting captured(in a similarly explosive manner) in order to develop weapons for one man to bring down his competitor all the way to his cunning escape plan and his mistaken impression about his dearly departed father are all uncannily similar to Tony Stark's experiences in the first movie that led up to his debut as the hero Iron Man and his mistaken impression about his own father.The one thing viewers might not appreciate is that this sequel seems to lack that sense of ""fun"" that the first film had, taking on a more serious tone at times to dish out the more complex themes and even a romantic sub-plot. It really is too bad that the more complex themes are there but not really expanded upon. This leaves a lot of ""could have been more"" moments hanging by the time the show ends. At least the action is satisfying high octane eye candy as Jon Favreau's steady directing hand brings out the intensity of every battle scene. Special effects are top notch as usual except for a couple of cartoony looking moments that do require some suspension of disbelief, for example the briefcase that transforms into an iron man armor with armor parts seemingly appearing from out of nowhere.By the time the all too familiar final battle is over and the credits start rolling, one gets the impression that Iron Man 2 could have been a lot more than the sum of its parts. A little longer running time would have fixed most of the story kinks but perhaps Marvel is merely using this movie as a money generator and spring board to something greater.(Blatant teasers are thrown into the narrative itself almost like a running catalog of future Marvel film projects).Topping the first film is no easy feat and of course Iron Man 2 would disappoint a few here and there. But it is nonetheless one of the most entertaining comic book movies that mixes action, wit, drama and cast chemistry so well. If widespread appeal is its purpose, then Iron Man 2 has fulfilled that function magnificently in that even a newcomer to the franchise can kick back and enjoy the show. Marvel studios has started a new legacy beyond great comics. Here is a legacy of comic book movies, true to the spirit of its source material yet tailored nicely to the tastes of the modern movie audience.","8/10"

Then of course there's the romantic angle with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts who gets expanded screen time here, to whom he hands over Stark Industries to by appointing her CEO. I had enjoyed all the scenes between Paltrow and Downey Jr as they shared great chemistry, and didn't mind that the film took the pause from the action to throw the spotlight on this. In fact, Stark is pretty much the Santa Claus in giving away things, having to face his mortality and to put some business continuity plans into motion. A little too bad that the scene in the teaser trailer highlighting the banter in the plane didn't make it to the final cut.But all work and no play makes him a grumpy soul, so enter Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman, his new sexy private secretary from the legal department who is more than meets the eye. Johansson has now proved that she's got it in her to be in an action film, and her limited action scenes here will surprise and leave you breathless. Mickey Rourke seem to have picked off from his Wrestler role in playing the Russian villain Ivan Vanko, riding on the parallel and theme of Fathers and Sons, whose father was seemingly played out by Howard Stark, and is finding it apt to finally take it out on Stark Industries using similar technology the earlier generation developed, and now backed by sugar daddy industrialist Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell. Rockwell plays the classic business rival bitterly humiliated by Tony, and from observing Ivan's potential, decided to bankroll the Russian's capability for the US military. Hating a man in common make for strange bedfellows indeed.Cameo wise, there's Stan Lee if you can spot him in a brief moment, probably his easiest and non event-filled one to date given he's just standing around, Samuel L. Jackson continuing his role as Nick Fury of SHIELD, now assessing Tony Stark to determine if he's indeed the man they need for his top secret boy band, Gary Shandling as the senator pursuing the weaponization of the Iron Man suit for the military, and of course, director Jon Favreau himself who continues his role as Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan, and you can tell his acting itch from his expanded role in getting in on the fun rather than just solely standing behind the camera.But of course the tongues will wag whether Don Cheadle can pick up from where Terrence Howard left off. Whatever the reason may be for the latter's departure, he will likely be kicking his behind now for leaving the project. That anticipatory look Rhodes had in the first film at the metal suit worn would bring a smile to any fanboy in the know of what would be the next logical step, and frankly speaking I would have enjoyed some continuity here. But having a different actor in a role done by someone else in a preceding film isn't something new, and Cheadle stepped in confidently from the start, helped by the script which puts it in point blank terms that he's there now, and they should move on. Well said, and great job on being War Machine, in a best-friends-temporal fallout subplot which accounted for the action at the midway mark.Justin Theroux, who wrote the screenplay for Tropic Thunder, took over the scriptwriting for this film, doing the narrative justice with plenty of fan-moments, and oh-not-so subtle merchandising opportunities that Tony Stark would be proud of. The excellent casting has the brilliance of Theroux's story to thank for in keeping the many subplots in check, making Marvel fans happy through the plenty of easter eggs peppered around, coming up with an intoxication of a different sort for Tony Stark to deal with and a chance for him to go back to the drawing board, getting his hands dirty with the building of something. Action-wise, yes there is only a handful of them, but each of them brought something to the table in terms of excitement, thrills and spills. The special effects and graphics here were one up against the previous film, and it was a definite visual feast especially when suits got up against suits, warranting a second look at the film just to catch everything that's happening at the same time. The finale was a full 30 minutes worth of action end to end and features the Iron Man-War Machine tag team up, which served up a lot more than what we've all glimpsed from clips here and there. Singapore, this is yet another opportunity to be proud of with our compatriots also involved in the visual effects department, ala Kick-Ass.Iron Man 2 is set to convert the non-fan, and is crafted so that newcomers to the hero could jump right into the fun without needing to watch the first one (why haven't you!). For Marvel fans though, you have Jon Favreau to thank for whetting all our appetites in making this film the teaser to the other upcoming Marvel films such as Captain America, Thor, and I will be right there to holler Avengers Assemble! when the time comes. Stay until the end of the credits for a scene which will make you salivate. A-One!","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Seth_Rogue_One","20 November 2016","Yet another ridiculously high rated Marvel movie, we get it Marvel fanboys you just love it when a new Marvel movie comes out, so much that you forget any flaws in it and give it a 10 or a 9 anyways.But come on seriously? Wouldn't you rather they spent a little time at actually writing a somewhat decent script and making it a bit more entertaining than to praise EVERYTHING they do to the skies just because you want a new chapter in the Marvel universe?Cause this is NOT a good movie, 35 minutes of decent at best action and 85 minutes of nonsensical blabber.Mickey Rourke was the only highlight in this movie, the scene at the racetrack with him was really cool but then he just became a wasted opportunity just like the rest of the movie.A really boring turd of a film.","3/10"
"Iron Man 2","khanbaliq2","11 June 2010","Iron Man 2 is a fine sequel. Almost the whole cast returns intact, and director Jon Favreau has more screen time in his role as Happy Hogan. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is riding high after the events of Iron Man (2008). He has become famous worldwide, and he re-institutes the Stark Expo. But problems begin to pile up. Another wealthy industrialist wants his Iron Man technology. Then a new villain appears. Stark's relationship with his assistant Virginia Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also expanded upon. There's a lot going on in the film, but its rather weak script hurts it for sure. Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan Vanko stands out. He's more menacing than Obadiah Stane was in the first film. Vanko's first encounter with Stark leads to a thrilling fight scene. Unfortunately Rourke's character isn't fully developed. This is a problem with other characters in the film as well. Vanko is a memorable villain but if Rourke was given more screen time and his character had more of a backstory I'm sure he could have been even more memorable. Still, Rourke tried to make his character as complex as he could.The film's special effects are excellent. Some of the time, however, they're used on shootouts and explosions that don't produce much excitement. There's a lot more humour this time around. I was smiling or laughing during most of the film. Scarlett Johansson as the beautiful Natasha Romanoff gets to show off some impressive martial arts moves. It's rather funny afterwards because no one else can fight like her. Overall, the film is not as good as Iron Man. Still, it's an entertaining summer blockbuster and the performances are solid. I wasn't expecting much from the film but was pleasantly surprised. I recommend Iron Man 2.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","blanbrn","9 May 2010","""Iron Man"" is not my favorite superhero(that place goes to Batman)nor does he rank ahead of Wonder Women still Tony Stark is an interesting cocky sucker of enough character to watch. As ""Iron Man 2"" for a sequel really delivered. As director Jon Favreau once again kept the action rolling with special effects and kick ass action sequences. Once again Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark former weapons mogul turned special agent Iron Man. This time his challenge is a Russian villain named Ivan(Mickey Rourke fresh off his classic performance in ""The Wrestler"") who wants to destroy the world with his new chemical and high tech weapons. And Sam Rockwell struts as a money hungry arms dealer.Returning is Gwyneth Paltrow as Tony's girlfriend now company CEO. And to spice up the picture a real treat of eye candy is Scarlett Johansson as Natasha who's sexy as hell! She becomes a new superhero! Really this film is a showcase for cutting edge technology that shows human inventions. And it was nice to see a cameo by Bill O' Reilly too. Overall this picture is a good treat of action and explosive technology. Probably a watch for any comic book fan.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","masonsaul","21 November 2019","It isn't as good as the original but Iron Man 2 is still a really good sequel. Robert Downey Jr. once again gives an incredible performance and is extremely charismatic. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Sam Rockwell all give great performances. Jon Favreau's direction is really good and it's consistently funny. The CG is impressive and the music by John Denney is good. However, Mickey Rourke is wasted as a forgettable villain and the final battle is a little short.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","ccthemovieman-1","9 October 2010","I was pleasantly surprised with this, thinking that it's probably another sequel that doesn't match up to the original. I was wrong; I thought this was better, a more likable and entertaining film than the first! Of course, it helps to know in advance that the ""hero"" (""Ton Stark,"" played by Robert Downey) is even more obnoxious in this film. Knowing that, I didn't let that bother me and just enjoyed the good acting in here and the excellent special-effects. Mickey Rourke (""Ivan Vanko"") is almost always interesting to watch so I enjoyed his role, too, even if I had a hard time understanding his Russian accent.The story is, yes, sophomoric but most action films today are. Just enjoy the funny lines, CGI, the pretty women (Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johannson) and wild heroes and villains and you should get your money's worth out of the viewing. See it on Blu-Ray and you'll enjoy it that much more.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","BwSwim","10 May 2010","For some reason this movie had not been getting the greatest critic reviews. I do not understand that at all. I thought the movie was very enjoyable and a successful sequel in the series.For anyone who has seen the first Iron Man you can expect much of the same in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark like he is meant for the part. He has the same sarcastic wit and self-confidence that is evident in his other movie roles. Gwyeneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts, has a comes more to the forefront in the sequel. I also personally love that Jon Favreau is the driver for Stark/Potts, and that he gets into the action a little bit. You have to respect the director for that, even though Jon has done plenty of acting himself.Normally in when they replace someone in a sequel with a different actor/actress I am very upset. However, Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2 as War Machine/Lt. Rhodes made me happy. This is similar to what happened with Maggie Gylenhal in the Dark Night.Samuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury has a bigger role, and it leads all the viewers into wanting The Avengers movie to come out immediately. Scarlett Johansson also showed up with some impressive stunt work, along with her always gorgeous looks.All in all it was a well done sequel. The plot is not too convoluted to follow. The new villain, played by Mickey Rourke, is very impressive and fun to watch. The action scenes are all entertaining but they do not completely drive the movie. The only thing that I wished for leaving the theater was a longer final fight scene.Also, make sure to watch after the credits!! It is short, but worth it.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","Dash1969","28 April 2010","Iron Man 2 sure delivers the fun but it's such intelligent fun. Honestly, its Stan Lee meets Shakespeare. The Hammer/Stark rivalry is more like Hamlet and Claudius then Superman to Lex Luthor. Iron Man is simply more complex as a character then anything else you'll see in a summer film but it loses none of the spark or none of the pure popcorn fun. How many other films can you say that about? Stark's vulnerability is very much on display here as his personal life crumbles through various unique conflicts. He has to struggle with the government for control of his armor and deal with his growing celebrity. At the same time his personal life takes a turn as a love triangle emerges. He (like soon all of America) becomes attracted to his new aide (the lovely Scarlett Johansson), causing tension with his former assistant but now new Stark Industries CEO Pepper Potts (the also lovely Gwyneth Paltrow). They manage to pull all this off remarkably well and still leave character time for Rhodey and the villains. It's a believable sci-fi story featuring an intellect story that's wild but has the right amount of humor, angst and drama. Like I remember about Iron Man 1, I can't think of a weak moment in the film. The visual effects are incredible. They did the memory of their boss, the great Stan Winston, proud. They set the bar high again. Now the only question is whether they have anything left in the tank for Iron Man 3? I'm betting that they do.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","EddyOne","28 April 2010","Saw the movie in a press screening here are my humble thoughts:Before I start with my short review of Iron Man 2, I have to say two words about Iron Man 1. I really dug the first one despite of being a little disappointed by the grand finale. Robert Downey Jr. kills it, action, humor, pacing... loved it. I'm not a big comic geek, and not that familiar with the original Iron Man comics, so please excuse if some of the stuff I thought was weird, was actually accurate adapted.So while the opening credits where rolling and I saw all the big names of actors that I happen to love, I really thought that it might be hard to give all of them a fair amount of stuff to do in the movie. And as it happened to turn out, I was right. I was especially disappointed by Mickey Rourke's part as Whiplash. Don't get me wrong, Rourke was great. He looks mean as usual and I loved every scene he's in. Unfortunately Favreau really pulled a Darth Maul on him. After the last fight I honestly sat in my chair and was like ""that's it? you can't be serious?!"". Rourke's Character had almost the same potential (at least from his talent as an actor and his looks in the movie) as Heath Ledger's Joker in Dark Knight. But he never lived up to that expectation due to the lack of screen time and, well... a purpose.But the main problem I had with Iron Man 2 was the lack of a meaningful story and motivation for almost all of the characters. We are introduced to Scarlett Johansson's ""Black Widow"", and blame it on my lack of knowledge of the graphic novels, but I had no Idea what her purpose in the movie was. The first part of the movie she's just the hot secretary with almost no lines. Eventually she puts on a tight super hero costume and tries to find Whiplash. There is a brief action-sequence, where she kicks some ass, but truth be told, Hit-Girl would wipe the floor with Black Widow. What I really liked though, was Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. He totally killed it and you can tell he enjoyed his part as the sleazy scumbag pulling the strings in the background.I also liked Don Cheadle as James Rhodes (he was on par with Terrence Howard on this one), but I felt his character suffered from the lack of time for character development. There is this scene, where Tony Stark is seriously messed up, partying at his home in his Iron Man suit and randomly shooting stuff. Rhodes is tired of the situation and grabs himself another one of the Iron Man suits, battles Stark and than leaves. With the suit. I don't know if that's the way it was done in the comics, but I didn't like it at all. In the first movie we witness how Stark becomes Iron Man, how he needs to learn to use the suit and become one with it, how he builds it and we can understand, that he is the only one, who could use it that way. Apparently we're wrong, because all you need, is the suit. It's like anyone could be Batman, if he just could get a hold of his cape. There is no explanation as to why Rhodes can fly this suit like he owns it, there isn't anything told about the relationship between Stark and Rhodes. I just felt this part was incredible weak.The whole movie felt like a setup for another movie. Characters are introduced, stuff happens, but nothing really matters, at best it hints, that there COULD be happening something in the future.Another big problem I had though, was the lack of 'magic moments' and thrilling action, like in the first flick (I still get goosebumps, thinking about how Tony Stark flew in his suit for the first time). Everything just runs too smooth, there is almost no tension, you never think anything could harm Tony Stark, you never feel something bad is about to happen. If I compare this with the incredible Dark Knight, it feels like a kids movie, something like the ranks of Sky High. Plus, there was just to little Iron Man in Iron Man, to little I care about. Iron Man 2 was made to prepare us for The Avengers and Thor, but by being that, it kinda forgot to be something in it's own. That's the biggest difference to the first flick, who was original, fresh and smart.Sounds pretty much like a bash, but all that being said, I was fairly entertained. The performances of the main characters each were pretty good. The cast was perfect. Of course all the special effects are amazing, with a lot attention to detail. I loved all the 'augmented reality"" stuff going on in Starks garage. The movie is funny (actually it felt more like a comedy than an action flick) and when the action happens, it's looking great. The biggest let down is the potential this movie and most and for all the characters had, which wasn't used. However this is only the review of someone who's fairly unfamiliar with the graphic novel.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","Angelus2","4 May 2010","As a comic book fan, it is hard for me to admit if a certain movie has not met the huge expectations that a comic book fan may hold...Batman Begins, Dark Knight held there own, the X-Men movies not so much, Fantastic Four movies were satisfactory....Daredevil was a travesty...Iron-Man was brilliant.....This sequel, is a 50/50 for me... The beginning was brilliant, the middle was slow and random...and the end was satisfactory.The world now knows Tony Stark is Iron-Man and he lives the high life and battles injustice, but the rest of the world wants Tony's suit. Especially the American government.Robert Downey Jr is funny, charming and a little eccentric, which works with the Stark character. Gwyneth Paltrow is beautiful then ever before, she plays the caring, at times bossy secretary who is the only reason as to why Stark is still running a multi-billion dollar business. Justin Hammer played by Sam Rockwell is funny, annoying; which does wonders for our ever growing love for Stark...Mickey Rourke is satisfactory as the villain who wants to destroy Tony Stark, we don't really feel scared. And it seems that Rourke is a combination of 'Whiplash' and 'Crimson Dynamo'...But for me...Don Cheadle seemed to be out of place, I preferred Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Don Cheadle did not deliver lines very well, he did not have that 'No Nonsense' attitude that Rhodey has....Or it did not come across very well. Lastly, Samuel L.Jackson actually played Nick Fury pretty well, while I would have preferred to see Olga Kruylenko as Natalie Romanov, Scarlett Johanson was fine.The middle for me seemed to be a bit slow with random seems, yes we needed to witness the trials Tony faced but it was not dark enough for me. I would have liked to see Tony battle alcoholism, and then hand over his mantle to Rhodes, who would eventually become 'War-Machine' towards the end of the film.....Make it a little closer to the comics.But, the one thing that sold it to me, actually two things...The suit and the epic battle between Iron-Man, War Machine and the Drones.The special effects were simply dazzling and definitely a must see for all comic book fans.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","Velociraptor256","29 April 2010","At its high points - the first act and the climax - Iron Man 2 is actually better than the first film. Everything up to and including the action scene in Monaco is just great fun to watch: the action, the character interactions, and of course Robert Downey Jr's wonderful portrayal of Tony Stark. And the action scene at the end is pretty epic.The problem is, the film just stops being so much fun in-between. In a large proportion of this time, it's either going too slowly with little happening that's exciting or even particularly interesting, or it's providing some silly moments like Iron Man lounging on a giant display donut. To be fair, there's no problem with the many subplots this movie has: they all blend together quite smoothly.The acting in this film deserves credit: almost everybody does a great job. Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow are just as entertaining as they were in the first film, Jon Favreau gets more to do as Stark's chauffeur, Don Cheadle is actually a little better than Terrence Howard as Rhodie (again, maybe because he has a bigger role), Mickey Rourke portrays a decent but overall ordinary villain, and once Scarlett Johansson is allowed to do something substantial with her own action sequence, she's well worth watching. The only weak link is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, who gets quite annoying after a while.Overall, Iron Man 2's slow middle section prevents it from being better than the first film as a whole, which is a shame considering how brilliant the beginning and end segments are.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","MovieMystro","27 April 2010","The makers of this film held nothing back. When it works, as it does here, it rekindles even a cynic's movie love. So kudos to Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, Scar-Jo, Rockwell, Rourke and especially Favreau. What a film! It is a sight to behold. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on armor action or the charismatic ""down time"" delivered by the best cast possible. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about? It's good to see the response to the movie has been, for the most part, positive. I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. (X-Men and Wolverine fans I'm looking right at you!) Iron Man 2 stayed close enough to its roots and I hope most judge it as a film first. If you do, I'm almost certain that everyone will enjoy it as much as I did. It easily fulfilled and then exceeded all of my expectations. The only thing I worry about is that they may be setting expectations for that Avengers movie too high. How can it possibly live up to the standard these movies are setting and setting up????? Iron Man 2 is EVERYTHING you would want in a movie and much more! It is a special treat when a sequel reaches up and delivers an excellent film that you thoroughly enjoy as much if not more than a beloved first installment. It truly feels like they just paused and kept telling the same story but with more of an edge. Hopefully, they can do it again and skip that third movie curse. Think of it as another installment and they'll be fine. Fitting Avengers in to the mix is even more fun to think about but I heard that Favreau will be involved with that as an executive producer. So, I'm not worried. In the meanwhile, we can all enjoy this film because it stands on its own but as a great part of a running saga.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","sauravjoshi85","7 January 2020","Iron Man 2 is the second part Iron Man movie based on the Marvel Comics characters with the name Iron Man.

The movie might not be able to keep the proficiency of the prequel but still the movie has its dose of adventure.Acting of Robert Downey Jr. has been fantastic with his small one liners will also provide some comic relief. The script may have it's drawbacks but credit should be given to the director to keep it engaging.The movie has also tries to show the emotional Father Son relationship by showcasing senior Stark as a hero and a loving Father.Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson were great, Samuel L. Jackson was surprisingly good and so as Sam Rockwell in a Jealous competitor.The only drawback of the movie is a weak villain although it tried to showcase the villain in a near perfect but the way he dies could've been made more challenging but Mickey Rourke played it's part beautifully.Overall an entertaining high octane movie.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Gordon-11","30 April 2010","This film is about Tony Stark's fight against the US government and a man who wants revenge for what the Stark family did to his father forty years ago.I found ""Iron Man 2"" very entertaining!

Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke also gave amazing performances.I was particularly impressed by the fights at the end.

"Iron Man 2","Romarth","28 April 2010","Reading Iron Man 2's plot summary, things sound bleak for our characters. But not at all. This is a breezy, light-hearted, inoffensive affair that saunters at a magnetic pace, with emotional discomfiting a far thought. Which is pretty refreshing, to say the least. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the complete of antithesis of recent comic book movies. For one, it certainly isn't darker than its predecessor, absent its slow-burning first half and latched-on social commentary. It also gives itself the poetic license to stretch credulity. This is a movie about a man who flies around in metal suit, blasting away multicolored-haired Russians with electric whips. Realism simply doesn't apply, and thankfully director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux take affectionate liberty with the bonds of belief. Yes, Ivan Vanko can secretly build super technology unbeknownst to his suppliers. And yes, the only way to incapacitate a drunken Tony is to beat the crap out of him in a Iron Man suit. No complaints here! Iron Man 2 is also very much Iron Man's superior, although partly by default. The first movie was stuck with a pedantic origin story. However, the sequel had no shortage of possible paths to take. Which did it choose? The way you should always go; the road of characterization. Rather than tediously expand upon its universe, Iron Man 2 simply reprises its dramatis personae and sticks them into situations graver than before, upping the ante but reiterating the overall heart and spirit of its predecessor. The characters are well-etched, each snappy exchange rendered with a mature pathos that contrasts with the spurious scenarios that they feature in between of. Iron Man 2 could easily be called a comedy, but the naturalism of the comedy is seamless; you get the sense that it would be impossible to write this movie without having these vibrant characters joke and jeer.To bring the clever screenplay to life is the phenomenal cast. Robert Downey, Jr., as always, is effortlessly captivating. Charisma defined and an scandalously unsung master of versatility (he's not just playing himself, people!), it's no breaking news that he's still one of the most watchable actors ever. He is the perfect Tony Stark, and a more-than-worthy representative of the thinking man's action star. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow as the pragmatic Pepper Pots is electric, and she too turns in a fine performance. Wistful, but by no means a damsel in distress, she is probably the realest character.The baddies, just as essential as the hero, don't disappoint either. Another wrong from last time round successfully remedied is the lack of genuinely menacing villains. Jeff Bridges honored us with his always-welcome presence in Iron Man, but his warm affability was anything but menacing. This time, however, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell (oddly, both novices to blockbuster attention) are on duty, offering more than enough bang for your villainy buck. Rourke as Anton Vanko/""Whiplash"", supplements a composite of the unintentionally hokey showman, supercilious mastermind, and the seemingly unstoppable behemoth. This effectively fends off one-noteness, and Rourke perfectly embodies the duality of Vanko's deceptively boorish visage and surprisingly vast intellect, while still indulging in the welcome irreverence that comes with the comic book villain (his Russian drawl is humorous but gives him an otherworldly conviction).Rockwell, on the other hand, is flat-out comic relief as Stark's weaselly rival – though not necessarily a threatening one – Justin Hammer. He is excellent in the part; an absolute delight to watch, whether irascibly mugging in a loss for words with his insubordinate partner Vanko or, in one of the movie's best moments, shamelessly accolading his own (faulty) inventions with juvenile zeal.Unfortunately, with all these characters butting heads for screen time, co-stars Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansson as Tony's pal Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes and eventual partner War Machine and alluring temptress of a new assistant Natalie Rushman, respectively, are given the short straw. Both are more than able of carrying a scene, but while the script lavishes Tony with many moments in which to brood his way into some fine character development, and to convey Pepper's many grievances, neither supporting character is as lucky. Cheadle's moments of potential are all obstructed by the War Machine suit, and everything otherwise requires him to lucidly voice reason as a foil to the devil may care Tony. Johansson is a non-event, her Natalie Rushman an amoral nothing role, and her Black Widow guise is not so much daring femme fatale as listless sex symbol. She acts as merely a vessel for fan service, be it in her skintight suit for the general audience or that she represents another stepping stone to an Avengers movie for esoteric comic book fans.The movie is inter cut between the scenes of terse characterization and octane action. The latter is a dizzying combination of rapid vicissitudes and toe-to-toe skirmishes, high on CGI, low on genuine peril. In fact, Iron Man 2 could quite possibly have been a masterpiece of the genre had it lived up to its first forty minutes of exuberance and intrigue. But once the clumsy pugilism of Iron Man and Whiplash takes place, the movie falls flat. The power play is nonexistent, because it's hard to believe anyone could stand a chance against ol' Shellhead. And if no sense of alarm can be conveyed when Iron Man is caught in an unusually melee showdown, the flight sequences leave no impression. Yes, the special effects are astounding, but it's all for nothing if there's no dramatic undercurrent.Otherwise, please, don't mistake my raving for fanboy hyperbole; Iron Man 2 is great. It's well-written, well-acted, and simultaneously a loving throwback to comic book norm and a break from recent tradition. It's a rare occurrence to be thankful for, because God knows if this follows the superhero trilogy formula, the third one will suck. Which would tragically make this movie's thrilling departure from cliché null and void.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","DUKEJBM","27 April 2010","Everyone will rave about the action but Iron Man 2 delivers a beguiling character study behind and above the special effects. You do not leave your I.Q. at the door with this summer movie as you too often need to do. The award winning cast doesn't back down and delivers up to their talent. They're rising to the material, and even elevating it to levels rarely seen in a comic adaptation film. Robert Downey Jr delivers another remarkable performance. Giving one of our generation's greatest actors such a cool character to bring to life happens once in a lifetime. Watching him draw on ALL emotions is as good as it gets. Not to give any spoilers but there's a dark side to Tony Stark because of his impending death and that aspect of the film makes Downey shine. Add the flair and superhero text and we may be talking Oscar. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also bring their top stuff.Aided by those great performances, the writing delivers genuine wit and is strong across the board. I think a lot of summer films are lost in pre-production when they decide to shoot a dumb script or make it up as they go along. Clearly, Iron Man 2 must have had a strong script and great writers. They avoid a lot of the mistakes other films like this make. The story is as good as any comic book adaptation I've ever seen. The plot actually tugs at the heart strings, makes you think and still hits the funny bone more then once. The story and epic battles make perfect sense. What I liked about the first Iron Man is that it was somewhat grounded in reality. No teenage boys or small girls as superheroes or men dressing up as rodents, not that there's inherently anything wrong with those turns. I simply like fantasy grounded in reality. The effects really did surpass what they did before and I actually thought the last time out they deserved FX Oscar consideration. These are some of the best scenes out of any action film ever. Best of all, I couldn't tell what was Computer Generated Images and what was practical.Yes, that's twice I mentioned Oscar so I might as well do it a third time. A nomination for best picture wouldn't surprise me at all at this point. I really loved this movie.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","DKosty123","9 May 2010","In my view, this movie is better than the first installment. There are several reasons for me so naturally I want to list them. I was surprised that all the outrageous trailers for the film turned out to be in the film. Yet they made too much sense & didn't seem quite as outrageous.Robert Downey Jr. is excellent again. He is perfectly in character as Tony Stark. There is an explanation for the outrageous behavior which makes total sense. Clue- if you had all the power on Earth & thought you were going to die, what would you do?There are some nice location shots in this, particularly Monte Carlo.All the supporting cast is back from Iron Man with some excellent additions. Lucas Film effects & Skaywalker sound are much in evidence. To me this film has a more traditional film Hollywood pace. It has perfect spacing between the action sequences & the story sequences. No sequence is too long to get boring. The last half of the first film had a battle sequence that was much too long. People fall in love with computer effects too often.There is a new arch nemesis for Iron Man. See the film & stay all the way until after the credits. There is an additional scene.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","IronBallsM","26 April 2010","Yes, I'm one of the fortunate few who got to see this gem a bit early and I'm happy to report that they took what worked so well in Iron Man and ran with it in an extremely gratifying way. The complexity, depth, heart and action are even more off the charts than the first film. It's is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie period. They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one and built upon it masterfully. Now we get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer weaved with a celebrity who should have never let the cat out of the bag in the final moments of Iron Man 1. They promised to up the action from the first film and they certainly did but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. It has the same flavor and humor of the original and it may even focus more on the fabulous relationships already developed. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film. I didn't think that was possible. Everyone came to play and this great cast brought their best stuff and it shows on screen. Everyone knew Downey, Paltrow and Cheadle could act but Bill O'Reilly and The CNN anchor? Yes, they show up and do a GREAT job in extended cameos. Rourke and Rockwell are PERFECT as the duel foils for Tony Stark, I mean PERFECT. From the Grand Prix in Monaco to the amazing finale, buckle up because this is one intense, interesting, intelligent and fun ride. My only real complaint is that Scarlett's Black Widow has too little screen time. Still, a film that leaves you clamoring for more isn't the worst sin in the world.When I was done viewing this movie, all I could think about was how it instantly stacks up to the all-time great sequels. What was said about classics like Spider-Man 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back, TDK and even Godfather 2 holds true for Iron Man 2. I honestly can't wait to see it again.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","tedg","18 May 2010","Common sense hits the front office at Marvel's adventure in movie-making. Until now, they've just made bad films. Bad.The basic problem, I believe, is that the rest of the world is out exploiting the third dimension and Marvel insists on making flat movies. Even Spidermen, where the character lives and fights in space was flat. All of a sudden, Marvel and ILM wise up. This not only matches but excels what we have at this time in terms of complex three dimensional motion. The camera flies. Objects fly and the two weave in ways new to us. The camera is usually placed in some relatively stationary place to allow you to see what is going on. That place is removed from the action. Sometimes the camera becomes or emulates a POV of a flying or moving object as if it is in the action — or perhaps a character. The game in this new future is a matter of combining the two so that it has the properties of both, but is neither. Done well, it generates pure cinematic excitement. Done well, it overwhelms everything else and thrills because it is so otherworldly. It is done well here. Done well. And it doesn't have to be used to cloud deficiencies elsewhere. All is at least competent and some things: Downey, Rockwell and the production design are excellent.This dimensional thing is done so well that it is mirrored elsewhere. Stark's computers have a hand and voice manipulatable three dimensional, haptic, multiaffordance holographic interface. The motion is less important here than the notion of projected dimensionality. His nemesis? Well, he manages an entire army of drones by a single QWERTY keyboard and a DOS-like display. The contrast is, I think a deliberate thing. They would have pimped up Stark's machine anyway, but having the contrast is a subtle narrative reminder of the difference in dimensionality of the thing.Oh, it is also mirrored in the two women. One is a lighthaired, ponytailed redhead who never leaves the plane. The other is a fiery darker redhead with wild hair (in her real persona) who in a remarkable fight scene is profoundly three-dimensional. Samuel Jackson has decided to do anything, work anywhere, take any pay cut to be the face of the master organization that watches us. I think he knows that this legacy will live for generations, planted in juvenile minds eager for explanatory conspiracies. These theories for some reason rarely are discarded as kids age. It is his face now that is often associated with the leader of the new demigods the genre is creating. Smart building of intellectual property for someone with limited range.Downey. What a guy. Let's hope he takes some of his power to create projects that matter in some way beyond merely thrilling by advancing the craft of seeing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","Hellmant","14 September 2010","'IRON MAN 2': Five Stars (Out of Five) Like many second films in popular fantasy / action franchises (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'SPIDER-MAN 2', 'ALIENS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'X-MEN 2', etc.)'IRON MAN 2' takes what worked about the first film and totally ups the ante and creatively expands on the characters and drama of the first film to probably it's emotional and entertaining peak! It in many ways blows the first film out of the water. Although the action is a lot less frequent than you might expect, from a big superhero blockbuster extravaganza like this, when it does happen it's breathtaking; the race-car fight scene, which happens about a third of the way into the movie, is so cool it's mind-blowing and it's also emotionally intense (It's one of the raddest scenes I've ever seen in a movie and the rest of the movie never quite tops it; so the climax does happen pretty early on but that's OK, there's still plenty of quality movie left even so).What's best about the movie is not the action though it's the character drama and dialog; it would be a crime if this thing doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for best screenplay, although I'm sure that's a crime that will most likely be committed (Robert Downey Jr. also unarguably deserves a nomination for his acting performance as well though). The movie is jam packed with some of the most witty clever dialog and interesting character development I've ever seen in a blockbuster like this! The whole thing is a very complicated psychological character exploration, all revolving around the most fascinating superhero character to ever hit the big screen; the eccentric somewhat mad genius that is Tony Stark (once again insanely but amazingly portrayed by Downey Jr.).The film centers around Stark's battles (not with bad guys and world threats, but) with health issues (he's being poisoned to death by the machine he created, in his chest, that initially saved him), alcoholism, a Government that wants to take control of his technology for what they say is the good of the country and his overall fight to keep his sanity dealing with all this stress. Throw in Sam Rockwell as an impressively portrayed billionaire tech rival and Mickey Rourke as a soft spoken madman bent on revenge against the Stark family, who he blames for stealing his father's ideas, and you've got a complete circus act of oddly interesting characters. There's also Don Cheadle cleverly taking over the role of Stark's best friend James Rhodes (although Terrence Howard in the first film was better), there's a little Samuel L. Jackson being cool like always and there's some more Jon Favreau (more than the first film) that adds some nice comedic touches. There is a very sexy Scarlett Johansson playing another super hero named 'Black Widow' but the female characters are a little underdeveloped compared to the men.You can tell it was written by a man (actor Justin Theroux who's only other writing credit is co-writing 'TROPIC THUNDER', another Downey Jr. scene stealer); the women dialog is mostly important plot advancement stuff but with the guys 80 percent of it could have been tossed and the plot would have been intact but it's just so natural and entertaining; like real people shooting the breeze! That's the brilliance of the film! Favreau has also come pretty far as a director; he's much more polished now and knows what's most important to the film. The whole movie just has an energy to it that can't quite be described in words. It's an astonishing film going experience if you really like film!Watch our review show, 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxp3NkMebd8","1/10"
"Iron Man 2","evan_harvey","3 May 2010","Just saw Iron Man 2, and while I thought the first one was a bit overrated, I had hopes. They quickly dissipated.Firstly, there was no theme. The first Iron Man had a theme - it was about Tony Stark changing his life and becoming a better man. Iron Man 2 had no theme at all.Secondly, the plot was messy: there just happens to be another brilliant scientist who can build an advanced power source in a squalid Moscow shack? Okay, we had to swallow that Tony Stark could build one in the middle of freakin' Afghanistan, but twice? That's too much.Weren't Pepper and Tony supposed to get together at the end of the first film? In this one they stay at arm's length, and I wondered if there was any romance there at all. That scene from the preview where Pepper kisses his helmet and Tony jumps from the back of the plane after it? Gone.The Avengers? Samuel L Jackson with an eye patch? Who the hell wears an eye patch today and doesn't get laughed at? Why introduce paper-thin characters that really do nothing? And it's not like anything actually happened with them anyway, so why waste out time and goodwill?Thirdly, the film didn't really go anywhere in terms of advancing the Iron Man story. There were a few interesting concepts - what does Iron Man do now that everyone knows who he is? Will the US military get their hands on it? - but these, while addressed, where never really given much thought. Instead, Tony's best friend (Cheadle) steals the other suit. What? Even after being given an order to do so, why would his friend do that?Fourth, the acting: Gwenyth Paltrow is a terrible actress. So it Scarlett Johansson, but at least she's smoking hot. Don Cheadle is no Terrance Howard. While Howard himself isn't a great actor, he owned the role in Iron Man 1. Cheadle just didn't have the personality and charisma, and you'll note he gets very little screen time too.It wasn't a completely horrible film, but it wasn't worth the 7.9 IMDb gives it. Much closer to a flat 5.0. The direction is a bit messy - the action scenes aren't as clean as they should be. Some great SXF, as you'd expect. Save your money for the DVD.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","g-bodyl","30 September 2010","I went in the theaters with an open mind ready to expect the best and that is what I got. Iron Man 2 is just as good maybe even better than the first one. Robert Downey Jr is superb as Tony Stark once again. I also loved the performance by Mickey Rourke as Whiplash. I didn't expect much out of him. And of course we all know why Scarlett Johansson is here.This movie takes place right after Stark becomes public. He has to deal with the government who wants to take his suit and Whiplash who wants to kill him because of his father, Howard.I loved everything here. I enjoyed the action, the chicks, the cars, the special effects, and much more. The only thing I really hated was that Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard. I love Cheadle's acting but Howard was perfect in the first one.Overall, this is a fantastic sequel. I hope they make Iron man 3 and I can't wait until the Avengers in two years. I rate this film 10/10.","1/10"
"Iron Man 2","drakula2005","30 April 2010","At first, when a heard about a second installment, i thought, i was unsure in it, because Jon Favreau is relatively new on the director's chair, so could he pull of another classic superhero movie?The answer is simple-YES! I saw it in its opening day and the theatre was full.I went along with a few friends, and all of them loved it!Here are some things, we all agreed we liked.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:It was pretty good in this movie-making aspect, although it is an action movie, there is some quite exciting development, especially the leads.Don Cheadle made a perfect substitute of Terrence Howard, and looked pretty good in the movie.So did the Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlet Johansson's heroines.For me, Scarlet is one of the most gifted and talented and in the same time, the most beautiful actresses in the last decade and even more.And last, but not least, of course, the Iron Robert Downey Jr., making one of his unique, specifically for him, roles.He is smart, funny and in the same time, well, action hero type of guy-he adds so much to this otherwise, stereotyped role.Sam Rockwell was a little irritating, but that's what his role is supposed to be, and to those who have doubts, yes, Mickey Rourke made a decent and interesting role again.TIMING:Almost perfect, except, maybe, the opening credits and a few over timed scenes afterwards, everything was alright and on the perfect spot.PLOT/STORY:I finally can say it-YES, the day has come.A day, where superhero movies haven't got just CGI, put a pretty decent story, attached to the normal amount of CGI.Well, hard to say normal, a little bit over-the-top, but nonetheless fun, when you get use to the headache.The humor was perfect, brilliantly touched to the smallest line.And most importantly-it's not that predictable-i don't mean the ending, but the development, leading to it.Excecutet skilfully, when looked from this point of view.CGI:10/10, nothing else to add.Believable Flawless.Perfect.With no big flaws or plot holes, very funny dialogue, skillful acting and good directing, Iron Man is definitely the best movie of the year so far.The perfect blockbuster as well.I'm glad a saw it, and if the first one didn't made me a fan, this one did.I can't wait to see it again.Cheers to Iron Man Amazing! I would've given this a ten, but with some very few weaknesses, i'll lower this a little, although it did make me a bigger fan than before...My rate: 7.5/10","1/10"
"Iron Man 2","sarastro7","30 April 2010","I liked the first Iron Man movie quite a bit, but there was a good deal of things in it that I was critical of. I felt that several bits didn't work very well, and the level of excitement just wasn't that great.They sure remedied that in the sequel!! Okay, so Scarlett Johansson didn't have much to do. Okay, so a couple of minor scenes were less than realistic (like, why do Happy and Pepper stay in the wrecked car during the fight when they could just run to safety - that sort of thing). And okay, so the drone army was not that threatening and didn't pack much of a punch. Aaand, Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer was played a little bit too much for laughs. But these are very minor things. The overall mesh of plot lines, character interactions, comic book references, humor, action and sheer visual candy combined to produce the greatest entertainment value of any Marvel-based superhero movie yet. Hot damn!One of the things I liked best was the ""slow"" part in the middle where Tony watched the old film from his father, and found the structure of the new element in the ""key to the future"" model city (a city which had also actually been built, and in the center of which the climactic battle took place). Great effects, great plot element! :-) And the particle accelerator he threw together; that was massively great fun for me!There were a long list of comic book references in this movie that everyone who hasn't read the comics will naturally have missed. For instance, the reason they turned Justin Hammer into the Sam Rockwell type (Rockwell tends to play the same character, always sporting his trademark Nervous Chuckle) was to make him a comical element. In the comics that character is older and tough and very confident, but the movie version consciously parodied him in order to add more humor to the movie. Not that it needed it; it had plenty to go around!I just don't have any rally major gripe about this movie; I thought it was fabulous entertainment and much better than the first. Who SEZ this isn't the Mighty Marvel Age of Great Comic Book Movies?!9 out of 10.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","planktonrules","7 July 2010","About three days before I went to see ""Iron Man 2"", I watched the original ""Iron Man"" for the second time. This time, my 20 year-old watched it with me. She'd never seen it before and loved it--thanking me for recommending it to her. And, considering that I not only saw the film twice (that's very rare for me) and gave it a 9 in my review, I obviously was stoked to see the sequel. Too bad I was so underwhelmed by it.While my daughter said she also liked this film and said Tony Stark (Rober Downey, Jr.) was a jerk like he was in the comic books, I though he was simply a jerk--and perhaps my not reading the comic book made it harder for me to take this bothersome portrayal. Now I am NOT saying I expected him to be perfect--after all, in the first film he was truly irresponsible and sarcastic. But, in ""Iron Man 2"", you also liked him despite, or perhaps because of these flaws! In this sequel, that likable roguish quality was missing...he was simply an annoying and self-indulgent jerk. Now my perception is not everyone's, I know. Perhaps it's because I am 46 (a bit old for this sort of film) and because I haven't read a comic book in 35 years. Whatever the reason, I found it hard to love the film when I disliked the leading man so much. Heck, while he was very one-dimensional, it was often easier to like the baddie (Mickey Rourke)!! At least he had some sense of purpose in life other than his own misguided narcissism.My other serious problem with the film is the over-reliance on special effects. Too often, the film simply overloaded my senses--as it seemed bent on topping the eye-popping images of the first film. And, while it did this clearly, it did so at the expense of the plot and, more importantly, character development. As a result, I just can't see this film as anything more than eye-candy for the very easily amused and not a film with any serious depth--something that was NOT a problem with ""Iron Man"". Watch it if you want...just don't expect a lot of magic.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","claudio_carvalho","26 September 2010","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) discloses to the world that he is the Iron Man and the senate presses him to deliver his technology to military purpose but Tony refuses telling that he has brought peace to the world. Meanwhile, the evil Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) surprises the world attacking the Iron Man in Monaco with his armored suit. Ivan is arrested but Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) releases him simulating his death. Meanwhile Tony is depressed expecting to die sooner and Lieutenant Colonel James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) steals an armored suit from Tony and brings it to the army. The high command delivers the technology to Justin Industry to weapon the armor and Ivan builds an army of remote controlled suit of armors. ""Iron Man 2"" is a festival of special effects and shattered glasses. The hero Tony Stark is an unpleasant and arrogant character and the film is recommended for fans of Transformers and explosions.

"Iron Man 2","badajoz-1","5 May 2010","Just when I thought it was safe to go back into the cinema, after the dreadfully boring disappointment of 'Avatar,' I go to see something even worse - 'Iron Man 2.' How can Hollywood spend trillions on such product? It is absolutely uninteresting, except for whether Gwyneth Paltrow is wearing her killer heels in some shots but not in others, with little action, appalling script, lax direction, and mindless high tech imagery. We spend over the first hour while Robert Downey jnr calls on all his past personal indiscretions to try and portray a super hero who is falling apart because he is dying - cue, inaudible supposedly smart ass dialogue with characters talking over each other, which is absolutely a killer and not worthy of all that Hollywood has done in the past hundred years!!!!!!!!!!!!! This film stinks, the action is useless, so-called invincible super killer drones (actually robocop lookalikes) are mown down in two seconds flat (Get bored did you, JON?), the characters not worth bothering with, repetitious to the Nth degree, and the villain (Mickey Rourke picking up his pension money)keels over inside a minute! Miss it if you can - luckily I only paid £3 or $4.50 so I got away with it.

"Iron Man 2","Egg_MacGuffin","20 May 2010",".SPOILERS WITHIN. ----------------- Take note, ladies and gentlemen. This is what happens when you rush a sequel into production without first having a quality script...or even a good script. This is simply a poor movie. No doubt that it's fun, but when the fundamentals are not there, you still end up dissatisfied.What is Tony Stark's goal? This is the most important part of any film story and here, it's missing. How does this happen? You can argue that his goal is to stop Whiplash, but Whiplash is never threatening anybody apart from the Monaco scene and the extreme end of the story, which is too few and far between to function as a proper goal for Stark. You can argue that his goal is to find the cure to his blood toxicity to keep himself alive, but he is only actively working toward that goal for less than 5 minutes, most of which is spent on a gag with Captain America's shield. Then he cures himself with such ease, all tension and conflict is completely killed. SO that can't be his goal, either. Hell, he spent more time driving around for the Audi commercial, which ironically meant as much to the remainder of the story as the new power cell - nothing.What is the villain's plan? First of all, who the hell is the villain: Whiplash or Justin Hammer? Hammer simply wants a defense contract, which poses a threat of zero to Stark if he succeeds in getting the contract. Whiplash has a pasted-in motivation that is as weak as a wet noodle. He fights Stark at the racetrack and then spends the remainder of the movie sitting in a room on the other side of the country, not threatening anybody at all (until the very end). It's good that he showed up with a security uniform on the off-chance that Stark would be driving a race car that day. Did anybody see where logic went? So with no villain posing any kind of threat to Stark for the entire second act of the story, and Stark having no goal of his own, we're left with a jumbled mess in the middle of the film. Stark acts out and does nothing remotely interesting or exciting because he simply has nothing else to do. His conflict with Pepper was so manufactured, I could almost hear the clatter of an assembly line every time they were together. It was entirely non-emotional, and because of that, I couldn't care.The hero and villain don't even encounter one another at all in the second act of this movie! They are off on their own doing boring crap instead.Nick Fury shows up and drops information in Stark's lap instead of Stark actually finding out for himself. Then Fury is basically gone for the remainder of the movie. Whatever the hell Scarlett Johansson's character's name was served no purpose at all. Why were these characters even in the movie? I know Scarlett was in because she got to wear tight leather and kick ass, which I personally loved, but I would appreciate it a bit more if it was somewhat story-related. Of course, you need a story first.You can argue that Scarlett had to stop Whiplash from maintaining control of the War Machine suit, but I don't even know how Whiplash gained control of it to begin with! We are never presented with that information. And if he can control War Machine, why not take control of Stark's suit? Hello? Logic? Where did you go? Logic, come back! The climax involves an long fight with drones, which becomes nothing more than robots slugging each other. In the first film, Stark was battling the technology that he created and had to learn to outsmart his opponent because he couldn't outgun him. Here, it's just mindless action. There is no threat of danger. The drones pose a threat as severe as a field mouse. Then Whiplash shows up to a scene where a battle was already fought, and they have another battle that is twice as short as the one with the drones. If you blink, you'll miss it. There is no struggle. No reversals. No tension. No anything.Why can't we have a summer action movie that is both fun and good? You can even site the first Iron Man as an example. What happened here? This movie is a complete joke and a borderline insult.But I think we all know by now that Hollywood only makes sequels because they want money, not because they have a story worth telling...or a story at all.If I didn't see this movie for free, I'd ask for my money back on account of a faulty product.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","DJAkin","16 May 2010","This movie was everything that Iron Man 1 was not. Yes, it was terrible, predictable and irritating. I was so mad how they essentially didn't even show any super hero stuff for 90% of the movie. The children in the theater kept asking their mother's: ""Mommy, where is Iron Man? I thought this was Iron Man mommy?"". The mothers had to calm their children. It was so sad. What was even more irritating was how conceited Tony Stark was. I was kind of amused by how the senator kept harassing him. For 55% of the movie - Tony Stark was pompous and an ass. He was not even remotely amusing. Then of course there is the villain who was played by an obviously uninspired Mickey Roark hoping to cash in on the success of his hit The Wrestler. He basically had a horrible Russian accent and had LIGHT SABER BULL WHIPS as a weapon. This movie was terrible. I want to sue the makers of this movie for the two hours I wasted by watching it. How am I able to get this time back? It was painful to watch this.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","pinkliz41","30 April 2010","The hype for Iron Man 2 to be great was pretty big, by me anyway. But i was let down considerably. Sequels are usually the ones that are much harder to get right and pull of, and Iron Man 2 nearly falls flat. The last thirty minutes are diabolically bad compared to the rest of the film, which, whilst it lasted, was pretty damn good. Things that could have certainly been improved upon were; Mickey Rourke as Whiplash, who i didn't think had enough screen time, and could have been fleshed out slightly better. The introduction of War Machine fighting alongside his ally Iron Man, was completely inappropriate as it made the climactic fight sequence corny and stupid. His fight with Iron Man at Starks home was also un called for, as if the director was adding the sequence just for the sake for a longer running time. Also, Starks witty personality died out pretty quickly, so we are left annoyed and pleading him to stop by the credits.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","warthogjump","2 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is a great flick, not doubt about it. But, unfortunately, it fails to live up to hype and expectations of the first Iron Man.There were enjoyable action scenes in Iron Man 2. However, they didn't feel as compelling as the first one. Through each and every action scene, it's easily predictable that Iron Man will just win, so that does take out most of the enjoyment from them.There is a lot of humorous and satisfying dialogue throughout. This is probably mainly due to the stellar cast. Robert Downey is perfect, again! Sam Rockwell was probably my favourite actor in this movie as he mixes evil and comedy up very nicely. Most people didn't like him because of his attitude, but personally, he's acting is wonderful.ScarJo is sexy, but that's about it. She isn't really given much to work with and the one long action scene she is provided with seems too forced and clichéd to have any powerful affect. Don Cheadle's just there, he's not great and he's not bad, nothing too fancy about him.Samuel L. Jackson is provided with very little screen time, but I assure you, he delivers just like you would expect him to deliver. The ring on the tone of his voice is impeccable.Mickey Rourke is a fantastic villain and he really had me satisfied in every scene, but it was quite unfortunate how quickly and easily he lost the final battle. Blame the writers on that one. Using an actor with so much potential, but failing to use him to his full potential, that's just a shame.That's the acting side of it. Right about now, I'd probably give the movie an 8. But the biggest problem Iron Man 2 had is, in my opinion, the lack of continuing the storyline.A storyline was introduced with Tony's father and Rourke's father. It was mentioned here and there. Samuel L. Jackson also played particular attention to Tony's father. Yet, in the end, a storyline that was built up significantly from the beginning and the middle had hardly any affect towards the end, if any. It's almost like it was forgotten about and was merely introduced to by time. That was disappointing.Overall, Iron Man 2 will satisfy your hunger, but it will leave the dessert compartment empty and unsatisfied as it lacks many of the elements that made Iron Man 1 such a big surprise.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","Jackpollins","8 May 2010","After the surprisingly fantastic Iron Man, old and new faces join forces for Iron Man 2, an equally fantastic sequel. After long months of waiting for this film, it exceeded my expectations and made me want the Iron Man series to be never ending. There's something about Robert Downey Jr's sarcastic tone and out there charisma that suits this character (no pun intended). Mickey Rourke & Sam Rockwell are now villains Ivan & Justin, two competitors of Tony Stark (Downey, JR). Don Cheadle plays James Rhodes, AKA Warhead, Scarlett Johansson plays Natalie, Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury, Jon Favreau plays Happy, Paul Bettany plays Jarvis, Leslie Bibb plays Christine, and Garry Shandling plays Senator Stern. Guess what? They're all excellent. Shandling, especially, who has some of the funniest lines I have seen thus far this year. Rockwell has one of the funniest opening scenes in the film. There's so much to like about Iron Man 2, that, although not flawless, you forget its flaws, and just enjoy the spectacular ride you are to have. I can't decide what I want first, for Iron Man 3 to come out or for this to be in my DVD collection. Either way, see this film right away.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","moneelvarjan","28 April 2010","Just came back from the mid night premier of the new Iron Man movie. And i have to say it lives up to all the hype that is has created.I'll try not to add any spoilers but please take note that it may contain just a few small ones.Firstly this movie doesn't feel like a second chapter in the Iron Man franchise, it feels more like a continuation of the first movie. Unlike the batman movies where begins and TDK feel like two complete different chapters of the same book, this feels more like chapter 1 part 2 of the first iron man movie.Secondly, Don Cheadle made a brilliant James Rhodes. His performance captured the character much better than Howards' did. I really wish they could have cast Cheadle from the get go. The rest of the performances were excellent as well Scarlett made a very good Black Widow for her first time i think it was very good, hopefully if she is in the third movie she will work on improving the character a bit more.Overall the movie is a great balance between the action, the comedy and the more serious points of the overall plot. Jon Favreau and his team of writers perfectly balanced all the wonderful and sometimes heavy plot lines that have been enjoyed in the comics and brought them all together in this movie. Its brilliant. I give it a 10 out 10, i left the movie feeling very satisfied and i think most fans of the comics and the movies so far will too. Oh just a tip. If your a real fan stay till after the credits roll.","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","taylorkingston","26 May 2015","I think I like this movie as much as the first one, it's not better, it's not worse. It's a pretty entertaining movie and I really enjoy it.Now that the world knows the identity of Tony Stark and that he's really Iron Man, people have constantly been trying to recreate the Iron Man suit for their own personal gain. And the government tries to get Tony to hand over his, like that would ever happen. Tony continues to save the day until a man comes out of nowhere, with a similar suit and wreaks havoc. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","sidfargas","4 May 2010","Iron Man 2 delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining humor, a complex plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Iron Man 2 is such a movie. Much like the first film, it's truly deep and complex but sacrifices none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Mark my words; Iron Man 2 is a movie people will be talking about all year if not for years to come. Iron Man 2 delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","sacflyzone","29 April 2010","This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2010, quite possibly the number one film. I really can't see anything that could possibly top this film. One of my favorite movie going experiences EVER. I was thrilled with Iron Man back in 2008 but this takes that experience and adds to it. I'm so happy to report that unlike other sequels made only for a cash grab, Iron Man 2 delivers on every front possible. There is no doubt why IM2 will be the box office smash of 2010. With good reason, the film is well worth the price of admission, more so then any movie I've seen in years. Director Jon Favreau has done it again, with great style and flair. The new actors are injected perfectly. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell and even good old Garry Shandling are exceptional. We all knew Scarlett Johansson could handle the sex appeal but she's especially good as Tony's new assistant/SHIELD operative. Don Cheadle trumps Terrance Howard's Rhodey in every way. I'm also relieved to report that Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Paltrow are even more amazing in their lead roles. They've really grown in to embodying these wonderful characters. What many don't realize but soon will is that this film has tremendous depth. The lead characters all respond to turmoil and are fleshed out beautifully. Judging by the commercials, people may expect wild action but they are going to be pleasantly surprised at the complexity and depth of the film itself. What only adds to the experience is the fact that they managed to deliver fun in to the equation. This masterpiece is one of those rare summer event movies that really does deliver something for everyone.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Medacakathareal","7 May 2010","The new Iron Man sequel has attracted quite a bit of hype. Most of us were surprised back in 2008 that the first film had turned out not only bearable but pretty solid. The first film had walked the line between serious origin story and self-spoofing comic book comedy. The new film does the same and walks the delicate line between tension and comedic relief just as well as its predecessor.Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark one of the first super-heroes to forgo a secret identity. This eliminates what I feel is one of the weakest gimmicks of the superhero genre, the secret identity to ""protect your loved ones"". Ever notice how Peter Parker doesn't want to tell MJ who he is because she'd be in danger BUT she ends up in danger anyway? Same for Lois Lane or Rachel Dawes in Nolan's batman films. Iron Man doesn't bother with the secret identity and the story is better off for it. Instead the film focuses on the actual character of Tony Stark, including the character flaws he is known for and his relationship with his Father.The plot is really about the ""Sins of the Father"" passing on to the son. The Father of the film's villain has been wronged by Stark's Father and this leads to a high-tech revenge story. The acting is okay although I felt the script, at times, gave the actors little to work with. Even in the scenes that were fizzling out into boredom a joke or two would be thrown in to spice things up and reengage the audience. Whoever they had treat the script did a bang up job with quips, innuendos, gags and one-liners a plenty. These corny quips would be out of place in most movies but in a summer comic book blockbuster they are a MUST.Cheadle takes over from Terrence Howard as Colonel James Rhodes and while I feel he lacks the charisma Howard exuded in the first film he still does a solid job as Tony's new sidekick. The film also goes deeper into Tony's involvement with SHIELD, the legendary organization that will eventually set up the AVENGERS. Scarlett Johansson also does well in her role though honestly her beauty leaped off the IMAX screen so much I could barely concentrate on her dialogue when she was on screen.All in all the plot clips along nicely, never dwelling on the boring for too long but not letting the fast pace of the film take away from telling a good story. The Special Effects are incredible of course and some of the action scenes had the audience I saw the film with applauding. I feel the film lives up to its predecessor in almost every way and is easily worth an 8 out of 10. A solid superhero movie. I hope to see more of Iron Man on the big screen.Also, stay after the credits for a mini-sneak peak of one of the next super-heroes to get his own movie.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","Pumpkin_Man","8 May 2010","I thought this movie was awesome and just as good as the original. It's filled to the brim with action, explosions, suspense, and comedy. The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!","1/10"
"Iron Man 2","Matt_Layden","8 February 2011","People faulted this film for being good, but not great. What the hell, so will I. Iron Man 2 has all the right ingredients to make a great summer blockbuster superhero film, yet the final product is more of what we already saw, minus the heart. Iron Man 2 has Tony Stark AKA Iron Man fighting off Ivan Vanko, a man hellbent on revenge, as well as a new arms dealer Justin Hammer. For the sake of cramming more characters in sequels, like all sequels do, we also have Natasha Romanoff/Natalie Rushman, better known as Black Widow. Black Widow, or the eye candy known as Scar Jo, adds nothing to the film for me. This was one of my worries, too much going on. Iron Man isn't overloaded like X-3 was, but it was getting there. The story is the classic revenge tale, with Mickey Rourke as the villain. A role he was only given because of his recent career revival with The Wrestler. If you watch The Expendables, you'll notice he looks exactly the same as he does here. Almost as if they were shooting next door and he wandered onto the set. Ivan, isn't that memorable as a villain (looks don't count). Rourke tried his best, but there just wasn't much there in the script. The action set pieces are entertaining enough to appeal to a younger audience. The threat level doesn't feel as big, with the addition of War Machine, again more stuff added, it just felt like we were waiting for Iron Man to succeed. The stakes simply weren't high enough for me to really care this time around.The party scene with Tony in the Iron Man suit, drunk and shooting off missiles in his house was laughable and was just added to have the two character fight each other. Superhero sequels tend to be a but better (X2, Spiderman 2) but this one just dropped the ball a bit. I don't know if the first one set the bar too high or if the filmmakers were just a bit lazy. Either way, we lost out a bit on this one.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Villings","30 April 2010","There's RDJ and his immeasurable charisma, there's Rockwell and Rourke rocking their lines, there's classy Paltrow and shallow ScarJo (bait for the horny nerds), there's good action.. and yet, something's missing. Don't get me wrong: this movie is FUN, from beginning to end. Too much talking? No way. Not enough action? Maybe, but there's plenty (2 fights, 1 'friend ruckus'). But the thread that ties it all together don't seem to be that strong (I blame it on Theroux). Anyway, go see it, you won't regret. One more thing: don't believe people telling that this movie talks way too much about the Avengers: a few bits here and there is not too much. And stay for the after-credits scene.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","Faizan","1 May 2010","In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark's ego swells to enormous levels. Written as some kind of Steve Jobs meets Richard Branson amalgam in a superhero costume, Robert Downey's wise-ass treatment of the character (still at tangents to what he represents in the original comics) seems self absorbed and cheeky. How could anyone find him likable as a hero? But beyond all of this is a simple fact, this sequel fails to do what every sequel must i.e. expand on the original and take the premise into uncharted territory.Stripped down in this second outing to its bare essentials - one liners and scant cartoonish action - the films defects (glaringly obvious even in the first) conspicuously swell and rise to the surface. The story puts Stark in mortal danger; the miniature arc reactor that keeps him alive is now poisoning his body, discharging lethal toxins that weaken him and leave limited time to find a cure. Amidst this he finds himself embroiled in a wrangle with the US government over the ownership of the Iron Man armour and what it represents (weapon or instrument of peace). If all of this weren't enough, he is threatened by the random appearance of Mickey Rourke's Ivan Vanko, who as Whiplash thumps Start and his Iron Man armour in the movies best scene, set in an over-crowded Monaco racetrack.Once the initial dust has settled though, the film turns into a self absorbed, faux character study. This superhero Bucket List setup, where our hero may be dying and therefore disregards all concerns about his image and worldly perception, does not make for good entertainment. Even with all its flaws, the original film never sank to a level where it didn't amuse us, whether it was in exploring (but also exploiting) the socio-political landscape of the war on terror or Stark's guilt-stricken conscience, bruised by the extent of his organizations exploits. Because director Jon Favreau is no Sam Raimi, even his attempts at parodying the character (ala Spiderman 3) in self deprecation mode – with Tony Start dancing around in full armour on his birthday - feels embarrassingly unfunny. For action junkies, the cluttered night time scenes with Stark and Jim Rhodes (underwhelming Don Cheadle in armour as War Machine) lack the aerial panache of Iron Man fighting it out with Jet Fighters from the original.The film makes one fact glaringly obvious; comic book movies are not comic books themselves, they are movies and are expected to function in ways that films do. That Iron Man 2 doesn't is a failure that stems out of its short-sightedness to connect itself to something bigger and greater. Intended as a tie in to the upcoming, proposed (and so far non- existent) Avengers movie, it instead becomes filler for it. The movies tone implies it is a setup for the teams ultimate formation, and the blink and miss appearance of Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer, intended to provide drug like highs in audiences viewing pleasure, only confirms this observation. This is not a film but bait for a much bigger commercial franchise on the horizon and depending on how you see it, you will either enjoy it or feel duped by it.","2/10"
"Iron Man 2","Aaron1375","13 May 2010","This film did almost the same amount of business as the first film, but a lot of people consider it an inferior film. I am not one of those people, I actually think it is just as good as the first film. The first film had a bit more polish, but this one had more bang for your buck as the last action sequence in this film has more action than all of the cation scenes in the first film put together. They did recast Rhodes in this film substituting Don Cheadle for Terrance Howard, but quite frankly I thought it was an improvement. Cheadle just has a better presence than Howard and though they recast the role because Howard wanted more money, I think it worked in favor of the studio because Cheadle is a better actor. All the other primary players are accounted for as Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark/Iron Man and Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts. The two do great as a very eccentric pair and I thought Mickey Rourke as the villain was an improvement over Bridges in the first film. I just am not seeing what others saw that make them say that this film is a worse film than the first one.The story has a man in Russia with ties to Tony's father blaming the Stark family for all the misery that he and his now dead father have had to endure. He designs his own reactor and a pair of whip like weapons. Meanwhile, Tony is having problems as the U.S. government wants the Iron Man suit and the reactor in his chest is killing him at a rapid rate. So, thinking his time is limited, Tony goes crazy trying to live every moment as if it was his last. This leads to him to giving away his possessions, wearing his Iron Man suit to his birthday party and driving a race car. It is during the race that he first comes face to face with the new villain Ivan Vanko. Vanko is stopped by Iron Man, but his stay in prison is shortened when Justin Hammer, who is desperately trying to design his own Iron Man suit springs him in the hopes Vanko can create him the suit he yearns for. Tony soon gets information on a way to save himself and it all culminates at an all out battle at the newly opened Stark expo.The movie to me was fun as they brought back most of the cast and as I said, I thought the one they had to recast was an improvement. Also, introduced in this film is Natasha Romanoff who gets to showcase her skills a bit in this film. A lot more than Hawkeye would get to showcase his in his first appearance in the first Thor film. I enjoyed the Iron Man suitcase armor in the first fight with Vanko and I liked how Vanko looked in that fight as well. Something primal as a man with just a couple of whips and slight enhancers on the body trying to challenge the hero.Once again, not sure why this one is thought of as inferior. Tony was dying, that is why he reverted a bit to the jerky out of control self. He was just trying to enjoy his last days. I heard a lot of complaining that the final fight with Vanko was not long enough, but that was only one portion of the final action scene. Before that you had Iron Man being chased by drones while Romanoff was kicking butt at Hammer industries and then you had Iron Man and War Machine fighting against the horde of drone robots. Like I stated earlier, this final action scene was long and had a lot going on. The humor was still good and there was still heart to it. To me, this film is just as good as the original and the action was actually better.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","deason","29 April 2010","Tony (Iron Man) Stark and supporting cast have been continuously published for up to almost half a century now; there must be something entertaining and appealing about these characters. This movie (unlike some other comicbook adaptions this century - yes, ""Azrael Begins"", I'm looking at you) actually puts recognisable versions of the published characters on the big screen.If you've been reading Iron Man for decades, as I have, then there are many resonant moments and stirring visuals that will bring a smile to your face. I don't think you can go much more than 5 minutes at a stretch without experiencing some frisson of gleeful recognition.If all you know of the character is the first movie, this will not disappoint. It has the same mix of comicbook physics, great performances and entertaining action in another script smarter than the genre usually supplies. There's a layer of enjoyment accessible to long-time readers that you won't tap into, but you won't miss it.(It was great to see Howard Stark presented as the Walt Disney of the Marvel Universe here! Great cultural shorthand.) Superior popcorn entertainment masterfully done!","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","bjornjohren","29 April 2010","I went to the premiere last night and maybe it's because I've just discussed the movie with some friends that I'm still excited about it, but I truly enjoyed it. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll only state that there's old,new and more depth. That said I may be a bit on the generous side regarding my score, but it contains some of my favorite actors and the performances to go along with it. Downey Jr performance is excellent and Rourke(!) is still a hero, though my Russian is much better. ;) The incredibly beautiful ladies in this movie are as stated. One thing I thought was a pity was that Scarlett Johansson could've been given more time on the big screen, but maybe next movie will sort that out. I'm not one to criticize the directors vision and I won't, seeing as it's like the last movie, but more fun stuff. The Stark character has some funny moments that you don't want to end. Cheadle and Downey seems to have a chemistry that really works, but it may be good performances (what acting is all about). Marvel action at its best and yes... I'm easily amused.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","brockparks","10 May 2010","I liked it a lot better than the mixed reviews I was reading would have led me to believe. It's not as fresh as the original, but the charisma and humor were there, and so were some great surprises. RDJ was amazing as always - it's hilarious that Iron Man is a funnier superhero than Spiderman, but the improv makes it work. Thumbs up! I think that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will like this as well, and enjoy a great thrill ride! And don't forget to stay after the credits for yet another Marvel movie tie-in that leads towards the inevitable Avengers movie in 2012! Don Cheadle did a good job - ScarJo was good, but not what I imagined the Black Widow to be like, but she *was* hot... And Gwyneth did her usual impeccable job. Mickey Rourke added weight to what could have been a cardboard cutout stereotype, and Sam Rockwell's character, though annoying, was well played.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","jcdugger","10 May 2010","Repeat: There's a turd in the punch bowl! This movie is a microcosm of everything wrong with Hollywood...and, unfortunately, humans in general.You see, in the most basic terms possible...people are, for the most part, stupid. There are far more of these stupid people on Earth than intelligent ones. So, if you want to sell something to these people, like a movie, you need to dial-down the intelligence level of the product. (In this way, Iron Man 2 succeeds!) For instance, let's say you want to sell a product to a group of Sarah-Palin-backing Tea Baggers. You already know, without ever meeting any of them, that this a group of people who supports a brainless political creation, one who doesn't even belong to the Tea Bagger party! (High intelligence there, eh?!) So if you were to invent a t-shirt with a saying on it, with the intention of selling it to a Tea Bagger...would you create an articulate, detailed argument on the t-shirt...or would you create something that appeals to the lowest common denominator? Would your t-shirt say something smart and factual like ""90% of Tea Baggers got a tax cut under Obama!"". Or would you just put Obama on the shirt with a Hitler mustache?! Which one is going to sell better? Same thing here with ""Iron Man 2"". A producer COULD spend $200 Million on something highly intelligent and with some redeeming value -- and sell less tickets -- or that same producer could spend the $200 Million on a bunch of special effects, A-list stars and explosions -- and sell more tickets. So, intelligent people (I'm assuming if you have read this much, you're probably more intelligent than most), we get stuck with these sorry excuses for movies all the time! And I, for one, am sick of it! Where does Iron Man 2 go wrong? Where to begin?! First off, Mickey Rourke looks like a feminine version of ""Professor Chaos""! Where did they come up with that suit design, the Johnny Weir collection?! And Gwyneth Paltrow? How does she keep getting work?! She's the ""Mark Harmon"" of actresses! In one scene, she seductively kisses the Iron Man mask -- with no human in it! (Imagine her horror when she read the script for the first time and came across that scene!) I almost felt bad for her...then I reminded myself that she is Gwyneth Paltrow! Next in line for this money-grab excuse of a movie is the usually brilliant Robert Downey Jr. If his performance were any more wooden, his nose would grow when he lied!!In my opinion, there has only been one Comic Book movie worthy of a ""10"" rating and that was ""Batman Begins"". Iron Man 2 falls woefully short of that standard. A big step back from Iron Man 1 even. Don't let the fancy CGI and big explosions fool you...this is a clunker! Thank you for reading! JD","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","vinnie2112","27 April 2010","I'll put it very simply, I think this movie was really cool. Excellent story, visual effects, action, all of it combined masterfully to create a great film that delivers entertainment and style throughout, without sacrificing a good plot. It has all the right elements and the cool elements in a proper balance making it fun yet not dumb.I liked a lot Iron Man 1 and I think if you also did so, then you would most likely like this one too. I really like films of this genre like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Hellboy 2, Watchmen and I think both Iron Man films are up to the level.

"Iron Man 2","darkmax","4 May 2010","For those of you who said there is little or no story in this movie, just what were you watching? The couple making out in front of you, or were you busy attending to your SMS or email messages? Now I just got to know that Sam Rockwell was a contender for the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark in the first film, I am so glad he didn't get the part and Robert Downey Jr did.In the first movie we got to see a lot more of Iron Man, while Tony Stark stood quietly in the background. In the sequel it is Tony Stark that matters more than Iron Man. In fact Iron Man has become a mere tool for ego and fame and is beginning to become a liability to SI and tony. Unfortunately there isn't enough running time for the director to explore the deeper character of Tony Stark and his struggle with his alter ego and alcohol. Shame.Pepper Pott should have had more anger, anguish and frustration, but the character was not explored.I agree with some reviewers in saying that there is likely a spin-off in the Black Widow character. Although I must say, Scarlet Johannson's performance was a bit off. I always thought the character to be quite a bit colder, as in an ice queen.Is it me or is Samuel L. Jackson putting on tens of pounds?! I could hardly recognize him in the café scene with Robert Downey Jr!!! Shame that Sam Rockwell is still playing villain. He is quite a versatile actor who is constantly under-utilized and under appreciated.Notice how I am talking about characters and not story or the SFX? Well, for those of you watching this movie thinking there is a better story than the first, you do know that you are watching a sequel to a comic superhero screen adaptation. 30-40 years of history does not shrink well into a 2 hour movie... it won't even fit a 10 hour one.As for special effects, what else can you not expect to be thrown into a modern blockbuster like this? Heck, even the kitchen sink can be entirely CG! What's new since Jurassic Park? Overall, there is perhaps a re-watch value somewhere, but it is definitely worth the price of the ticket you pay the first time round.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","NanoFrog","10 May 2010","Not sure i understand why writers today, for Hollywood films, just cannot write (or perhaps get approval and money) for an actual good story? While the cast is immensely pleasing and the effects nearly perfect, there is just no story here. This inability of film-makers to actually produce these special effects films which also contain at least an interesting story is a great curiosity to me. If one were a student of Marvel comics, you might recall the many great stories that the writers made around their characters. There is a great emptiness, a gratuitous over- stated violence about this film that is sad, given the audience and potential for this film.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","amesmonde","3 May 2010","Tony Stark reveals his superhero alter ego identity and while resisting calls by the government to hand over the Iron Man technology he finds himself threatened by a new enemy. I'm happy to say there's not much to dislike about Actor/Director Jon Favreau's excellent follow up to 2008's blend of comic book action, humour and effects.Iron Man 2 picks up where the first one left off, as billionaire Tony Stark must contend with the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies played by the wonderful Sam Rockwell and the perfectly cast Mickey Rourke.Thankfully Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt and looks great as the Black Widow, although the costumes cuffs looked a little out of place. Don Cheadle unnecessarily replaces Terence Howard as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes but is just as good, phew!The leads; Gwyneth Paltrow surprisingly cast in this role returns and is the grounded back bone of the film. Robert Downey Jr. once again is fantastic as the witty extrovert Stark. There's lot of emotion as you see Stark's father and a glimpse of their relationship. Downey's acting captures Stark's battles with his mortality and his alter ego fittingly.The effects are well executed and don't detract from the action or story in anyway. Fans will enjoy nods and references including The Avengers, Captain America and Samuel L. Jackson's second Nick Fury cameo, to name a few. Again there's a great script and storyline that zips along at a nice pace backed by a fitting music score and rock tracks. Personally, I feel it's better than Iron Man due to it's sharper editing and sleeker look. Stick around until after the end credits as there is a nice teaser of another superhero. Like the Fantastic 4's films all in all Iron Man 2 is the perfect comic book flick that captures the spirit of Marvel, it's just a shame Sam Raimi's Spiderman didn't have the same perfect blend of drama, action and adventure that Iron Man has...","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","dee.reid","15 May 2010","One of the many great pleasures of watching 2008's ""Iron Man"" was that it allowed to some degree for star Robert Downey, Jr., playing billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who moonlighted and eventually revealed to the world his secret identity as the armored superhero Iron Man, to exorcise the many demons from his lonely, drug-fueled days in the annals of Hollywood Hell. Stark, of course, has in the past dealt with debilitating bouts of alcoholism, so this role would have allowed Robert Downey, Jr. to face any remaining demons from his past. It is this deep personal struggle that has made Tony Stark/Iron Man one of the more fascinatingly introspective characters in the Marvel Comics Universe of superheroes.But whatever meditations these movies could have had in dealing with the harrowing perils of drug addiction gets lost in the bang-bang pacing, action and special effects of the latest Hollywood superhero blockbuster to boast spectacular visuals and top-notch performances but lacking any real depth or content. Actor/director Jon Favreau is quickly becoming a favorite in Hollywood, especially with the way he's handling his work on the ""Iron Man"" movies, and he proves his mettle, regardless of the lack of thematic complexity or depth that they could have had, with this sequel ""Iron Man 2."" And while I would have personally much more enjoyed the subject of Stark's internal struggles with alcoholism rather than his external struggles with the U.S. government, I guess what we get here will have to do for now.While less skillful and entertaining than its 2008 predecessor, I personally feel that I somehow enjoyed this one a lot more, perhaps because it features a more-fleshed-out supporting role from Stark's best friend Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle, having fully replaced Terrence Howard from the previous film), who of course later dawns a powered armor suit of his own to become the awesomely bad-ass War Machine. And the movie has a killer soundtrack by those Aussie bad boys AC/DC.This time out, Stark has really let his arrogance get to his head, and this is something that Downey, Jr. really pushes past its limits to become cinematic gold. He has effectively saved the world from certain doom so many times in the past that he has also effectively ""privatized world peace,"" and the government wants a piece of his technology because he has so quickly and so suddenly made them look incompetent.All that's about to change when the villainous Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) shows up on Tony's home turf one day and challenges him to a duel. Vanko is especially miffed at Stark because he believes that Stark's father stole the technology that he developed with Vanko's father and had him deported back to Russia to cover his tracks. So Ivan, possessing blueprints for Stark's technology to exact his revenge, develops some nifty little weapons of his own to become the whip-wielding super-villain Whiplash.On the home front, meanwhile, Stark's ticker is deathly ill and feels that his time is running out, and he hands over control of Stark Industries to his would-be love interest Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). And just as he does this, another character is introduced, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannson), who also hides a few secrets of her own since she is also the lethal spy/secret agent Black Widow.A lot of stuff goes on in ""Iron Man 2"" and there's the main problem (other than that other issue I mentioned earlier about Stark's battles with alcoholism getting the shaft here): a lot goes on and the movie kind of feels crammed as a result. Rourke is a fascinating presence whenever he's on the screen, which unfortunately is not very much, but I enjoyed his scenes the most, especially since he comes under the yoke of Stark's rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). Johannson's Black Widow also gets shafted as well, since she doesn't really become a big player in all this superhero stuff until the film's action-packed, 20-minute climax. And at least Cheadle's War Machine is made useful in the film before (note that I said ""before"") he and Iron Man have to go to work as a team to defeat a newly powered-up Whiplash (which is a little anti-climatic and a bit short, to say the least).Am I nit-picking some things? Probably. But the reason we keep coming back is because of the action, special effects, and Robert Downey, Jr. as Marvel Comics' Man of Steel... Iron. He's utterly perfect for this role: he's arrogant, greedy, narcissistic, and drops more biting one-liners here than Arnold Schwarzenegger ever did in his prime (not knocking the great Schwarzenegger here, but you get my point). But he's a hero, and that all that matters in ""Iron Man 2.""9/10","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","socrates99","21 May 2010","You need very little persuasion to fall into this movie's utterly entertaining world. I really can't imagine anyone not liking it. Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Sam Rockwell in particular all put in near perfect, memorable performances. But it's the very well written story that carried the day, for me. It's not real deep but it's not mere window dressing either. What would Ironman do if requested to give his technology to the military? And how would he handle toe to toe competition? And there's more, but it's better you see it rather than hear about it.John Favreau is clearly gaining in skill and ambition as director while still being willing to feed our male fantasies. Scarlett is a great example as the lithesome Natasha Romanoff. No graphic novel could ever match her role for visual female sumptuousness and sheer beauty. You'll wish there was more of her though wisely Favreau leaves you slightly frustrated. All in all a fun movie way beyond my expectations. But I'm glad I'm not Favreau. What could he do to top these two movies?","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","xtian_durden","4 May 2010","It doubled its predecessor. Bigger and better, this sequel is getting close to somewhere. Mickey Rourke was perfect in his terrifying villain, Don Cheadle earned War Machine's suit, Scarlett Johansson looks so hot in her acrobatic scenes, and Jon Favreau (the director) enjoyed his part in the movie, he gave his character (Happy Hogan) a bigger role than his previous cameo in Iron Man. I watched the first installment and the sequel both in the theater, and I must admit that I enjoyed this one much more than the first. It fills every gap in the first movie, a more startling opponent matched by upgraded weapons, the action takes us to a new level. This one is thicker than the first.

"Iron Man 2","javaman-7","5 May 2010","Java Man Reviews ""Iron Man 2"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2010.OVERVIEW: While the identity of most super heroes remains shrouded in mystery, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) has been publicly revealed as the breast-plated bad-boy known as Iron Man. Unlike Batman or Spiderman, Stark has to deal with things like Senate hearings, jealous G-Men and rival CEOs. Everyone wants the Iron Man technology. Meanwhile, over in Russia, a metallic mastermind named Ivan (Rourke) is steeling himself to challenge Stark for world supremacy. Returning from the original Iron Man are Stark's trusted assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and army liaison ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Cheadle). New characters are Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) and Nick Fury (Jackson) both of whom add a big dose of scene-stealing appeal. REVIEW: 3 of 4 Java Mugs Sequels are inevitably compared to their originals and more often than not they don't measure up. Because of the cast, this one could have been an exception: Downey is still a marvel to watch and Paltrow may be even better in this version; Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard, is also fine. Rourke and Rockwell as villains and Jackson and Johansson as intriguing spy types are all fascinating; and Shandling as the chairman of a Senate investigating committee is hilarious. But the screenplay is very much by-the-numbers, and it just doesn't add up. The captivating characters and stimulating situations which distinguished the original have given way to long and loud action sequences. But if it's action you want, you've got it; these scenes are very well done and are accompanied by lots of heavy metal music (what else?). The cinematography is also noticeably sharp with a lots of excellent aerial views. Great location work in and around California, and in Monaco during the principality's Grand Prix, also adds to the film's visual vitality. I waited in a long line to see this movie, but it was worth it because of the enthusiastic audience that surrounded me. Come early to get a good seat--and stay late through the end credits for a big hint at what may be coming next from the franchise.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","andrewnmiller","23 February 2015","After watching the first Iron Man and enjoying it, I thought that the second would be mediocre at best. Well, I can honestly say that didn't happen because I found Iron Man 2 be just as fun and action-packed as the first one.The film starts off very nicely, with recordings from the end of the first film where Tony Stark tells the media that he is the man in the iron suit. The scene then cuts to Russia where we're introduced to our villain, Ivan Vanko watching his father dying. It appears that his father, Anton used to work with Tony's father, Howard, and somewhere down the road, Howard seized Anton's ideas and booted him to the curb and for this, Ivan swears revenge on Stark. Meanwhile, the palladium core of Tony's arc reactor that keeps him alive is slowly killing him and he can't find an alternate. He begins to become increasingly irresponsible and downhearted about his looming demise, and decides not to tell anyone about his ailment and appoints Pepper Pots as the CEO of Stark Industries and employs Natalie Rushman as his personal assistant. While racing in the Monaco Grand Prix, Tony is attacked by Vanko, but is able to fight him off. Now, Stark must get his life back together, build a new reactor and stop Vanko.While most sequels try to up the ante, Iron Man 2 comes across as a brisk and harmless film that meanders along at an attractive clip, with emotional discomfort a distant thought which is very refreshing. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the total opposite of some other comic book films. For example, it's definitely not darker than the first Iron Man and also gives itself artistic freedom to extend on the impossible. Common sense simply does not work here and Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux have a lot of freedom with the chines of reality. While the first Iron Man was an origins story, the sequel had no lack of possible roads to take, so it decided to go with the characterization road and instead of developing its universe, the movie merely takes it's cast of characters and tosses them into circumstances grimmer than before, upping the stakes but at the same time echoing the spirit of the first one. The characters are well written, each quick conversation decided with a mature bleakness that differentiates from the illegitimate situations that the film features and while the movie could be labeled as a comedy, but the humor flows so perfectly that you get the sense that it would be out of the question to write this film and not have these characters joke with one another. There are a number of themes in this movie, the most notable one being one's legacy, of what we pass on when we pass away; the impact on those who follow us and how the consequences of past actions can ricochet down the line long after someone passes on.The visual effects in this film are fantastic with lots of explosions, ear-jolting sound effects, stunning camera techniques and cinematography to keep the audience focused. As for the action, there's only a few scenes, but they all bring a lot to the movie by bringing the viewer a ton of excitement and delight, especially the finale, a 30 minute visual feast for the eyes and senses of Iron Man and War Machine battling Whiplash and his drones, which left me hungry for more. The soundtrack is darker than the first film and has some outstanding tracks along with a great soundtrack with songs by Daft Punk, Queen, and AC/DC.The acting is incredible just as it was in the first film: Gwyneth Paltrow once again proves herself as Pepper Potts, bringing a lot of sadness to the role, but is by no means a damsel in distress, not to mention she and Downey have wonderful chemistry, Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan and gets to have more fun in the movie rather than just staying behind the camera, Sam Jackson pops up again as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury sowing the seeds for later MCU films. Don Cheadle picks up right where Terrance Howard left off in the first Iron Man as Rhodey/ War Machine, stepping into the role with certainty and proves himself to be superior to Howard. Scarlett Johansson is awesome as Black Widow, proving she is more than capable of being in an action film and while she isn't on screen for much of the movie, her flight scene in the hall does leave an impact. The villains of the film as just as important as our heroes and they don't disappoint with Mickey Rourke adding a combination of a contrived show person, arrogant mastermind and an overpowering monster, while perfectly personifying Vanko's rude visage while Sam Rockwell is complete comic fodder as Tony's business rival, Justin Hammer. Rockwell kills it in this role and is a joy to watch, either when he's losing his temper with Vanko or awarding his own creations with childish enthusiasm. But the true heart and soul of Iron Man 2 comes from Robert Downey Jr. He is the mind, heart and spirit of the man in the iron suit which makes me think if the film was written especially for him. When it comes to Stark's vain personality and sarcasm, he also shines there too, providing us with a ton of great quips and laugh-out-lord moments and while Downey does portray a selfish, egotistical playboy; he is still a likable character. Much like the first one, RDJ is and will always be Iron Man.All and all, Iron Man 2 is a worthy successor to the first film, proving us with more of what we loved with more action, humor, a killer soundtrack, stellar performances and a great story. Definitely give this film a watch, you'll have a blast.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","TheUnknown837-1","13 May 2010","It was quite a challenge to top such an exhilarating, original (at least by today's storytelling standards) summer extravaganza like 2008's big hit ""Iron Man."" That film was well done on a technical level, but the reason why it is so good and why it is twice the movie that ""Transformers"" (2007) was because it used its special effects as a service to its story instead of simply relying on them to save the day. So it's a real challenge to not only build on that, but improve upon that. But by Jove, director Jon Favreau and his cast and crew have done that with flying colors with ""Iron Man 2"" which to my mind is not only better than the original, but the best film that I've seen so far this year.The movie picks up where the first one left with Robert Downey Jr.'s alcoholic, eccentric character of Tony Stark revealing his alter-ego identity as Iron Man. While he combats a power-greedy senator's strive to strip him of his technological triumph and to maintain a somewhat stable employer-employee (and sometimes romantic) relationship to his assistant Pepper Potts, again played with grace and conviction by Gwyneth Paltrow, a new villain with his own technological tools and dazzling wit (Mickey Rourke) arrives, seeking revenge not only on Stark as a person, but his legacy.It seems to be a trend these days for the second installment in superhero movie franchises to be better than the first. That was the case with Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" saga, with Christopher Nolan's marvelous reinvention of the Batman character, and now with Jon Favreau's Iron Man pictures. In my original review, I stated that I really enjoyed the first ""Iron Man"" picture but felt that its climax was a little lacking and that there were some weak zones in its plot. However, all of that is built up and enhanced with the sequel and if there is one word I can use to describe it, it is: exhilarating. Even as it builds up new story lines with new characters, some of which may be ostensibly unnecessary, it never bogs down.Like ""Spider-Man 2"", ""Iron Man 2"" brings up the plot element of the main character's alter-ego taking over his life to the point where his normal life starts to fall apart, causing him to shun his responsibilities and obligations. Although this is a sort of familiar story, the filmmakers do a great job at keeping things on the move. What's also great, and carrying down from the first picture is how it's not all grim and tough, but has effective moments of comedy such as a scene where Scarlett Johanssen reveals to a cocky boxing manager that she knows a little more about the sport than she led him to believe. And of course the highlights are conversations between Robert Downey, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow and these melodramatic moments are blended with the more traditional tones seamlessly so that it does not feel like the movie is phasing in and out of one personality, heck, like its central character.You want special effects? You got 'em. Just like in the first picture, ""Iron Man 2"" is packed with lots of explosives, bursts of action, ear-jarring sound effects, and marvelous camera tricks and cinematography to lock the audience's attention in place. But once again, these special effects, unlike the effects in ""Transformers"" and its sequel, are used as a service to the story and that is why they do not overstay their welcome. The movie saves its drawn-out climax to the end and this climax is twice as exciting as the somewhat shallow final battle of the first movie.Robert Downey Jr. is still most effective as the troubled character of Tony Stark. He's charming, witty, humorous, and believable not as a caricature, but as a human being. Gwyneth Paltrow is equally effective as Pepper Potts; Scarlett Johansson is both seductive and convincing as the new assistant who has her own way of backing herself up; Sam Rockwell does a fantastic job playing the techno-dweeb big on money but short on brawn; Mickey Rourke is sinister and cold-blooded as the villain; and Don Cheadle does a surprisingly good job taking over for Terence Howard as Tony Stark's military pal.I can't think of one person I know whom I won't recommend seeing ""Iron Man 2."" From start to finish, this is one exhilarating piece of film-making. It excels, I say, over its already exhilarating predecessor and many of its companion superhero sagas, and proves itself to be one truly enjoyable time at the movies.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Syrchek","15 May 2010","This is one of the very few blockbuster franchises that I have followed so far. I usually see them fast, or I don't see them at all. And following the Iron Man franchise has ""payed off"", so far. But this part is different and does feel different than the first, and for some reason it's not so easy to immediately answer why exactly.The first thing that came to mind is that despite the bigger budget of the second part, the ""level"" and the time of action is the same if not shorter than in ""Iron Man 1"". I never thought that I will ever caught myself thinking that there should be more action and less talking in a so-called ""summer film"".The real substitute for all the chasing, shooting and blowing up that is a bit missing in this film, is an array of new characters. The constant talking of everyone, especially Tony Stark of course, gives the film a dynamic pace and probably makes those 2 hours go by much quicker. But from my view, the most silent character of all, Vanko, was the most interesting one.What is also specific for the Iron Man franchise and many of this kind of big films of the new millennium, is the skillful adding of ""counter-culture"" elements in a very mainstream product. This part left me down here quite a bit. The first trailer for the film had me thinking and hoping that we'll see some kind of a critique of war-profiteering and that it will all lead us to a path of at least some moral dilemmas. But sadly, all of Vanko's motives for vengeance are reduced to some old family rivalry. I guess it is (still?) too much to ask for more from a king-size summer opening film like this.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Meven_Stoffat","5 May 2010","I will admit that I was a tad worried about Iron Man 2, because, well let's face it, the first movie was so fantastic that it was almost untouchable. I mean, with the first movie, you had the extraordinary talents of Downey, Howard, Paltrow, Bridges and plenty more anchoring what was an incredible must-see summer slam of a movie. However, seeing the trailers for the second movie made me think ""Uh oh, Spider Man 3 all over again."" Sequels, especially superhero ones, seem to think that since they bring tons of random crap and characters into the frame, that they are always better, and as excited as I was for this movie, I felt it was going to be another one of those movies. So upon going into the theater, I kept those worries in mind.Well, I can now officially say that those worries didn't prevent me from loving the movie.Remember when Michael Bay tried to accomplish something epic with Transformers 2 with all these new characters and stuff? Well, Jon Faverau has managed to accomplish what Michael Bay never did- make a near-perfect sequel that manages to be just as great as the first. Now like the first, there's not a ton of action, but those scenes where action is absent, Faverau manages to make the most out of them. Complete with great action, laughs and characters, Iron Man 2 is the first big summer movie, and a must see on the big screen for sure, especially if you see it in digital! Iron Man 2 picks up half a year from when the first movie left off. The Stark Expo has just begun in Flushing, New York, and is to last all year. Tony, in a televised hearing, privatizes world peace. Life seems to be great, except for the fact that the reactor keeping him alive is killing him. This doesn't stop him from being Iron Man though- he continues to go on as Iron Man for the moment. He even considers replacing Pepper Potts with Natalie Rushman, appointing Potts a CEO to Stark Industries. However, in Russia, Ivan Vanko, the son of physicist Anton Vanko, having just lost his father and jealous of Stark's success, creates his own arc reactor, and becomes Whiplash, a badass villain with two electrified whips that can split anything in half with enough force.His first appearance is at a race in Monaco, and after a brief (and failed) attempt to kill Tony, he meets up with Justin Hammer, Stark's rival, and they both collaborate to build a new technology that will hopefully overthrow Tony. However, with a stint at Tony's house appointing James Rhodes as War Machine, and several other plots, Tony Stark, suffering through personal problems, doesn't know if he really can be Iron Man and resolve all this.Now the plot may not sound that great, but when you see it in the movie, you will be impressed with how complex it is. To not spoil too much, I left some stuff out, because the movie is that great. Aside from the plot, everything else is great. The acting here is fantastic! Robert Downey Jr. has his usual charm here, playing the lovable dick-head that is Tony Stark. Replacing Terrence Howard is Don Cheadle, and he does it well! I can't believe I am saying this but I actually preferred him to Howard. Howard was great but wooden in places, whereas Cheadle was great the whole way. And Scarlett Johannson whoa. When is she NEVER eye candy? As for her performance- this movie proves she is not just another pretty face. Her fight scene is just mind blowingly amazing! Mickey Rourke gives a a fantastic performance as well, and manages to shine as the villain, Of course, halfway through, the movie takes a break from the action and focuses on some character development- I was worried about it at first hearing but as I was watching the movie, I realized that sometimes, in superhero movies, character development does more than whiz-bang action. Don't worry guys, the scenes where action is absent are just as great as the scenes with action. But the action scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!! People are exaggerating the lack of action- the last 20 minutes alone has more action than the first, and is certainly more thrilling than the first too. The climax certainly is a thrill, and I gotta say I had a blast seeing it on the big screen.So in short, Iron Man 2 is a success. I had tons of fun seeing it on the big screen. A great sequel and a great standalone movie, Iron Man 2 is a sequel that truly kicks ass. Whatever worries you may have, I recommend you cast them aside, because you're in for a 2 hour fun ride. So if you wanna see a sequel that truly kicks ass, this movie is it!","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","Marvelouis","2 May 2010","It's clear that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play the part of Tony Stark. As he did the first time around, he portrays the perfect combination of suave and selfishness, energy and ungoverned gluttony, troubled spirit and a soul seeking redemption and responsibility. It's clear that Downey has brought everything to the part. This movie is about Stark's spiritual growth. He's certainly bitten off more than he can chew mostly because of his proclamation to end the last film. He's way overextended himself and now everything is crashing down around him. He really has to dig down deep and that's the mark of a true hero. How can the awards people keep overlooking this part? RDJ as Tony Stark is now the stuff of legend. Think Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal. Pacino as Michael Corleone. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry. John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone.Tony Stark isn't a mutant or a ninja or nothing silly has happened to him. Stark isn't a cheesy, tights wearing superhero. It's great that he can't jump into a phone booth and be on his cheesy way. He's a flawed man but he's anything but ordinary. This sequel perfectly picks up where the first film left off. Every step of the way is believable and incredibly interesting. All of the amazing effects are grounded in realism. I know they built the Iron Man armor and War Machine armor in real life and mixed it flawlessly with CG. It wasn't all a CG mishmash and all of it plays out in stunning fashion. There was a realism to everything. Using practical effects and a practical suit of armor paid off big-time. I seriously enjoyed not being able to tell the difference between a CG shot and a practical shot. The suits of armor develop a personality of their own. They communicate and allows us to see certain POV. Even the drones were amazing. There are so many great details that I truly believe this movie will be king of the multiple viewings. I can't see myself ever tiring of the action or performances.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","oldman007","30 April 2010","This movie will definitely be one of the best movies (if not the best) I see in 2010. Robert Downey JR returns to do Tony Stark, better and funnier than ever! Tony Stark is enjoying life as himself and as being the famous Iron Man. A huge threat comes to his attention. A man with whips is trying to kill him! With the help of Don Cheadle as War Machine, the two of them try to bring a man who calls himself Whip Lash to justice! Mickey Rourke plays the part very well! It just goes to show you've never too old to be a badass villain! Scarlet Johanson plays a very hot, but very suspicious lady! The rest of the cast are good as well.My only complaint is the middle half of the movie goes abit too slow and drags on abit. I wont reveal why, but you will see what I mean when you watch it. And Iron Man does reveal how he goes to the bathroom while wearing the Iron Man suit! I'd give this movie a 9/10.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","brettchatz-1","7 May 2010","The inimitable Iron Man returns in an exciting sequel and fans are going to roar with excitement There's a whole lot more to Iron Man 2 than meets the eye. Purists of the Iron Man Marvel Comics genre will no doubt find many elements of the film to their liking. Such was the mastery of combining humour, action and digital effects that the film was an unqualified success.Tony Stark returns to the fold in his typical narcissistic style. In fact if egos the size of his were commonplace, the world would need several iron men. Robert Downey Jr reprises the role that he so perfectly portrayed since the first installment of the multimillion dollar series. He's witty, intelligent and noticeably a few years older! But weapons expert Tony Stark is also Iron Man and this alter-ego has a life-force all his own.The presence of Iron Man in the early parts of the stellar film is rather limited, but he soon rocks back into action and brings a roar of approval from the audience. There are scenes where the anticipation of Iron Man's arrival are like literal live-wires and it's great to see him restoring order.Mickey Rourke expertly portrays Ivan - a physicist with a bent for Stark's destruction. He's heavily muscled, wicked beyond compare and his plan to destroy Iron Man is not without its merits. But can he team up with Hammer Industries to create an army of cyborgs to destroy the Iron Man? The film has many side plots such as the budding romance between Stark and his beautiful CEO - Pepper (Paltrow). Moviegoers will love Don Cheadle's side-kick role as an apt Iron Man tag-team star. And a cameo by several heavyweight Hollywood A-listers will do more than tickle a few taste buds.The film has been accused of being unoriginal and while there are obvious overlaps with the first installment, the action is all-new and the humour is incisive. It's witty from beginning to end and it gives new meaning to the words 'tin grin.' The verdict: Do not miss the awesome action-packed superhero flick - Iron Man 2.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","Norway1","30 April 2010","I'm really torn between a rating of 7 and 8 and should probably see it again before a final verdict. But my initial feeling is this one had too much talk and too little heart.While there certainly was more action, the action scenes - especially the last - did not feel threatening at all. The one possible exception to this is the first battle between Iron Man and Whiplash - the one on the race track from the trailer.The main problem is probably too much dialog, possibly too much happening, and too little heart. Too few quiet moments. I'm not sure.My guess is the film makers heard that people loved the humor from the first (which was mostly ad-libbed from the actors) but missed more action. So they apparently gave the whole cast (of GREAT actors all around!) free reign to talk up as much as they want in each and every scene. And they added action sequence after action sequence to make up for the mere two major sequences from Iron Man 1.The end result was slightly underwhelming, yet almost satisfying.","1/10"
"Iron Man 2","vip_ebriega","9 May 2010","Big expectations from the original are hard to live up to, which just seems unfair to this reasonably enjoyable and exciting sequel. Going over that age-old Hollywood mantra that ""bigger is better"", this sequel throws in bigger set-pieces, better special effects and a superb cast. But unlike most sequels to successful hits, IRON MAN 2 is not only big in terms of special effects and action set-pieces, it also has stronger characters (perhaps the only real problem with that is that they're too many of them) and an even stronger plot.As with the other people who enjoyed the first IRON MAN movie, my hopes were high for the sequel. As in other superb comic-book movie sequels like SPIDER-MAN 2 and THE DARK KNIGHT, the storyline frees itself from the exposition settled in the first movie and are now able to take the story into a different direction for the sequel. Following the end of the first movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has already admitted his identity as Iron Man and, as he puts it, ""successfully privatized world peace"". Arrogant as he is, he gets the job done, but saving the world is only half the battle. Stark also has a demanding Senator Stern (Gary Shandling) on his back who wants his Iron Man technology surrendered to the military, a similarly egotistic rival (Sam Rockwell) who wants Stark and his crowning achievement be reduced to yesterday's news, and of course there's vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) bent on killing Stark to avenge his father. Only to make matters worse, the arc reactor that's keeping Stark alive is slowly poisoning his blood, and would kill him if he doesn't find a substitute to the reactor's Palladium content.There are enough characters here that could have made this as an early reunion for The Avengers, with a powerhouse of a cast to boot. In addition to the return of Downey's egotistic Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow's delightful portrayal as long-suffering assistant-turned-CEO Pepper Potts, there's also Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johnasson in a black leather suit and sporting red hair! 'Nuff said), Samuel L. Jackson's return as Nick Fury (after a very brief cameo in the first), Don Cheadle replacing Terence Howard as Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (who finally gets his ""next time"" opportunity as he dons the suit as the battle-ready War Machine), and even Favreau's Happy Hogan (nothing more than an extended cameo in the first film) gets more screen time. On the bag guy side is Rourke's disgruntled Vanko, Rockwell playing another character we would love to hate, and Shandling's hilarious portrayal of a greedy politician. Too many of these characters could have repeated the misstep that SPIDER-MAN 3 had done; too many characters with too many subplots that ruin the flow of the story. But director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux avoid this pitfall by just giving our characters enough screen time that they deserve and only throwing in subplots that actually move the story along.IRON MAN 2 is what a summer blockbuster sequel should be; it throws in everything we expect from its superb predecessor and giving is a little more without being something akin to an overstuffed, overcooked turkey. The action sequences are great in the first movie, and they're even bigger here. It even has a better, more thrilling climax than the one in he first, and more interesting and even outrageous villains than in the original. As usual, Downey Jr. is still one of the chief delights with his portrayal of a different kind of comic-book hero. Throw in a cast that looks absolutely perfect and every thrilling action set-piece in place and you have a sequel that's actually worth the wait.Rating: **** out of 5.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","TheLittleSongbird","12 August 2014","The first Iron Man was a great film, smart, exciting and classy with a powerhouse performance from Robert Downey Jnr. Iron Man 2 is not as good and is lacking in places, being not as classy, irreverent or exciting though it is not devoid of those qualities. The characters are not as interesting or as well-realised, Vanko is a little one-dimensional for a villain, Pepper's character is so reduced that what made her so endearing in the first is lost here and Natasha/Natalie's motivations are not as clear as they could have been. The story at times is over-familiar and cluttered with parts of the film that would have benefited from not trying to do too much and it could have had a tighter paced beginning. The script is certainly not bad with some amusing moments and one that make you think, but that of the first film has smarter humour and more intelligently structured, the film could have been longer perhaps with some subplots being explored more, the characters better developed and a little less time on some scenes, Gwyneth Paltrow was fun in the first but because of how Pepper was written she isn't anywhere near as much here and Jon Favreau's performance is rather annoying and unnecessary. Like the first film though the film looks great, with very stylish cinematography and editing, vivid location work and special effects that show a lot of time and effort and don't feel like over-load. The gadgets are also great fun and the Iron Man suit is still awesome. The music works very well, not quite as good as that of the first but it adds to the action without over-powering or bogging the pace down. The story while having a little too much going on and being over-familiar still does compel, is not too convoluted and it flows smoothly pacing-wise, and has a couple of note-worthy set pieces. There isn't a lot of action but what there is has thrills and fun aplenty, Vanko's entrance at the Grand Prix race is very dramatic and what follows is equally as thrilling and the climax while not as long as it could have been still outdoes that of the first. Favreau's direction still continues to be clever, with a mix of nostalgia for comic book fans and themes and such that would be currant by today's standard. The acting is fine, excepting Paltrow and Favreau, and there is great chemistry between them all. Robert Downey Jnr's performance is not quite a power-house but he still has the zany comic timing and the ability to give off the emotional depth needed for one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters. Mickey Rourke is menacing and a lot of fun as Vanko, Scarlett Johansson shows how well she can play fearless and Sam Rockwell plays a real weasel and does so to hilarious and sleazy perfection. Don Cheadle also performs with authority. In conclusion, not as good as the wonderful first film but is still a thoroughly decent sequel that gets most things right. 7/10 Bethany Cox","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","samratrc1417","29 April 2010","I was bored today and wanted to catch a movie. It was quite a shock when i found out Ironman II was playing. I was under the impression it was going to release on the 7th of May. Great!!I queued up and saw it, blessing my lucky stars!Wow!It's amazing to see the number of actors joining the directors club. We knew Jon Favreau was good when we saw 'Elf'. He just keeps on getting better. This is phenomenal. I am afraid this movie is not for 'artsy' type. Girls and refined folks! Advice for y'all! Keep away. This ain't your scene! This is a plain and simple hardcore action movie with a great story and even greater action. Mind blowing action! Both the movies have great scripts. Favreau is lucky with that one. And awesome actors playing them. I am not gonna give away the story. I recommend you see for yourself. If ever there was a 'Phoenix' in Hollywood, its Robert Downey Jr. A decade ago he was convicted and imprisoned. The only thing going for him was Ally Macbeal. Hollywood had written him off. Now he's headlining two big franchises. Tony Stark and Sherlock Holmes. Speaks volumes about his quality. He rose from his ashes. The other 'Phoenix' being Micky Rourke. He's just awesome as 'Whiplash'. I think i will add some 'Vankoism' in my vocabulary when i criticize any software...'Thees sooftwer ees sheeet' in a Russian accent.I know i didn't give much of a review because i don't want to prejudice any potential viewer. All i am going to say is 'You will not be disappointed'. I leave you with that note and let you judge for yourself....","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","jan_kalina","17 November 2010","And indeed it is. The first Iron Man came like lighting from a clear blue sky, a movie that started Robert Downey Jr's career, movie loved by audience and critics. Now there is a sequel and people are asking if it's worth it. And I say Hell Yeah.Now when the whole world knows who Iron Man is, Tony is having a hard time staying alive. There are two men coming after him, a Russian Ivan Vanko who has an unfinished business with Tony. He claims that he stole the idea for the arc reactor from his father (which of course isn't entirely true, he is a Russian, you can't believe those.) The second guy after him is actually a competitor in business, Justin Hammer, who, for years is trying to build a suit like Iron Man's but with horrible results. Now with the government wanting Tony's Iron Man suit and Stark Industries closed for business, he has a chance to become the leading weapons industry. The acting and the cast here are truly remarkable. Robert Downey Jr. is, well he is Robert Downey Jr. He is perfect as usual, you can't miss with him being cast in your movie. Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job being the love interest. Mickey Rourke doesn't have much time on screen but when he is you can see he enjoys the role and still tries to establish the character even with such limited screen time. Sam Rockwell is the comical villain and he is great at it. Samuel L. Jackson is a synonym of the word cool and he proves it once again as Nick Fury. He briefly appears but when he does he's got one of the best lines in the movie such as ""Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut."" or "" I am very real. I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet"". The weakest link in the chain is Don Cheadle. He horribly doesn't fit as James Rhodes. He is uninteresting, and he acts too serious for this role. This is supposed to be entertaining, fun movie. And when he has no idea what to do, he copies Terrence Howard's take on this character. His character changed from the best friend ever to the worst friend. He became arrogant too. He actually thinks he is better than Iron Man!! But that of course isn't true. As always there is a great little cameo by Stan Lee. I can't forget all the rush on the internet Olivia Munn being a superhero and then she had just a tiny cameo as a news reporter. I was chuckling in the theater and no one had idea why.Casting Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was the smartest idea anyone ever had. She is the sexiest woman on Earth and seeing her in a tight leather suit is worth all the money on Earth. Her only fight scene in the hallway with like a dozen guards is amazing. It is one of the best choreographed fights of this year. It is just purely awesome, sexy, full of adrenaline and even funny.I just feel like all those composers started to try again after last year's (almost) fiasco. OK, there were few exceptions, the Star Trek soundtrack, Up soundtrack and the Sherlock Holmes soundtrack. In this year there is more than just three great soundtracks and Iron Man 2 is one of them. The score is darker and more bad-ass. Three tracks that really stand out: the first track (Ivan's Metamorphosis), Monaco Drive with this heavy James Bond feel and the track titled Black Widow Kicks Ass. Soundtrack as such features songs from AC/DC, Queen and even Daft Punk.There are more action scenes in this one than in the first movie. The action scenes are much better, they are fast paced, bad ass, simply better. There is even one car chase scene.In summary, if you liked the first then I guarantee you that you will enjoy this one too, it's a must-see for any fan of Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man or a comic-books. (There are tons of comic-book references including the Avengers, Hulk and it's just great fun looking for them.) This is a great, entertaining summer movie so go and watch it.Definitely wait until the end of the credits there is a great extra scene and you find out what agent Coulson was doing in New Mexico.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","jordancelticsfan","9 May 2010","I went to go see this with a friend on Saturday night. Now, I heard the film from others that this a step or two below the original, but I went in with an open mind. By the time the movie was over, I was pleased. But then, after thinking about it more, this is a disappointment. The film is drastically different in pace. Honestly, it gets a bit of a bore for awhile, which never happened in the original. Sometimes, its just hard to take this film seriously as a superhero film. In my opinion, the overwhelming number of laughs and silliness in this film makes it hard to take seriously. There is a large list of new things in this sequel. First, we learn much more about Tony Stark's father than we ever did in the original. Its quite interesting. Jon Favreau has a much, much bigger role in this film than the original, and I absolutely loved his role in the film. We learn his character has a personality. The talented Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey,and I actually liked him better in the role. They both seem so different in the role. There's Scarlette Johansson as Black Widow. I was honestly disappointed with her role in the film. It was too small, I thought. Mickey Rourke is raw and sinister as Whiplash, the main villain, and its a perfect fit. He does an absolutely perfect Russian accent. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is a good fit for the most part, although it was hard for me to take his character seriously after awhile as a villain. Sometimes, it seems like all his character does is be funny. Samuel L. Jackson has a much bigger role in this film as Nick Fury (he had a credit ending scene in the original). In a way it succeeds over the original, but for the most part it doesn't. It's missing some of the excitement and originality that made the original a truly great achievement in film. This is quite a bit different from the first, and you may not like how different it is. I certainly didn't. Many new actors, and a whole different type of ballgame. There's a bit, I think, too much silliness in this film. But still, it'll do. Go see this. Its not as fun as the first, but its not as disappointing as Spider Man 3 was. And do be sure to stay after the credits if you're a fan of Marvel Comics. Make sure you notice Stan Lee's cameo in this as well. Its rather brilliant. Overall, good film.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","bob the moo","18 September 2010","Although it was of course a summer blockbuster with all the flaws that came with it, I did really enjoy the first Iron Man film for what it did well. It was breezy, light and fun and it made it an easy film to like. I was hoping for more of the same from Iron Man 2 then and it is a little disappointing to find that it cannot quite replicate the same effect. Normally I would not be overly bothered by plotting in a summer action movie but for me this is sort of the problem with IM2. It is not that the plot is bad or complicated, it is just that it seems to lack a flow to it, meaning that it stutters along quite badly, robbing it of the light touch and sense of fun that the first film relied on.We have a Russian scientist out for revenge on the Stark corporation, Stark struggling with blood poisoning from his power source, Pepper Potts taking control of the company, Justin Hammer competing for military contracts, Stark refusing to share his technology with the US military (much to the chagrin of Rhodes) and Nick Fury continuing to try and recruit Stark to his Avengers initiative. In fairness the film is not as ""busy"" as it could have been with all these characters and aspects bumping around, but it does give it a rather messy feel and the film never feels comfortable until the final action sequence around the Expo. At this point there are goodies and baddies and everyone is pulling together in the same direction and it means nothing distracts and nothing breaks up the motion in the way that happens through most of the film.This is not the same as saying the film is bad, just that it doesn't quite have that fresh feel of the first film. Stark's excesses are overplayed to the point where he is a bit hard to like. The first film balanced this well (thanks to a great turn from Downey Jr) with his wit and character taking the load, but here the first part of the film gets a bit tiresome as Stark is in one glamorous location after another without much for the viewer to ""like"" about him. This turns around gradually but again never to the point of being as good as the first film. Downey Jr is still good though and he uses his laid-back charm to good effect when he gets the chance – it is not his fault that this film is ""busier"" than the first in terms of characters, so he has less time to spread out as he once did. Cheadle is OK but I would have preferred Howard in this role; the former just seems too hard and one-note here. Paltrow is amusing in her minor role while Johansson plays to her strengths by being firey in her hair and eyes while wearing a cat suit – nothing to say on her performance as an actress but she seems happy being a sexualised action figureen so who am I to question? Rockwell is great fun though. He plays well against Downey and he brings good humour to his parts. Rourke is a nonsense but an enjoyable one, he has a good presence and his character is at least interesting, which goes some way to making up for his rather silly costume. Favreau's appearance in front of costume doesn't do much as his comedy moments aren't that funny, while Jackson is determined to keep showing up in things being ""Samuel MF'ing Jackson"" over and over again. Shandling and Slattery are nice bits of casting.It isn't an actors' film though and it is mostly about the effects. The main CGI moments are great – free flowing, well delivered, quite exciting and technically impressive. Ironically some of the ""backdrop"" effects (like where the cast are clearly getting out of a car somewhere in the world other than where they appear to be) are pretty poor – not quite 1950's back projection but still they don't look real, although it is just a minor quibble.Overall Iron Man 2 is a reasonably enjoyable summer blockbuster. It has stars, it has noise, it has cheeky humour and all your money is up there on the screen to be enjoyed. Unfortunately for the franchise it has too much clutter in it that breaks up the flow of the film and makes it too heavy to feel as fresh and fun as the first Iron Man film. It will still please the target audience and it will work as a Friday night DVD but the studio's efforts to pull the Avengers together has actually hurt this specific film, making it less enjoyable than the first film by virtue of losing sight of what worked there by piling too much on top of it.","1/10"
"Iron Man 2","Etoopia","28 April 2017","With Marvel now having 15 movies out right now, there is a lot of people on the internet always criticizing Iron Man 2 on websites & YouTube. Don't listen to them. They are wrong.You have to realize the time period when this came out. Iron Man was such a monster success and as us comic book fans, we finally got War Machine in a film. Not only that, but they incorporated Tony Stark's alcoholism into the story line which was fantastic. Iron Man 2 was THE COMIC BOOK movie at that point. I remember everyone talking about it in 2010 and loving it. It did extremely well in box office. Mickey Rourke was fresh off of his Oscar nomination from The Wrestler. Sam Rockwell just did Moon. Don Cheadle was a very acceptable replacement for War Machine.The review of this film is that this is a great comic book film. People were still in awe over The Dark Knight just two years ago, and this was more light hearted and fun. Dark Knight was depressing and dark. This was upbeat and entertaining. Mikey Rourke as Whiplash was fantastic. And his character interacting with Sam Rockwell was brilliant. They are two of my favorite actors so I'm a bit biased. Don Cheadle was actually better than Terrence Howard. And of course Robert Downey Jr and Paltrow were amazing as usual. The film's story was great. Whiplash had Tony's technology and this caused the Government to find the excuse to shut down Tony. Meanwhile, besides external forces trying to shut down Tony, he is battling alcoholism and his own struggle with the metal possibly killing him. Besides the inner demons and Govt, but Whiplash is out for revenge toward Tony. He is the Russian counterpart to Tony, brilliant, but different version of Tony Stark. Tony's rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is competing with Tony in making the most advanced weapons.The movie has Tony against the ropes. Alcoholism, Whiplash against him, Govt against him, Justin Hammer trying to take him over, his physical problems with the reactor killing him, and his affection for Pepper Potts that can not bloom due to personal issues. So much going against Tony. This inner struggle and external struggle leads to one of the best Marvel movies.The film introduces us to a deeper perspective of SHIELD led by Nick Fury who has his first decent part in a Marvel film rather than a cameo. Also, the introduction of Black Widow who goes onto to play a huge role in the MCU. Agent Coulson gets a bigger part. And there is a few tie ins to the future Marvel movies such as Capt America, Thor and Avengers (critics bashed these subplots, but ITS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE that is staying true to the source material, I enjoyed it!) Critics also said the movie didn't have enough action, but this is another part I completely disagree. The action was just enough. The race track scene was one of the most memorable action scenes in all of MCU. Iron Man 2 wasn't support to be a Transformers movie or a dumb Zack Snyder DC film, its about the character of Tony Stark and his struggles. And this film nailed it.So why all the hate ? Because people tend to have short term memory. People are so spoiled with the Avengers movies, Guardians, so many sequels for the solo heroes, more solo origin stories - that Iron Man 2 got left behind in many people's heads. They don't remember how awesome it actually was to see War Machine for the first time. They don't remember how cool it was to see Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell as villains. To sum it up - people have short term memory and are spoiled. The idiots over at Collider are in their 40's and can't even remember anything beyond 2 years ago.In the end, Iron Man 2 is a fun entertaining film. Perhaps I'm biased because I had such a great time in 2010 seeing this film in theaters and getting really big into the Iron Man franchise (I'm a Batman & Spider-Man fan). But this movie just worked so well for me. I smiled the entire time watching it.Now Iron Man 3 ? That is a terrible film. I get offended when people put IM 2 and IM 3 in the same category as 'bad ones'. Iron Man 2 is NOT a bad film, its a GREAT film and one of my favorites in the MCU.10/10","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","ddin0","29 April 2010","First of all, if you expect to see lots of action in this movie - you will be disappointed! Basically, all the action you will see in this movie is what you saw in trailer. I know people have different tastes. I prefer action over drama and comedy, some people prefer different. So just so you know, this is written from action lovers point of view. First Iron Man had lots of action and was pumped with adrenaline, that is the biggest reason I liked it. This part just doesn't cut it for me. Here are few things I disliked a lot about this movie: there are a lot of random things in this movie, an example: while there is formula race about to begin, Tony decides to jump in one and race. I don't know if i missed some important part in this movie but I was like ""What the hell??? That makes no sense how the hell did they let him???"" or Tonies birthday party, man that was some random stuff right there. there is this agent played by Scarlett Johansson. To describe her shortly: she is James Bond 2. She can do anything: beat 20 guards? you bet, hack system made by a guy who hacked into important military system in 10sec? no problem. Just an examples, you will see through movie, don't want to spoil it for you. I expected 20-30min intro and then some epic action with great special effects, but I had to wait an hour and a half for that and it wasn't even epic! OK, movie is coming to an end, time for epic battle! Just kidding, fight is over before you say ""cookie"" stupidity of some scenes concerning highly sophisticated technology and system (also jail) security, an example: guy breaks through pentagon-like security system in 10sec, there are more things I'd like to add but I don't want to spoil it much for you as I mentioned. this movie is... boring. Talking, talking, talking, more talking, the worst part is - this talking isn't even interesting! After 30min of talking all I heard was bla, bla, bla... If at least it was something worth listening to, but only parts worth listening to were where Tony makes a good joke. Now, why did I give it a ""high"" 5/10 if it was disappointing (overall)? 1. Great special effects 2. This movie made me laugh A LOT3.Scarlett Johansson looks better then Megan Fox in Transformers.This movie should be tagged as (in this order) Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Sci-Fi and Action as last if you ask me. I don't think I wasted 2h on watching this, but I expected more, much more...","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","morgankingsley-11935","2 August 2023","I think this movie has two really great book ends. The start and the end both contain a lot of character ramifications, and a pretty good action scene respectively. But the middle part just is really hard to sit through, and takes it's sweet time making their point, for no real reason. This was the biggest ""pure set up"" MCU by far, since it was setting up for the avengers initiative, and the film really bogs down when it deals with that. Which is a shame because I really enjoy the parts about Tony learning that his father really did respect Tony, and the fact that Tony basically decided he wanted to carry his fathers legacy on. Plus the idea of him dealing with his mortality was a very good twist. But overall, the party scene and the set up just bogs the film down a notch. If it weren't for the second act I would give it a 7 or 8, but still a 6 isn't the worst rating ever just not the best.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","ocacia","1 May 2010","This film is a disgrace to it's predecessor- Fact. The word redundant scenes takes on new meaning. If you were teaching a class in redundant scenes (i.e. scenes that tell you nothing, contribute nothing to the story or the plot, but just help to get the film to its status of two hours of a waste of people's time).How many scenes have no direction and could be dropped in anyplace, or to any film. What about the silly dialog? The emergence of characters based solely on their personalities, Jackson for example. You have quality actors in this film looking like very bad actors. The roles given to them and the motives of the characters are paper thin. The only person that looked mean and meant it was Rouke. How many times have we seen the Sam Jackson character. I swore he looked like Shaft returned. Anyone giving this film a rating higher than 4 has no idea about quality. It sounds bold but it is how serious I feel about this zero (if i could) rating. Last film I saw was Titans, and that was at least marginally engaging with a obvious plot, but it followed a plot - at least. Was it asking too much to have a believable story from start to end?Another film which pulls steals peoples money, and the Hollywood industry is so poor these days that people are forced to watch nonsense like this and then say it was ""fun"".","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","XweAponX","26 September 2010","A couple of things we knew we were going to see - hinted at in the 1st Film - Rhodey as War Machine, the Suitcase-Suit, the dying Stark who has to drink 80 glasses of Green Machine a day, Pepper Potts as the head of Stark Industries - S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury and The Avengers - Black Widow! We get to see all of it in some form or other in this excellent Sequel. Adding to my belief that Robert Downey Jr was practically born to play Tony Stark, he builds on the first performance and reveals even more about who Iron Man is.Nothing really can be said about this that otherwise cannot be seen by simply watching the film. In Blu-Ray if Possible, on DVD if not... Looks good both ways.My only beef is that Terence Howard did not reprise the role of Rhodey/War Machine - But the addition of Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Mickey Rourke as Vanko, and Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury - Ease my initial disappointment at seeing Don Cheadle take up the mantle of War Machine - But the fact that Cheadle plays it JUST like Howard did - Even the Mannerisms, so it really IS the same Character, Cheadle does the best he can, not being Physically matched to Howard but personality-wise captured it. Also, the repeat performance of Leslie Bibb as the Vanity Fair Reporter Christine Everhart was well used- Even hinting that she was a fair Reporter, so maybe if there are any more of these, we'll get to see her come back, probably one of my favourite characters from this franchise. Finally, director Jon Favreau gets to be Happy Hogan a Lot MORE in this film much to my relief (Why recreate a great Iron Man character and only show them twice? Much better to have them in the film as much as the story can benefit by it?) The choice of Justin Theroux/Screenwriter made this a much darker story than the initial Iron Man story - As Tony builds Iron Man in the first film, this film mirrors that by having Vanko building his Arc-Reactor weApon. I thought they were bringing In Omega Red (X-Men Villain) into the story with the addition of Vanko, but apparently this is a combination of a couple of Iron Man Villains.This film is just another link in the upcoming promise of an Avengers film, and Marvel is gathering all of its forces for this effort. One thing we do know is that Iron Man WILL be a major part of The Avengers - And I ain't talking about Emma Peel!","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","colm-hearne365","23 April 2013","Granted this movie has some flaws (but what movie doesn't?) and not as thrilling as the first Iron Man movie but it's still very enjoyable and has some very good points. Pretty much all the actors do very well and are well-cast. Like we're introduced to new characters like Justin Hammer, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. We see more of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. We see Rhodey (now portrayed by Don Cheadle) become War Machine and battles along with Iron Man at the end. When I saw Cheadle as Rhodey, at first I didn't like how they changed the actor, but surprisingly he fit the role better than Terrence Howard. Robert Downey Jr. of course is spot on with his performance as Tony Stark being both arrogant and full of himself but also likable and charismatic at the same time. However, Gwyneth Paltrow was good as Pepper Potts and I liked how they showed more romance between her and Tony Stark but her nagging got kind of annoying. There's also a lot more lovely ladies in this one than the first one like Scarlett Johansson and the Ironettes. The action sequences and visual effects are very impressive too. However, the plot seems to be pretty slow in the middle but it gets better in the end.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","PWNYCNY","11 May 2010","This is one of the best science fiction movies Hollywood has made in many years. The middle of the movie drags a little, but it finishes strong. Robert Downey is great but the real star is Scarlet Johansson. She is beautiful; she is fantastic; she is wonderful. Her fight scenes are incredible; her overall performance is magnificent. Also she definitely has a flair for comedy. In short, Ms. Johansson is a great performer and proves it in this movie. Ten stars for Scarlet Johansson. Mickey Rourke is also excellent as the bad guy. The cgi's add to the story. This movie is actually better than the original. The Tony Stark character is further developed and the audience learns Pepper Potts' first name. This movie is a welcome addition to the science fiction genre. The movie tells a story; has interesting characters; and except for the middle part, the story moves along quickly and ends with the audience having been entertained.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","jasonpachar","25 June 2014","The old saying goes that when people retire, they don't come back head strong. I disapprove very strongly whoever said that. When Iron Man come on the scene in 2008 as a remake of the original comic book, I said it wouldn't last. I was completely, out-of-my-freaking-mind, this movie rocked. I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","jon.h.ochiai","17 May 2010","In the noisy gaudy opening of ""Iron Man 2"" billionaire bad boy Tony Stark arrives at his Stark Expo in the Iron Man suit. Once removed from his body armor, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony admits, ""It's all about legacy."" Amidst the fun, high energy and stupid plot line, legacy does resonate as a poignant theme. I agree with A.O. Scott, that casting overcomes a lot in ""Iron Man 2""—I think I liked the movie more than he did. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. And Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko provides what every hero story requires: a formidable villain. Director Jon Favreau is smart in never taking the movie too seriously, letting his actors morph and evolve. Favreau provides some spectacular action and visuals. The Monte Carlo Grand Prix where Vanko attacks Stark is stunning and heroic high drama.Downey is amazing in carrying off such a wide-band character in Tony. His Tony even cops to being a text book narcissist. Downey is one of the gifted actors, whom we can discern what is going on in his mind—through his eyes. He brings a crisp intelligence, brashness, and sobering humanity here. We learn that the palladium core that keeps Tony alive is rapidly poisoning his blood and killing him. At the same time S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (cool Samuel L. Jackson) wants Tony to uncover his father Howard's legacy, and solve the mysteries of his heart—on also a more profound level. Tony confesses his estranged relationship with his Father—""He never told me that he loved me."" But in his research Tony watches a message from his Dad. He says proudly, ""You are going to change the world what has always been and always will be my greatest creation is you, Tony"" From then on I was into the movie.""Iron Man 2"" may not be a good as the first, although it has a huge upside. Scarlett Johansson is hot as S.H.I.E.L.D. ""triple agent"" Natasha Romanoff. She looks stunning in tight leather and performing Jeff Imada designed fight choreography. Beautiful and sprite Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Tony's worried assistant Pepper Potts—who Tony appoints as new CEO of Stark Industries. Tony and Pepper are so in love with each other. Will they ever figure this out by the end of the movie? You have powerful actors Downey and Rourke squaring off. Rourke is menacing and dangerous—he plays it dead on. In a subdued interrogation scene Vanko tells Tony, ""If you make God bleed, people will cease to believe in him."" Vanko is out to avenge his own father—defending his own legacy. Sam Rockwell nails the pompous and annoying Justin Hammer, Tony's industrial competitor. Gary Shandling is dead pan genius as the Senator, who demands Tony turnover Iron Man. To which Tony reminds, ""I have successfully privatized world peace."" ""Iron Man 2"" is visually stunning with the spectacular battle with the Vanko built drones at the story arc. It is also a lot of fun as self destructive Tony in Iron Man suit dances to the late Adam Goldstein's mixes. ""Iron Man 2"" is an action packed, fun, and funny mixed bag. It's not all that coherent. It's engrossing mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke, and its surprising story of legacy in spite of itself. And that works as well.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","m_syrus","30 September 2010","I could not watch this movie to the end because it was so boring and predictable that it made me sick. No storyline whatsoever. It was all over the place. I guess writers could not come up with anything, so they decided to copy all the old stuff they knew and dump it in one place. Prolonged dialogs about nothing. In the best traditions of Cold War propaganda that apparently is still alive with some oldtimers, Iron man is fighting against some soviet guy who speaks his native Russian with horrible American accent. They used every single stupid cliché possible. Saving poor scared child, strong independent women wiping floor with poor ""denutted"" men, retarded dialogs , very typical happy end of course. It was like when the character takes one step you already know what the second step will be and how it all will end. When i was watching this movie i thought that the screenplay writer must be or really old and stuck in some time that had long passed or if he is young he is very stupid and out of touch with reality.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","cultfilmfan","17 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is based upon the comic book series created by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The film is also a sequel to the 2008 film Iron Man. Basically, I figure that if you are reading this review and you are interested in seeing Iron Man 2, then you are probably a fan of the original film two years ago, the comic book series, or perhaps both. For that reason I am not going into a lengthy synopsis of the plot because the fans know what they are in for and they are the ones who are going to go and see this movie. The 2008 Iron Man film, I found to just be okay. I think the thing I really liked about it was Robert Downey Jr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He was narcissistic and arrogant and the performance was pulled off perfectly. However there was little else for me to be impressed upon in the first film because I found most of the other performances to be lacking character and emotion, the story really did not do anything for me and the action and special effects sequences went on too long and became a big part of the story, whereas I prefer more background on the characters, the hero and the villains. It was an okay film, but not great. I wasn't sure how I would like Iron Man 2 after my disappointment with the first outing of what is sure to become a series, but I actually liked Iron Man 2 better than the first film, a lot better. First of all, I found the acting a lot better in this one from everybody and the newcomers were really good also. Secondly the film gave us more of a back story to the characters and villain and I found it got more personal this second time around. Instead of just non stop action and explosions there were more scenes letting us know these characters better and I found that to be far superior and more interesting than non stop excitement from the special effects department. I also found this version to have more humour in it and there are certainly some smiles and chuckles coming your way and it made the film a lot more fun and entertaining for me than the first one. I think fans of the first one will likely be a bit disappointed with this version and the reviews tend to reflect this because it is not as action packed as the first film and I have also read complaints that people had of the writer and director trying to put too much into one two hour film. There is quite a bit going on this time around, but I did not find that the film suffered because of it. Instead, I found it gave us more to look at and think about and was a pleasant alternative to the non stop action scenes I mentioned above. The writing I also liked a lot better because it gave us more time with the characters, had a more interesting story and because some of the one liners and humour that I mentioned were in the film earlier. These last few years it seems that most superhero films have been compared to 2008's The Dark Knight because of what a great film it was and I would have to agree. I don't think you will get too many that will get the genre right and give us as interesting a look at it as in The Dark Knight, but we may yet still be surprised. Iron Man 2 while I am giving it the same rating as The Dark Knight, is not as good as The Dark Knight, but as a film in this genre, I do think it is one of the better ones. The Dark Knight was more gruesome, dark and disturbing while Iron Man 2 is definitely lighter and more kid friendly than The Dark Knight and is not as much into the development or psyches of the characters. Iron Man 2 knows this and more, or less just wants you to have a good time watching it and leave feeling entertained. For those goals Iron Man 2 succeeded and then some.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","ZekeRage911","1 June 2010","When I saw the first Iron Man movie, I was surprised at just how competently filmed and well acted that movie was. When compared to all ""Super Hero"" movies before it, Iron Man was easily at the top. Then the Dark Knight came out and sent everyone else packing. Then Watchmen came out and everyone put their stuff away and went back to work.In short, Iron Man is the story of a very intelligent, highly flawed man who can barely keep his life together while facing super-human threats. In other words, every other Marvel character out there. But The movie is so well acted, and the dialog so perfectly askew that you really feel drawn in. It's not over-dramatic (well, a few scenes) but overall it's a solid story. When I heard the sequel would feature A. Whiplash, B. Black Widow, C. War Machine, and D. An army of Iron Man knockoff robots, I was honestly skeptical as to how the movie could possibly not be stupid.The movie was not stupid. A few parts where Tony is ruining his life because he thinks he's dying are, to be honest, a little irritating to watch. But by the end of the movie we really are on his side because he is such a likable character.A lot of people complained about replacing Rhody. In the first movie he was played by Terrance Howard, and in the second by Don Cheadle. People were angry and wanted to know why. I will tell you why. Don Cheadle can act. Terrence Howard can't. Watch his scenes in the first movie, he's blowing his lines everywhere. He's wooden, and uninteresting. Now watch Don Cheadle in the second, he's intense, he's genuine, and he's grammatically correct. ""An unfortunate training exercise occurred yesterday,"" is a line that logically makes no sense. The line is ""An unfortunate INCIDENT occurred DURING a training exercise yesterday."" If that's the take they kept, imagine what's on the cutting room floor, or more likely, ashes in Terrence Howard's agents office.Now while the whole 'secret your father left you' angle is pretty cliché and ham-handed, we quickly forget this as Stark goes back to what he does best, which is wreck his house and build a thing. He's great at building things, and watching him build things makes every nerd giddy. It's like Mythbusters but with CGI effects.Also, Jon Favreau is a very clever devil. Knowing that every fan-boy is looking for signs of the eventual Avengers movie, he coyly inserted a half-formed Captain America Shield into the 'building the thing' scene. Agent Colson picks it up, Tony Stark looks at it in wonder and says ""Yes, that's exactly what I need!"" and then uses it to prop up part of the thing he's built. Yes, friends, it's a meta-fan-boy joke.Oh, and if you DON'T want to sit through the credits to see the secret scene at the end (and trust me, it's not worth it) I will SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT! Tell you what it is. It's a crater in the middle of the desert with Thor's Hammer sticking out of it. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!! So, ultimately, is this movie worth seeing? Yes. It's probably one of the better movies to come out this summer, but then I don't get out much, so I could be wrong, but it cleaned Robin Hood's clock. Say, didn't we HAVE a gritty Robin Hood movie come out already? Prince of something something? Not of Persia? Before I ramble on any more: Surprisingly solid story, well acted, gorgeous special effects, decent action scenes, and Scarlet Johanssen is so hot even my Girlfriend's jaw dropped. It surprised the HELL out of me, I thought she was more into Gweneth.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","gwynjones2001","3 May 2010","I saw this at a free preview in Singapore, so reviewing it seems like the least I can do. More importantly, not only was it great value for a free viewing, but I plan to pay to see it again later this week.Sequels almost always suck, so I was expecting to be disappointed, especially as I loved the first movie (and I'm not a comic book movie fan, generally).Robert Downey Jr is just great, again! Iron Man, and now IronMan 2, is warm, and funny, and entertaining... because Downey is.Supporting characters from last time (Paltrow, Cheadle, Favreau) were fine, and provided continuity. Cheadle had a bit more this time, so we got the bromance thang going.This time Stark's joined by a bunch of new characters. Sam Rockwell was thoroughly entertaining as his arch-rival Justin Hammer, very funny. Scarlett Johansson got to wear some skin-tight outfit as an ass-kicking Russian spy, nice. Samuel L. Jackson, shows up briefly (but very coolly) as a one-eyed spy boss. And the resurrected Mickey Rourke shows off his Russian accent as the vengeful genius with a grudge, and a neat turn in remote controlled drone (very topical) Iron Men.And let's not forget the Ironettes! Even the AC/DC soundtrack was OK (and I loathe AC/DC, they're so last century).If you liked Iron Man, you'll like Iron Man 2. What more do you want, buddy?","3/10"
"Iron Man 2","mikezexcel","17 May 2010","IRON MAN 2 was as good as it gets for superhero movies. It is a well-built story using characters and situations dating back to the 1960's. (Hence the nice addition of Tony Stark's dad in filmstrip sequences). The rivalry between him and a cold war Russian inventor plays out a generation later between Tony and the inventor's son, a character known as Whiplash (but never actually called that in the movie). I have to say the writing was top-notch and the characters excellently portrayed. For any armchair psychologists out there, the child-rearing theory of nature vs. nurture surfaces in Whiplash' origin. The young boy grew up in a climate of hate, and well, this is what happens. OK, getting too deep, more on the fun stuff...Paltrow as Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, the director as ""Happy"" Hogan, and Rockwell as Justin Hammer all did a great job. Mickey Rourke dialed it down a notch and was superb. You will get some laughs from Favreau, functioning mostly as a chauffeur. Adding in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) was a stroke of genius. Her fight sequence deserved applause! A nice touch: her decorative belt rings (first seen in Spiderman issue #86, 1970) became her weapons. Very cool! There's a reason I didn't mention Don Cheadle as Rhodey. His wooden performance was the weak spot of the whole film. I don't get it because he is such a great actor. But his presence was toxic and it looked like he threw off the other actors (noticeably Downey Jr).This film is great fun, balancing character development, science (best invention - Hammer's ""Ex-wife"" missile), thrills, politics and laughs. Highly recommended.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","RavenFilmsAndReviews","10 May 2010","This is one of the few sequels that certainly meets up with if not surpasses the original...Iron Man was the origin story. Now that that is out of the way the story focuses more on Tony facing the consequences of being Iron Man which is great. Robert Downey Jr. is great at delivering those sarcastic lines while remaining completely stone faced. Mickey Rourke as Ivon Vanko/Whiplash is one of the high points of the movie. His Russian accent at times is hard to understand but let's face it he himself is at times hard to understand...There is a great scene in which he ends up being held by two guards. Later he talks on the phone and all we see is blood on his hands and the two guards hanging from the ceiling....Even his death scene was great The visual effects are some of the best. During the flying sequences you feel like you are flying as well...The CGI characters have weight which is so often the downfall of CGI..This sequel comes in a close second to The Dark KnightI highly recommend it","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","disdressed12","22 May 2010","i had high high expectations for this film,since the first one was so good.i'm happy to say i wasn't disappointed.there is more going on this one that much is certain.Sam Jackson returns as Nick Fury head of Shield in a expanded role.Mickey Rourke plays a baddie(with relish and gusto)Scarlett Johanssen's character is underwritten and underutilized,which is unfortunate,because the character is rife with potential.here's hoping they remedy that situation in the upcoming avengers film.Sam Rockwell has an interesting role.Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Lt.Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes,and i have to say,i think he is a better fit.and of course Robert and Gwyneth return as Pepper and Tony.and we finally get to know Pepper's actual first name.for me,Iron Man 2 is a 10/10","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","NORTHPOINTMJM","9 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is everything a summer movie should be, and much, much more. There's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The playboy, hard-drinking, fast-talking, now public superhero (and all the pitfalls of such fame) thrills from opening scene until the last.The movie gets everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting. Downey again brings a winning personality to play as Stark; he finds his pathos, too. Don Cheadle certainly has the acting chops to hang with Downey as does Mickey Rourke. Rourke's Whiplash is the perfect foil and perfect villain because he's no one dimensional character. His Whiplash is on a par with Heath Ledger's Joker (but with less screen time). Sam Rockwell is also perfect in his role. Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson add more sex appeal than any summer film in memory (what outfits for Scarlett) but they also deliver real performances. Pepper Potts is every bit the wise yet sexy match for Stark. The interaction and the relationships all work well and is one of the highlights of the entire movie. All the dialogue is superb. You would expect nothing less from a Jon Favreau film. (Who's also great as Happy Hogan, that fight scene raiding Hammer HQ is priceless!) A lot of superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. IM2 is darker than the first but keeps in line with the wonderful tone it already established for this character and universe. Again, Iron Man's creators mix everything so well. It leans towards dark but touches on every other tone and emotion. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they had Downey's talents to play with but Downey's performance leads to more clever banter and genuinely fun dialogue than most other movies have ever delivered, regardless of genre. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Downey's Stark is glib and even obnoxious at times but he never loses his likability and grows in to something more, drinking problems, fear of dying and all. That's true character establishment and development in a summer film!!!! What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that most every plot turn carries some emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix great acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. Oh yeah and Iron Man kicks butt again both with and against War Machine! The CG is perfect and the action is intense and very well done. That's no shocker. What was a pleasant surprise was that Iron Man 2 is now officially in the running for best movie of the year, again regardless of genre.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","SubZeroMK","7 May 2010","When I first heard that Iron Man was being made into a movie, I didn't care much, but I still wanted to see it because of the action. I also chose to see it because Robert Downey Jr. was playing the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark. I've been a fan of Rob since Chaplin, that was truly a masterpiece, he can work the English accent perfectly. I always thought he was English because the first movie I saw with him was Natural Born Killers, but he was obviously Australian in that.Anyways, I finished watching the movie and I was blown away by the sheer awesomeness of it. So, I chose to go back on my comic book hobby that I used to have 8 years ago. I first picked up on the World's Most Wanted storyline that is part of the Dark Reign event. I was hooked, so I decided that Iron Man is my new favourite Marvel hero, next to Blade, they're on the same level of epic. I read a famous story arc called ""Extremis"". I LOVED IT! I loved the dark tone to it, the virus created by Pharmlabs in Austin, Texas somehow slipped into some criminal's hands and he went haywire. Iron Man saved the day by taking the same dose of Extremis, he and the suit TRULY BECAME ONE, just like he says at the Senate conference in this movie. I won't say much because you'll love reading it, and it's really fun acting out the captions.Anyways, the next storyline I'm reading is Civil War, it's interesting to see his position in all of it. I still have 74 issues to go. My point is, if you're an Iron Man fan like me, and if you read the comics (which REALLY helped) then you will consider this the best movie in move-making history. I certainly do, we will see how the Avengers can top this, but I know Iron Man 3 will top Iron Man 2.Now, onto the movie. The intro starts off really well, with recordings from the ending of the first film where he announces that he is indeed Iron Man. It then cuts to Moscow, Russia where we get to see Whiplash's character intro. Truly sad to see the hand dealt to his father, Anton, apparently his father worked with Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father, and somewhere along the line, Howard took Anton's ideas and kicked him to the curb, in the Russian ghetto. Whiplash swore revenge on this, and let me just say the way the Monaco scene was setup was just AMAZING.On top of the movie being awesome, it even added humour to it, just like in the last one. Happy Hogan gets more screen time and lines. We get to see more of Nick Fury and the sexy, and seductive, Black Widow just to put the cherry on top. Justin Hammer, rival competitor to Tony Stark and Stark Industries wants to conquer over Stark Industries with H.A.M.M.E.R. advanced weapons systems. But he knows that he can never get the praise and approval of the public like Tony gets. It triggers his ego to go haywire, he truly needs Tony to succeed with his company.Moving on to the plot which is very well done and fantastic. This is a Marvel fan's wet dream come true. It combines the story lines of Armor Wars and Demon in a Bottle. Tony Stark's arc reactor is keeping him alive and killing him now, at the same time. He needs to come up with a solution and a new suit, which he does later in the course of the plot. This film is truly a masterpiece directed by none other than the prestigious Jon Favreau. Him and Robert are the DREAM TEAM as I like to call it.The audience was cheering was laughter, enjoyment and praise. They gave it a standing ovation after the movie was over, a theatre full of joy. I must admit, I really do envy Robert Downey Jr. for the kind of man he is. He has been dealt with the hand of jail and he has had his own little demon in a bottle experience,but the got back up on top, along with Mickey Rourke and has been given a second chance, and he took it.The acting was superb by all the cast members. The special effects and action had fans like myself drooling for more of it, just to appreciate the sheer beauty of it. I can guarantee you that this movie will make A LOT of money, maybe even over 1 billion and I hope it does because of the incredible hype it has received and well deserved too.The movie has a special Captain America easter egg and a secret ending after the credits. So stay in your seats. The music was very well done and in the right moments.Iron Man 2 gets my envy and full respect. This is truly the movie of the year, and possibly the decade until Iron Man 3 can top it off. People asked has the Dark Knight set standards too high for comic book movies? I'd say it didn't set them high enough, Iron Man 2 SURPASSES TDK in every way possible. This movie is godly. Rob and Jon are the dream team, never forget that people and Hollywood. They are the future of the movie industry. LONG LIVE IRON MAN!P.S. Oh and as of this year from May 6th to May 10th, you should all celebrate IRON MAN DAYS. On those four days, celebrate the great achievement Stan Lee and Jack Kirby has created.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","tieman64","9 May 2010","Perhaps because he is primarily an actor, director Jon Favreau graciously gives actor Robert Downey Jr room to run wild in ""Iron Man 2"". Favreau, who even plays Downey's servant within the film, turns the reigns almost entirely over to his leading man, every sequence designed to both make him look good, and submit us to his iron will.Indeed, Downey isn't just ""Iron Man"" in this film, he's a manic God, manipulating machines, computers, TV screens, existing 3 steps above the rest of his cast and outsmarting everyone, either physically or via witty comments. And when Iron Man's not dancing on stages, applauded by audiences or wooing women, he's taking part in action sequences which first require him to order disc jockey's to fire up some music. Every thing Downey does here is self-consciously a theatrical performance. Ironic meta-acting taken to the extreme, no longer does the action hero merely wink at the audience (""Indiana Jones"", ""Die Hard"" etc). No, meta has gone one step more meta, the actor now playing the god, playing the god, playing the god in the machine. It's not only a question of super-reflexivity, of postmodern irony squared, but rather, a kind of contempt for all material. With plot pastiched to hell, reinvigoration has nowhere else to go but inward, the actor now as fragmented and cut-and-pasted as the film he's in.Compensating for this fragmentation is Downey's own need to dominate. His need to be the deity outside the character playing the character playing the character. Compare this to the straight faced Joker in ""Dark Knight"" who, despite supposedly being an anarchist, looks completely old-school next to the freewheeling Downey (or Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow).Interestingly, unlike most superheroes, ""Iron Man"" has no need for anonymity. He's pure ego, allowed to be a celebrity, a public figure, a playboy, a rich kid, a toy maker, an invincible muscle man, a billionaire industrialist and a one man military industrial complex. While most superheroes function as power fantasies, ""Iron Man"" goes several steps beyond. He's a very white, Western, 21st century fantasy. A celebrity superhero for the reality TV generation; everyone must know his name.Whilst Favreau is gracious to Downey, submitting the film to the actor's improvisational talents, he also provides space for his film's other heavyweights – Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke - to run wild. Rockwell hams things up, Rourke goes to Brando lengths to internalise his character and Don Cheadle projects his usual air of noble earnestness. Beyond this, all three characters are poorly written.Surprisingly, the film rectifies the big mistake of the first ""Iron"" film in that it mercilessly removes much of its dull action scenes. Aside from one surprisingly good sequence in which actress Scarlett Johansen engages in a bit of martial artistry – the best pop-corn wire-work since the Nightcrawler sequence which opens ""X-Men 2"" – the film downplays action in favour for sitcom level rapid fire banter. This has ticked off audiences, but spectacle is largely dead. Most recent films praised for their action (""Avatar"" et al) are completely inept, turgid and/or outdated.Of course, thematically the film is horrendous. At times it looks as though Faverau wants to use Rourke as a tool to highlight Western blow-back, the hypocrisy of peacekeepers like Iron Man and their dark pasts, but the film steers clear of these things. It knows that treating the Rourke character seriously would take things in a direction audiences can't handle, so Rourke is repeatedly pushed off into the sidelines. The result is the usual Hollywood fascism: a message of anti-militarism married to gleeful explosions, hardware and mayhem.7.5/10 – ""Iron Man 2"" is all about Robert Downey's iron penis. About performance. About a kind of self-conscious, actorly domination, Downey dazzling us as he goes off on his insane jazz rifts. Now all the franchise needs is Shane Black and an R rating ala ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"".Worth one viewing.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","carlosta83","28 April 2010","This Film from start to finish is genre perfection, the script the acting the cinematography the little bits of detail that makes a great film, the effects are out of this world, so good you don't even think about them. Overall this tops Spiderman 2 and by some distance i might add as the greatest comic book film to date. To start script is sharp witty, off the cuff, it quite often even verges into the Tarantino realm of dialog, so good are Downey JNR, Rockwell and Paltrow, that even the most menial of scenes become enjoyable, Rourke who was a worry for me was great not over the top and camp right on the money and also brought a great physical presence to his role. Johansson while looking the part, is the only weak point of the film for me, but even this is a minor note. But Rockwell, and Downey are close to perfection. With Rockwell having one of the better monologues in recent memory. Plot, pacing and coherence are perfect the movie just flew by didn't want it to end. There are no wasted scenes each is a treat onto itself no over indulgence or hammy dialog.Cinematography, mise'en scene, action, effects are all top notch. Sat in awe of how Iron man looks about four thousand times more realistic than spider-man, action has a really visceral impact without ever being choppy or shaky cam. Again cinematography is the major stand out and to quote R Lee Emmy film looked any better ""it would be a modern art masterpiece"" Directing is great i am now a devoted follower of Faverau he has taken all the annoying clichés and boring formulas that we keep seeing in these movies, and given us an action movie with brains brawn and the patience and execution to back it all up. There are no cop outs or annoying walls of writing where you can tell script is out of ideas and they just plonk something on the page, this is thought to the T, there is so much detail here its hard to take it all in, this one of those films you can go back and watch fifty times. From Bill O'Reilly to Amanpour from CNN, to Larry Ellison. There is something in every frame.So summing up don't listen to the pandering,sycophantic reviewers all agreeing with each other this movie is a real treat, weather your ten twenty or even fifty years old there's enough here for everyone it doesn't treat you like a 2 year nor does it go all star trek with the tech speak. This is the Comic book film we have all been waiting for go so fourth and enjoy. And Remember to stay till the end of the credits.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","naman-avastol","29 April 2010","Before Iron Man was made John Favreau said he can never imagine anyone except Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and as we know RDJ's career went to a totally different level after that movie... Iron Man 2 promises the same.. Not many think that this movie could achieve the status the previous one achieved but mark my words, it will provide double entertainment as the previous one.. Sure its ending is also not up to the mark as the previous one but Robert Downey is the star his action sequences, his comic timing and his one liners are so brilliant that u might tempt to give an Oscar to him right away! Mickey Rourke as Whiplash is superb as ever! He is mean, he is strong, he is dangerous.. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is sexy and perfect, although many may complaint about not being given the full description about her character when she is introduced in the film.. Don Cheadle beats Terence Howard as John Rhodes in this movie.. But the real surprise came in the form of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer.. His performance was a delight! Gwyneth Paltrow was same as the previous one..To conclude this movie promises to deliver double awesomeness in form of action, humor, special effects and everything.. Don't Miss this one!!My Rating: 10/10","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","theblacksuit3","8 May 2010","I really liked this movie with one exception, too much unnecessary comedy. I liked how they spiced it up with all the giggles, but some of it was just too much, and it retracted from the seriousness that Iron Man is supposed to be. I also heard that black widow was useless, and her character was necessary. I was at first upset that she didn't have the accent, but it would probably conflict with Rourke's character, so its acceptable. But overall the acting was great, especially on Rourke's part, and the FX were great. And to be honest, I like Cheadle better than Howard as Rhoades, they should have gotten him in the first place.","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","nikomailand","2 May 2010","Do you remember how you felt right after having watched 'The Empire Strikes Back'? 'The Return of the Jedi'? 'The Matrix'? Or the first Iron Man movie?If you are like me, I would guess pretty darn excited -- 'Can't wait to see what happens next'! Now try to remember how you felt after watching 'The Phantom Menace' and 'The Matrix Reloaded' -- Well, after watching two of the biggest travesties in the world of sequels... I felt completely frustrated, angry and cheated! I won't say I feel the same resentment after having watched Iron Man 2 but it comes pretty darn close.Iron Man 1? A fantastic movie! Iron Man 2? I want my money back! And my travel expenses! What is wrong with Iron Man 2? Do you have a couple of hours?Maybe...no script? Really, are these guys serious? They make a movie costing around $150 million dollars and the script SUCKS BIG TIME.Plot holes anyone? There is NO motivation: you have no idea why you should care about the characters, since the characters themselves don't have a clue what they are supposed to do or feel and why in this story. I'm not saying the actors are bad, they are doing all they can, but they are given a crappy script to work with.No sense of suspense or danger: despite one hundred of explosions and a couple of thousand stray bullets in crowded areas, NOT ONE PERSON gets killed or wounded in the whole movie! The closest you get to 'wounded' are a couple of bruises. How am I supposed to care for someone when I KNOW he won't get hurt? This is a MAJOR difference from the first Iron Man movie, where the threat was real.Somebody desperately tried to make Iron Man 2 into a movie for all ages -- well, it worked, in the worst possible way.This is also why all of the action scenes are boring, since all you see is CGI animated cartoon robots bashing into each other -- sounds a lot like Transformers you say? That's right, but with EVEN LESS human emotion, since no one gets hurt.It was pretty difficult to mess this up, but they somehow managed to do it.I've read all the rave reviews -- ""action packed!"", ""entertaining!"" ""terrific!"" Are we talking about the same movie here? Seriously guys, either you have a very low standard or you have never watched a movie that truly deserves those rave reviews, like: The Matrix and the original Star Wars trilogy. And no, I'm not comparing Iron Man 2 only to 'classic movies'. Even newer movies like Star Trek or Kick-Ass or even Iron Man 1 were ten times better! Kick-Ass was made for $30 million, instead of $150 like Iron Man 2 and it completely kicks Iron Man 2's ass in every department.I want to erase Iron Man 2 from my memory but I'm afraid it will be very difficult -- still having nightmares about Jar Jar Bings -- Thank you Iron Man 2 screenwriters, for ruining the Iron Man 1 experience for me. I wish I could sue you.Why I still give it 5 stars? Because the actors tried. And because I smiled a few times. That's it. A DVD throwaway movie at most, it really wasn't worth my money.","1/10"
"Iron Man 2","madhavb","8 May 2010","Jon Favreau knew exactly what he was doing with this movie. This is a sleek, no-holds barred superhero movie, with great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke. Let's face it, it was almost impossible to top the first one; nevertheless this a good sequel to one of the best superhero movies ever made. Scarlett Johansson fulfilled her role as the the sexy and cunning agent Natasha Romanoff, and Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as Pepper Potts. Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's competitor, and does a pretty good job at it.The only problem I have with this movie is that too many things have been fitted into 124 minutes. I understand that the movie was meant to be a roller-coaster ride, intended to thrill, but a little more character development would certainly have helped the movie. For example Samuel L. Jackson ans Johansson's characters are underused. Also, the ending was a little disoriented and predictable; something just didn't feel right about it.All in all, Jon Favreau has made a movie that would please the fanboys and satisfy the critics. This is a movie that entertains, while still complementing the first movie, and setting up a third movie.

Iron man 2 has everything you want: The spectacular action, the witty dialogue of Downey, the good performances, and the babes(Scarlett Johanson we're talking to you).I knew what was expected. I was anticipating a lot. And yes it's hard making a sequel to a movie that everybody loved. So if it doesn't quite add up to the original, you have to cut them some slack. And some people have been disappointed. Me, I wasn't. I'm a little mixed as to if it was better than the original. But for a sequel, this is the best. Well, not compared to The Dark knight or Spider-man 2, but this is a worthy sequel with still a lot of greatness.Now that everybody knows that Tony Stark is Iron man,the government wants his suit. So do people like his competitor Justin Hammer(played by a funny Sam Rockwell) and Ivan Vanko(played by Mickey Rourke), a Russian scientist trying to get revenge on Tony because he believes that Tony's dad stole his dad's idea. Meanwhile, Tony promotes Pepper(played again by Gweneth Paltrow) to C.E.O. of Stark industries. He is a love triangle(sort of)between his new assistant(played by Scarlett Johanson) and Pepper. and lots of other things happen also.I know that I spoil a lot when I talk about a movie. But there is a lot to the plot here.Iron man 2 is hilarious and rather awesome at times. If it's as good as the first one is a little up in the air for me. Can't quite decide.But just know that this is the best film of Summer 2010 so far.Iron man 2: A+","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","tfrizzell","8 July 2010","Loud migraine-inducing sequel which is made kind of like a two hour-plus music video with enough lights, cameras, and action to keep those with short attention spans happy for a few short moments. The movie takes off where its predecessor left off as Robert Downey, Jr. (in the titled role) has become a major international celebrity, but he has issues abound as the U.S. wants his weaponry for the obvious reasons. Meanwhile, arms producer/dealer Sam Rockwell and Russian recluse Mickey Rourke come into play as the antagonists. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson make appearances to obviously set up ""Iron Man 3"" (I feel another major migraine coming on). And of course we have Gwyneth Paltrow (boring as usual as the love interest) and the usually dependable Don Cheadle (taking over for Terrence Howard who clearly knew better than to get caught in this franchise) who round out the main players in the all-star cast. Yes ""Iron Man"" makes a load of money at the box office, but critically there is not too much to talk about. Downey, Jr. seems content with playing the ham (think ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Sherlock Holmes"") as his better work (""Chaplin"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck."") seems a very distant memory. He has fun with the material and runs with it, in spite of the fact the substance is lacking in most cinematic areas. The screenplay is wishy-washy and Jon Favreau's (who also has a substantial acting role) direction does nothing to help in the end. Much like the original, this one is just a loud clunker that makes you root for the bad guys who keep up the intensity with their witty one-liners and tongue-in-cheek humor. 2.5 out of 5 stars.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Floated2","10 July 2010","I watched Iron Man 2 earlier today and I found it quite boring and annoying. I am not a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. but I liked the original Iron Man. Personally I found this film boring because of the lack of action and the amount of talking. Also another mistake of the movie was letting Don Cheadle replace Terrence Howard. Cheadle and Downey Jr. did not have the same great chemistry like Howard and Downey Jr. And Iron Man's character is very weird in this. For example their a scene where's he's at a party in his suit. That was very awkward to watch.The story is also very predictable and well not that great. While watching I was also very confused throughout the movie. I liked the villain he was cool enough but other characters were annoying like Scarlett Johanson and that other girl. Iron Man (2008) was great because they didn't overreact with the story, I just didn't really like this movie. Granted it had some good moments but not enough for me","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","Palidan400","15 May 2010","It's fun and fast-paced. Robert Downey Jr. delivers again, with all the cast doing great jobs. Contrary to popular (critic) belief, Iron Man 2 brings another enjoyable superhero film to watch. The storyline continues to unfold, the action and effects are nice, and the actors all did well.Whatever complaints other people might have on the story, the events, the lack of or excess of - it may be true, but that doesn't make it less of a great movie. Iron Man 2 was more character driven, and you truly do see many of the past characters and new ones develop. Thanks to the well-picked cast, all of the characters were fun to watch. They gave emotion and humor together, and I'm too lazy to talk about each of them individually, but Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was definitely the savior of the whatever flaws the movie has. As he said himself, he is Iron Man, and his personality made the movie very lively.As expected, you got to see awesome Iron Man action with lots of explosions and whatnot. Some might say that there was too much mindless blasting, like Transformers, but that's what made it fun. It mixed in with the characters evenly I think, and it's an overall great and fun movie throughout.Not saying it didn't disappoint in some parts (which it did), but you can't please everyone. I find the first Iron Man to be better, but that was because it was a new, cool idea that just bursted out. However, Iron Man 2 continues as a worthy sequel. People just need to sit back and appreciate what's there.The ""ending"" is cool, too. Make sure to watch past the credits.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","euthymic89","3 May 2010","I have to admit that the first movie was better but let's not compare. In all fairness, though the ratio of dialogue to action is 3:1 (more or less), I was still caught in awe the whole time. I am deeply amazed by the power of technology that was being depicted in the movie and how Tony Stark made use of such immensely spectacular hi-tech things combined with his wit and intelligence. It was literally all in the palm of his hands.The storyline is great. It has shown another side of the Stark Industries' success and legacy which gives rise to the vendetta perpetrated by the infuriated and angst-y villain which was played really effectively by Mickey Rourke.Robert Downey Jr again affirms his compelling appeal, charm and skill on-screen. He's a really cool superhero with a mix of humor, narcissism (in a cute way), and fiercely gallant persona, not to mention HOT as hell! Scarlett Johansson is amazingly badass!! Gwyneth Paltrow is still beautiful.The movie maintained its humor which could irreproachably burst the cinema into laughter. I was expecting more funny scenes though. I guess I was expecting too much. But the serious side of storyline didn't fail me.The effects were really cool and great. This movie makes Transformers look bad. The robots here are BADDER! really badass. Pay attention to the dialogues, they are really penetrating.Watch this movie. It would live you wanting more. Truly mindblowing and kickass! P.S Stay until after the credits.","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","toseale","31 July 2022","Iron Man 2 has plenty of epic scenes - new heroes and villains making insane entrances, a beginning cameo that sparks intrigue in fans, fights that really keep people interested, and a couple suit ups that should go down in history. But altogether, the movie doesn't have much to it. It's poorly written. Sam Rockwell made a fun introduction to Marvel as Justin Hammer, a major villain for Robert Downy Jr.'s Iron Man. Hammer is joined with Mickey Rourke's Whiplash, which isn't something I'll complain about, but both villains are a little boring. This entire movie is just Tony Stark's past coming to haunt him, and it doesn't make for a good story. There's plenty of epic moments, as I've said before, but they don't mop up the poorly written movie.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","fighteous","29 April 2010","To classify Iron Man 2 as an archetypal sequel wouldn't justify the effortlessness in which it flows seamlessly from the original Iron Man's story; the film takes pride in picking up straight from where its predecessor left off, and in beautiful fashion. As a whole, IM2 feels more of an add-on to its predecessor and focuses on tackling the issues arising from the fallout incurred from the ending of original Iron Man.Having said that, audiences shouldn't just expect a hollow romp of recurring Stark-isms, repetitive action sequences and a predictable storyline. IM2 definitely has an edge over the original in its case of moral dilemmas and intertwining relationships between old and new characters, and to top this off the plot line of IM2 has so many unexpected and original turns that the film is so engaging it makes most other comic book adaptations appear sheepishly predictable.Having less opportunity to rely on Stark's antics to dazzle audiences, Robert Downey Jr. succeeds in adding a realistic amount of depth to Stark's character, and as such, the issues of alcoholism, sickness, mortality and the international weapons race can be tackled with a believable attitude by both the actor and the director. Thanks to a touch of genius from the writers, actors and director, these serious issues are tackled without compromising the fun, super-savvy feel of the Iron Man franchise.As a film, Iron Man 2 wasn't simply a carbon copy of Iron Man, and as such it wasn't what I expected. The film was approached in a much different way by those who made it and I think this is a very good thing. They've kept life in the Iron Man/Avengers franchise, introduced new characters without feeling like they are forcing Marvel memorabilia down your throat, and closed a dark episode in the Iron Man saga without changing the pace or tone of the franchise.For me, this movie marks a fantastic achievement for Favreau and Marvel Studios. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original Iron Man.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Hitchcoc","29 December 2010","With the eye-popping special effects front and center, we need to again delve beneath the surface and figure what separates this from other blockbuster superhero movies. This is a fairly captivating effort, but it doesn't really advance things that much. I suppose Robert Downey looked tired because he was, after all, dying in the film, but I also got that little bit of smugness that comes from walking through the part. Still, there's a great villain who can match well and some great technology to keep things interesting. One of the demands of this is to make your protagonist somewhat vulnerable. It falls just a bit short at times in catching us. Still, I liked the byplay and the fun and don't regret having seen it. I liked the first much better because it has a more sophisticated plot and substructure.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","Kirpianuscus","9 April 2018","At first sigh, it is not exactly the expected part of series. because something missing. but the lead sin - a not realistic accent to the vulnerability of Tony Stark is saved by the genius of Robert Downey Jr., giving one of the most credible and nice character from Marvel universe. another good points - Don Cheadle as Lt. Rhodes, Scarlett Johansson as Romanoff and, sure, Mickey Rourke as a vilain who impresse more for its past story and for a sort of old fashion ambiguity. short, a nice film for not the fans of Marvel industry.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","aaronjbong","1 May 2010","'Iron Man 2' has been the most anticipated movie of May, and yet the year 2010. So many action scenes have been awaited in this movie including the appearance of 'War Machine', 'Whiplash', 'Black Widow' and not to forget, new armors of 'Iron Man'.Action scenes have been the most anticipated thing in this movie. Too bad, the movie didn't put a lot of fighting scenes. The fighting scenes are only a few and they are pretty short. In around 124 minutes of duration, I have expected around at least 40 minutes of those to be fighting scenes.All the visual effects and the story are not really a problem. The blasts, explosions and damage, they were pretty perfect. The details were also satisfying. Only fighting scenes were the real missing things.The fighting scene at the end was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it especially when they're up against 'Whiplash'. But, the fight was way too short. There were like only a few moves they did and done. It needs more action scenes. In total, there were like only four short fighting scenes.In summary, 'Iron Man 2' was satisfying but needs a lot more fighting scenes. But, the movie was still great. 8 stars for 'Iron Man 2'.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","BA_Harrison","8 October 2012","The sequel to the excellent Marvel adaptation Iron Man isn't as strong as the original in the story department, being a fairly routine 'villains vs good guy' tale that does little to develop the central character; it also suffers from some interminably inane dialogue (people are talking, but they don't really seem to be saying much). Thankfully, the film compensates somewhat in terms of sheer spectacle and excitement (and I'm not just talking about Scarlett Johansson in a figure-hugging leather catsuit!).The first of Iron Man 2's incredible action set-pieces introduces Mickey Rourke's Russian villain Ivan Vanko, who causes mayhem during the Monaco Grand Prix in an effort to kill Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and thus avenge his scientist father, who he believes was cheated outed of fame and fortune by Tony's father Howard. He fails of course, but not until he's trashed several F1 cars mid-race, slicing them in half with his 'power-whips'. Great stuff!Vanko is given another chance at killing the playboy billionaire turned superhero when unscrupulous weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) busts him out of jail and gives him the means necessary to develop an army of drones. The film culminates with the inevitable smack-down between Iron Man and Vanko's obedient robot warriors, a satisfyingly chaotic battle full of big guns, grinding metal, and destruction on a massive scale.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.","2/10"
"Iron Man 2","donmurray29","30 April 2010","First of, make sure you stay after the credits, again. Second, this seems to be a very wordy film.Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke have great dialogue and Don Cheadle replacing Terrance Howard is on form too, you get great action and great performances from all, a very good second film, but one more and that is it, at least you can see what is going on, unlike Transformers.You often wonder how they can do a next film after the first Iron Man was so good, well at least they handled the two main villains a lot better than I expected. Action is much harder than the last one, so try and get a digital showing, I saw at Vue in London on the 29 of April, so the crowd was small, no kids.An interesting super hero film, wait for third film to compare them all.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","MovieZoo","7 May 2010","All these months of waiting on Iron Man 2 and my worst fears have been realized. You can rest assured that I am not going to glorify any of what I saw because I feel like I owe it to anyone or anything or because I was happy with at least a small part of the movie.This was like Spider-Man 3 or Superman 4 Quest for Peace. It was only a shell of a superhero movie. Why any time was spent on Tony's ailment, is a puzzle to me. Why? Because so much time is spent showing us that no ego is stronger than his.How can anyone care that he is sick? I know I didn't. Nothing endeared him to me. His self centered, near sighted outlook on life made me sick. His overinflated ego is the near death of my interest in this franchise. It is not Downey's fault, although I still wish he had not been selected as Stark in the first place.It had plenty of boom and bang tempered with ooh and ahh. Unfortunately for fans of the noise, it was short-lived in two different parts of the movie. For me, I don't care how loud the noise is or bright the flashes are as long as they are used intelligently. In my mind, that was the only thing that Favreau decided to give the fans, apparently not knowing we are not all like he is. To help you understand how much Favreau disappointed me, his presence on the screen repulsed me. When he decided to put his character in one fight scene, all I could think of was how little he must have understood what makes a superhero movie a good movie. I thought it was totally self indulgent and neglecting the attention the moment required. He just couldn't help but rush to a joke throughout the entire movie. Hopefully, this was his last shot at making a superhero movie. But wow, thanks for making money for the studio, eh? I give kudos to Rourke, Paltrow, Cheadle and Johannson. Paltrow's involvement was upgraded to a different level, showing her strengths just as she should have. And although they never got much of a chance to build much, Johansson and Cheadle made their presence very noticeable with hopes of more to expect in what I hope is a recoup of quality in Iron-Man 3(which would mean Favreau-less). My favorite scenes though were with Cheadle, as the denied friend and as War Machine. He was truly the best part of the movie. I hope Johansson comes back as Romanoff again, I liked her in this role. As little time she had on screen, this was one of her better roles. I think this character fits her fine.Rourke was a great villain. But I felt he was not quite as fearsome as the trailer made me believe. I was entirely engrossed with his character until he died. While his Vanko seemed truly capable of being evil, his demise was almost anti-climatic. His leaving the story made it even more of a disappointment because Rockwell's Hammer was allowed to live. BTW, I never liked Rockwell's Hammer because his character was as much of a joke as Favreua's take on this movie.Getting back to the loud explosions and bright lights, one scene near the end is the best example of why this Iron-Man is a great example for a weak superhero movie. While a large portion of the city is in flames, where is Iron-Man? Why, he is too busy talking to Pepper about her future. Dying children, women and men, ahhh, too busy here, folks. Iron-Man has a thing for this woman. Can't be bothered now. Give me a superhero who can't be bothered to help mankind and I give you nothing in return. I was hoping throughout the movie to see his ego fade away. Matter of fact, I had thought he learned a lesson near the end of the first Iron-Man. Guess I was wrong.4 out of 10 - plain and simple. Suggestion: wait til the DVD hits Redbox. And disregard the positive reviews for the movie itself, it sucked.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","StarkTech","30 April 2010","I love this quote by Robert Downey Jr.: ""I can honestly say that Tony Stark is the coolest character I've ever played. If I look at anything, it's the mythology that has grown up around him and how I can use that to raise this movie to a really high order of art."" Mission accomplished, Robert. IM1 took the comic book genre to the highest level and IM2 builds perfectly upon the first film. Downey and Favreau again deliver a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. In fact, the action is taken to the next level while sacrificing none of the complexity or heart that made the first film a pure classic. I totally agree with most of the film critics who are praising Iron Man 2.Iron Man 2 does indeed do the near impossible and that's improve on the first film. It really is as fabulous as you've heard and as good as everyone is saying. The entire cast, the crew, the FX people and writers should all be as proud of this exceptional movie as they were of the first film. Nice job!","3/10"
"Iron Man 2","bass7-730-880956","5 May 2010","First, let me get this right; I am a FAN of the first Ironman movie;the American war propaganda machine looses its hero (the best weapon producer) when the Ironman character realizes after being confronted with suffering and death that peace is guaranteed by ""having a bigger stick"" than your opponent (good so far,.., but nevertheless fun with a bit of criticism); ""welcome tony stark, the most famous mass-murderer in human history""(Ironman 1)- great; and so Ironman is created by tony stark, a charismatic, smart genius (very good performance from Robert Downey Jr.);and here in Ironman2: NOTHING, NO STORY, NO PLOT, EVEN NO ACTION; NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT; just nothing; the tony stark character isn't even smart anymore; he is just arrogant and sometimes accidentally funny;when you watched the trailer you have seen ALL the action sequences (and i really mean ALL!) in the whole film; the whole film is filled with senseless dialogues; why replacing Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle??? Terrence did a good job, Don Cheadle doesn't fit in (although he was great in Traitor) Mrs. Paltrow is just annoying, annoying, annoying; Samuel L. Jackson just makes a 2 min commercial for the avenger movie; Sam Rockwell, well.., not so good:)the only positive thing are the action scenes with Mickey Rourke at the beginning (just at the beginning..so about 5 min)and Scarlett Johanssons scenes ;) If you liked transformers 2, you will be satisfied with this brainless try of entertainment; My native language isn't English.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","george.schmidt","11 May 2010","IRON MAN 2 (2010) *** Robert Downey, Jr., Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, John Slattery, Jon Favreau, Paul Bettany (voice), Leslie Bibb, Garry Shandling. Downey returns in fine form as Tony Stark AKA super hero IRON MAN in this serviceable yet streamlined sequel to the franchise that has more hits-than-misses yet manages to keep its tongue-in-cheek screwball comedy underpinnings intact. This time Stark is facing two significant threats: Russkie sociopathic physicist Ivan Vanko (Rourke in top-notch menacing mode echoing Charles Bronson) whose life-long grudge against the industrialist has reached its head – and weaselly competition Justin Hammer (bantam Rockwell milking every oily turn he can) – and a threat to the global peace he has managed to uphold with his alter ego. Adding fuel to the fire are daddy issues, a diminishing heart source and doubling his pleasure with amiable administrative assistant/right-hand-babe/squeeze Pepper Potts (the lush Paltrow) and newcomer to the fold Natalie Rushman (curvaceous-to-a-fault Johansson) AKA Black Widow) while contemplating Nick Fury's (Jackson reprising his bad-ass/eye-patched hero) offer. Favreau's fluid direction (and comic side-kick theatrics) punctuates the familiar tropes yet one feels some punches may have been pulled (i.e. Cheadle is largely wasted in taking over Terrence Howard's ""Rhodey""/WarMachine and the final confrontation is frankly too quickly resolved). But fans will be chomping at the bit for the next installment and/or the promising-to-happen AVENGERS flick.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Wuchakk","29 March 2016","Released in 2010, ""Iron Man 2"" naturally continues where 2008's ""Iron Man"" left off. With the knowledge that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is also Iron Man being made public, he must contend with serious heart problems, Daddy issues, alcoholism, a competing rat (Sam Rockwell), a mysterious new employee (Scarlett Johansson), a personal assistant who is now CEO and who also loves him (Gwyneth Paltrow), a friend who becomes a War Machine (Don Cheadle), Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) and a vengeful Russian with ties to his father's legacy (Mickey Rourke).I like this sequel better than the popular original because I generally don't like ""origin stories,"" as far as superhero movies go. More than that, ""Iron Man 2"" brims with confidence and is just full of kinetic entertainment from beginning to end, highlighted by a rockin' soundtrack and some curvy cuties, most notably Scarlett as The Black Widow (the character's film debut). On top of this, the writers add some meatier elements to the table, like Tony's father/son issues and his sad struggle with alcoholism (which comes straight from the 80's comics, the first superhero to be depicted with this problem). The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in the Greater Los Angeles area of Southern California, Monte Carlo, Monaco, and New York City.GRADE: A-","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","tbone82094","27 April 2010","This sequel is definitely up on par with The Dark Knight in my book. The story and acting is so believable that it seems as if they are the characters and the graphics are definitely upgraded from the original film!!! Then the armors and weapons all look as if Iron Man and War Machine could be reality. Now don't get me wrong there is a good amount of dialog in this film but it does the film and characters justice. So you'll really understand where the characters come from. Even though I thought Terrence Howard was great as Rhodey, Don Cheadle was just as good like I predicted. Mickey Rourke really shined in this role as he did in Sin City and The Wrestler, his presence gave the me the same reaction as Heathe Ledger did with The Joker just speechless. Bottom line is that if you loved the first Iron Man and are a fan of the actors and director, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL!!!!!","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","arnieiam","8 May 2010","First things first how did this sequel one up itself from it's predecessor? Continuity: The film takes place 6 months after Stark reveals his identity in the first film and the entire plot is driven because of that.Characters: Downey Jr. is back and his freestyle acting yet again is what brightens his screen time. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodes, which really didn't bother me that much because personally I think both Cheadle and Howard are brilliant actors. War Machine will not disappoint. Mickey Rourke plays Ivan Vanko who is a hybrid of the Crimson Dynamo and Backlash and this character should have been given more screen time. Paltrow comes back as Pepper and her ability to keep up with Downey has improved. If there is no Mandarin for this film at least they got Justin Hammer another well known foe who I think should have been the villain of the first film. Scarlett Johansson plays the Black Widow, pretty much that is a character for the male audience. And Sam Jackson plays Nick Fury.Action: It had a lot more bad-assery (hope that's a word) than the first film, a lot more. However it wasn't presented like that in the trailer, which therefore I was sort of hesitant to expect greatness. If the trailer was presented like the A-Team thats coming out this year or the first Spider-Man film eight years ago then I would have bought my ticket way in advance. But don't be mislead, there is a lot of action sequences.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","theaxekeeper","10 May 2010","Tony Stark, is back in this high-octane, high action summer blockbuster. The film picks up right where the first one left off, where Stark reveals that he is Iron Man. We are introduced to a new villain named Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke. We soon find out that he and Mr. Stark have much in common with their past. Meanwhile Jimmy Rhodes, played wonderfully by Don Cheadle, must deal with the government and Stark's crazy antics. This is just a reader's digest version of the story, I want to talk about the film itself. This film is the first of this summer's blockbusters. This film is bigger, louder and more action packed than it's predecessor, which not necessarily a bad thing. With the addition of Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson really brings a ""freshness"" to the story. Director Jon Favreau has done another fantastic job, proving that he is a first rate action director. The characters are great, Paltrow gives a great supporting performance, Downey is funny and series as ever, and Rourke is a force to be reckoned with. The visual affects are very good along with solid sound editing, however, I do feel that Johansson and Sam L. Jackson, where a but underutilized. I really enjoyed this film, but I was hoping to see more from these characters. That's what sequels are for. I do like this film, but it did lack in some parts where the first one succeeded. I do love the special affects, but they could have been better. Unfortunately with the passing of special affects wizard, Stan Winston, who worked on the first film, it did loose a little luster but not much. Overall I was a satisfied as a moviegoer and a future film maker, I would definitely go see this film again. It is worth your money, but unfortunately, it will probably be overshadowed by the mind-numbing, horribly acted, D rated special affects, crapfest known as ""Twilight"". But hey, that is my opinion, and I'm sure people have other opinions, and that's OK.","7/10"

"Iron Man 2","zactac","8 May 2010","You know summer has begun when studios release the first summer blockbuster of the year. Iron Man 2 is off to a great start with starting summer. The film is deeper in the story, the characters are as funny and charming as ever with the edition of some new characters, and action to keep you happy and satisfied through-out the entire film.In this film we see how Tony Stark is now a big celebrity and has helped bring what seems to be world peace. However, he has enemies on the move and are going to try and show the world that even Iron Man can bleed. So now with time running out and new mysteries about his own past to solve, Tony has a lot to do for this exciting follow-up to the 2008 blockbuster.The film has everything the average summer movie-goer wants to see in a film, great action, beautiful special effects, well-written script, and characters that you just have to love.

"Iron Man 2","TheHonestCritic","26 September 2019","""Iron Man 2"" (2010), this movie is equally as good as the first movie. What's with the hate it gets? It's definitely a worthy sequel to ""Iron Man"" (2008). Granted, it's not quite as good as the first film. But, I still consider it a perfect movie by my standards. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack. The story is a continuation after the first film. After the opening scene, it takes off with no looking back. This movie digs deeper into a strong story, with a lot going on. The first one had a lot going on, but this one has a lot more subplots. But, they are all resolved in the end, and that's what's important for a well done story. Once again, Robert Downey Jr. is pitch- perfect as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper, and Don Cheadle does a good job as Rhodey. To be honest, Don Cheadle is not as good as Terence Howard in this role. However, he does still work as a passable substitute as Rhodey. Scarlett Johansson joins the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie. She does a great job, and she puts out her second best performance in this one, out of all her roles in this franchise, with her best performance being in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014). Mickey Rourke does an excellent job as the villain; Ivan Vanko, and Sam Rockwell does a great job as Justin Hammer. The sets/locations are beautifully laid out, and work perfectly with the context of the film. Obviously, being 2010 when this film was released, the special effects are first rate. Finally, the soundtrack is well composed with the tone of this movie. Overall, this is a solid sequel, and every bit worth watching as the first movie. I never understood the unnecessary hate it gets. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. ""Iron Man 2"" is a very entertaining movie, and one of the best sequel films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. It's 100% worth a watch.

I should say, that even though I do still think it's the worst film in the series, it's not actually all that bad, but it feels a long way away from where we'd be just a few years later.Having declared himself Iron Man to the world, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) faces criticism from his government that his suit is a weapon he wealds without oversight and should be handed over to the army. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has a vendetta against the Stark's since his father helped develop the initial arc reactor but was then disavowed and exiled. Creating his own arc reactor and powerful whip weapons, Vanko is narrowly defeated by Iron Man, but Stark's professional rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) sees an opportunity to one up his bitter competitor, he breaks him out of prison.Again, there is much setup in this film, Scarlett Johansson debuts as ""Natalie Rushman"" in a role that owes slightly more to ""the male gaze"" than I really remembered. Eventually though she suits up and we see something of what Black Widow would become. James Rhodes gets his suit. John Slattery takes over the role of Howard Stark, Garry Shandling makes the first of a couple of key appearances as Senator Stern. Kate Mara has a tiny role as a US Marshal which feels like it really ought to pay back into the MCU again somehow.The problem with the film is that it sags massively in the middle. Once the Monaco scene is over, it's almost entirely talking until the final fight, which is somehow both long and underwhelming, given how easily Ironman and War Machine despatch the drone army. I do like a lot of that talking, some of it, like the sitting in the doughnut bit has become iconic, but it's noticeable that my son (whose 10) struggled a lot more with this film than he did with the first one.Marvel's worst film is better than a lot of people could manage at their best, but it does feel like this was just a bit before Feige really nailed down the formula.","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","bowmanblue","26 May 2015","Yes, the original 'Iron Man' movie was Marvel's 'surprise hit.' They were probably going to do a sequel anyway, but I'll bet they never thought they'd be pushing so heavily towards this side of the franchise. Anyway, it's fair to say that a sequel needs to give 'the same and more' and, to be fair, 'Iron Man 2' achieves this.It's bigger, louder, more special effects and more heroes/villains added into the mix. Personally, as a casual comic book-movie fan, I quite enjoyed it. I always thought most people did, until I read the online message boards, where it turned out that opinions were pretty divided on its merits.So, just to let you know that there's a sizable proportion of people out there who will disagree with me when I say that it's a pretty fun romp. No, it's not Shakespeare and it doesn't really try to be. I guess it's supposed to appeal to young fans (dare I say male fans?) who will buy the obligatory Iron Man T-shirts, Iron Man lunchboxes and Iron Man pyjamas. No, I didn't buy any of those, but I still enjoyed the film.Unlike other superheroes (think Batman, Superman and Spiderman), the 'secret' identify of our Iron Man isn't that secret, for at the end of the original film billionaire playboy Tony Stark decided to reveal to the world that he was the man in the iron mask – so to speak. Therefore, in Iron Man 2, he's an even bigger celebrity than he was simply for being the owner of a multinational arms manufacturing firm. It's actually quite nice to see an 'alter-ego' who's actually more 'ego' than anything else. Yes, he's a bit of an idiot. You probably wouldn't see Bruce Wayne getting drunk wearing the Batsuit at a party and using his Baterang to slice watermelons thrown from an adoring crowd. You see that here.Perhaps that's Iron Man's appeal – he's a bit of a plank and we can relate to his love of adoration? He is definitely a flawed – if very lucky – individual and he makes a change from the usual brooding hermit that most superheroes are portrayed as.Naturally, it's Robert Downey Jr's charm that carries the film through, but it's fair to give his supporting cast a mention. Naturally, seeing as the film's not called 'Iron Man and Friends' they have a lot less to do and a lot less material to work with. But they do okay to play off the star. If it's not a bit odd to say that Sam Rockwell's villain came across as a bit too 'comic-booky' for my liking (yes, I know it's a movie based on a comic book) – it just felt like he was trying a bit too hard.I know 'Iron Man 2' has its critics and I guess it's not perfect, but it is fun. It's nearly two hours and I always think one of the true tests of a movie is whether if feels like its runtime. And, in my opinion, Iron Man 2 flies by like a man in a yellow and red metal suit.Bust out the popcorn and enjoy.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","851222","13 November 2018","Greetings from Lithuania.""Iron Man"" 2 (2010) had a lot to live up to its great first part. It everything to be a great sequel, same director, more money and freedom, fresh and hot from his Oscar nomination performance Mickey Rourke but at the this movie failed. The reason is pretty all over the place writing of the story. I mean the story itself was OK, but not its writing. The pacing also suffered as they tried to show to many things at the same time.Overall, Iron Man 2 is the worst from its trilogy. It lacked everything that first movie had. Its not a bad movie, but its a very poor sequel considering its great original.","3/10"
"Iron Man 2","bob-rutzel-1","10 October 2010","Everyone knows that Iron Man is Tony Stark (Downey). What everyone doesn't know is that he is dying, but yet he has to find a way to defeat Vankov's (Rourke) Iron Man drones.There is Dumb (Iron Man 1) and there is Dumber, Iron Man 2. This is a CGI show and it's pretty good. But, the story suffered badly from a very bad script especially in the beginning when the audience needs to be grabbed. Much of the dialogues seemed dubbed in, just like in Iron Man 1. Not much had changed. Downey and Rourke come off better than anyone else in the cast. Paltrow seemed lost again like in Iron Man 1. Johansson, while still looking good, was wasted except for some Karate, Kung Fu and JuJitsu stuff if that was really her. Looked good though with those moves, whoever it was. Don Cheadle needs to stop being the second fiddle sidekick, and needs to find his own movie again like Rwanda. He is truly wasted in here. Rockwell seemed tentative in his bad guy role. Jackson seemed disappointed that he couldn't pontificate more. Like I said, this is a CGI show and it was spectacular, but the script really hurt the effort. Again, there is dumb and there is this. Let's all light a candle and hope there is no Iron Man 3. Now, if you are a true Iron Man fan, go read the comic instead. It's far better than anything Hollywood could do.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No hard stuff was heard, but the caption in the beginning saidMild Language, which means you could see the lips form the F-bomb words, but not hear them.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","filipemanuelneto","16 July 2022","After an excellent first movie, this was a predictable sequel, but I have to admit that the movie is a bit over the top and that, sometimes, it feels like a very expensive video game. Furthermore, the main character, Tony Stark, is perhaps one of the nastiest and most irritating comic heroes, and this movie seems to try to accentuate that by turning the protagonist into a spoiled playboy who has expensive toys and looks at women like if they were, also, toys. Okay, I know the character was also portrayed like that in the original books, even though I'm not a comics fan. But the movie could give something that made Tony Stark someone we could really care about.In this film, the hero will face his first great antagonist, the son of a Soviet scientist that Stark's father knew. At the same time, Stark has to face the US Army, who are eager to get their hands on the combat suits he created, discovering that his father knew of a new chemical element, not yet officially discovered, and in which lies the key for the survival of Stark himself. With these brief lines, we can see, right away, that the script is not exactly one of the strong points of the film. The feeling that remains is that the script shoots in several directions, trying to create a more complex story, but that something got in the way and prevented that objective.The cast basically has the same names as the previous film. Robert Downey Jr. Is back to the red armor for yet another film, where he has shown himself to be deftly sarcastic and irritating without losing his heroic pose. Mickey Rourke is a welcome addition to the cast, playing the villain. The actor was able to adapt to the character quite competently. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also return, but they don't do more than they did in the previous film, still fulfilling what was asked of them. Scarlett Johansson deserves a praise for her work here, but the rest of the cast just do what needs to be done.The film is yet another very expensive blockbuster, abundantly financed by Marvel, and it is very obvious that it will become one of the most watched films of the season. With so much money and financial interest involved, the film was doomed to a loud and flashy bet on high-quality, but still obviously false, effects and CGI. The film has a lot of action and the fights are excellent, although obviously choreographed and stilted. The cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and magnificently beautiful. The film bets a lot on quality props, good sets and costumes, as well as a good soundtrack.","5/10"

"Iron Man 2","JAM-31","15 May 2010","Okay, I am not a big comic book fan, nor do I know too much about ""Iron Man."" I am a big-time movie fan though, and there are certain things that a comic book movie (and basically ANY movie) needs to be successful.And they are: THRILLS... EXCITEMENT... SUSPENSE... STORY... ""Iron Man 2"" has none of them. How does a movie like this get released without them? ""Iron Man 2"" has no exciting plot for the hero to overcome to stop drastic consequences. No exciting action sequences to keep us on the edge of our seats. I don't know or really care how much this film keeps to the comic it was based on--if it doesn't have an involving, exciting story, it fails.All of the actors, Downey, Johannsen, Favreau, Rourke, Cheadle, give mediocre, forgettable performances. All of them are good actors who I have enjoyed watching in other films, but seem to just be trying to be cool, hip, and clever in front of the camera this time.This film should have reminded me of the ""Batman,"" ""Superman,"" or ""Spiderman,"" films, but it has more in common with the ""Ocean's 11"" movies: a bunch of big stars hamming it up, trying to be ""cool,"" and having fun in front of the camera, instead of trying to make a good movie.What does Mickey Rourke's villain want in this film? How will it affect the world if he achieves his aims? Why should we care if he succeeds? Why are there no moments when Iron Man seems on the verge of losing everything? This film is an example of letting success go to the producers' and actors' heads. Hopefully the fan-boys will realize and admit it stinks before more action and comic book films turn out as dull as this one.Grade: D","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","ironhorse_iv","3 July 2013","Directed by once again Jon Favreau, Iron Man 2 in my opinion fault to live up to the original movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not awful movie. It was pretty OK for what it is. A popcorn flick. It just wasn't as good as the original, but hey it's still worth noting. Iron Man 2 was more a comedy than an action movie. Iron Man 2 starts out, with after the events of the first movie. Stark has just revealed his identity as Iron Man and is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the technology. Meanwhile, in Russia, scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to seek revenge against Tony Stark (Robert Downing Jr.) as he believes that Stark stole his father's technology. Mickey Rouke as Ivan Vanko isn't a bad choice, but his character had little to no development. While the movie would love to point out that he is Whiplash from the comic books, in truth, he was on film a combination between Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo (the original Anton Vanco). Both Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo in the comics wore more body armor than the guy in the movie. Most of the movie, you see him fail into everything he does. In no way, does I see him as a seriously threat to Iron Man. The movie could have made him sinister, but gladly use him as comedy with a running gag about getting a bird. Also in most of the film, we don't even see Iron Man in action. Tony Stark literally spent the last half of the movie in his basement making the ultimate suit to fight a ton of drones that went out like a candle in the wind. The thing that annoyed me about it was how his father's intention for this incredible, impossible to create super-sustainer type thing that will changed the world, is made in like 2 days by Tony Stark and is essentially used to replace a double-A battery in his chest. Trying not to spoil the whole movie, but I found the ending fights really disappointing. 23 minutes of action in 124 min film is too little for a blockbuster film, far less than Iron Man. Even the middle fight in the film is pretty much pointless as it waste time. It's remind me of the fighting scene in 1988's They Live where the two heroes duking it out for little to no reason just for comedy. I think all the comedy, hurt the story ark for Tony Stark's depression, alcoholic, and poisoning arch. It was never taken serious in many scenes. I was really hoping for 'Demon in a Bottle' like story arc. Sadly as long as Disney Marvel control the movies. There will never be a Demon in a Bottle storyline. Plus, I don't even think Monaco Grand Prix would have allow a clearly smashed, poison and untrained driver Tony Stark to drive a racing car in a race with other drivers. We came to see Iron Man, and what did we get 2 short action scenes, a depressing finale, and tons of Avengers references. So there were a lot of Easter Eggs in this movie, but I didn't get a trip on it as much as I hope. I mark a little bit, I have little interest in it. Back to the movie in hand, all actors and actresses did swell jobs, but the one that really broke out of its shell was Sam Rockwell as Rival defense contractor Justin Hammer. So let me see the bad guy in the first Iron Man was a white business tycoon, using an ethic minority as a cover for their own plot, the second was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, and the third was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, true inspiration there. Tony Stark's sidekick, Colonel James Rhodes went through a change, too. Terrence Howard got replaced by Don Cheadle. What I believe is the reason why, was because Terrence was overpaid for the first movie, they slashed his pay for the sequel drastically. Once Howard's agents were informed they were taken aback at the huge pay cut. He back down. The studio had always wanted Cheadle for the part, Howard says. It's weird that Colonel James Rhodes can control War Machine armor so quickly in this film, while it took a while for Tony Starks to get uses to being Iron Man in the first movie. Scarlett Johansson is sexy as Black Widow, but her character development wasn't there. She was pretty much in the movie because she's eye candy to the comic book fans. Talking about eye candy, Gwyneth Paltrow is just there to suck up screen time as Tony's love interest, Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts. Iron Man 2 had some bad dialogue. Characters often talked, but there was never an indication that a character might actually be listening. The conflict was forced and the plot loosely strung together, there was a lot of filler content than actual story. Even Robert Downing Jr. himself, said that this movie turned out not-so-good (paraphrased) mainly because Marvel had way too much control over it and deleted so many scenes which would've done much to. It seemed too bland to me personally, just pointless action, plot holes and dumb plot elements. In the end, this movie is way better than Iron Man 3, and not as good as Iron Man.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","Anuradha108","4 May 2010","I've watched IM2 twice so far, and am eagerly looking forward to the 3rd this Wed with a special friend. I'm also planning a possible trip to London to see it in Imax in the near future when I save enough money.I'm sharing some radom thoughts about IM2:What holds the story is a more in depth exploration of Tony and his relationship with his father, Pepper Potts and Rhodey. The spirit of the movie is fun and the subject matter is interestingly human and the actions are a blast. Robert Downey Jr is again breath-taking as Tony Stark. The romance between Tony and Pepper is a breath of fresh air and very endearing.The visual effect is spectacular, especially when Tony is making a breakthrough in his lab – it's like he's one with the whole universe! I enjoy Black Widow single-handedly handling all the security guards at Hammer industry with crisp karate moves mixed with high tech devices. However, I find it hard to relate to her emotionally as she's often expressionless and humourless. She's like a highly intelligent and sexy robot, or alien – effective, but lack of more fleshed-out human dimensions.I like Don Cheadle in the War Machine suit, but not when he's out of it. I feel he lacked the upright posture as a Lt. Col. His body language does not fully embody the spirit of James Rhodes.In my first viewing, I think Tony's out of his mind, down right miserable and ridiculous, and frankly I missed his boyish good look, and resented his sickly haggard look. But the movie took me to another place, and suddenly I can relate to what it's like for a genius billionaire to face premature mortality and have no one to share his fear and regret, not even his love interest or best friend. I can relate to the desperate sense of isolation, powerlessness in reaching out for help, helplessness in simply getting some understanding from the one he cares most, and the need to escape into a donut.I like the more in depth exploration of Tony's relationship with his father, Howard Stark through the contrast of his nemesis, Ivan and his father Anton. Even though Tony's born with the privilege, wealth, and talent, he grew up feeling unloved by a cold, distant father and then orphaned at a young age. Ivan, on the other hand, grew up in poverty, lack of recognition and imprisonment, but shared a deep love with his father.I think Ivan Vanko is a well-developed character, and Micky Rourke very much nailed it. He has a strong and intimidating screen presence yet can still connect with the audience through deep emotions and humour.I love it when Tony finally discovers his father's love for him in an old tape in which his father told him that Tony was his greatest creation. For me, that's the equivalent to the ""Proof that Tony Stark has a heart"" Pepper gives Tony in IM.It's interesting that Robert further explored the father issue in his next movie, Due Date.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","tripxyde","30 April 2010","I thoroughly enjoyed IRON MAN 2. But there are some very minor stuff that sort of bothered me. First off, I did like the character played by Mickey Rourke, which is Ivan Vanko (which seems to be a combination of the comic book characters Whiplash & Crimson Dynamo). But I felt that the details of the character were too underdeveloped. We got to see his some of his quirks and a little bit of back story which we thought was going to be spotlighted later on in the movie. Only to realize that the back story which felt like a teaser was not fully satisfied in the end anyway, and we walk off the movie not really having a full grasp what his character was all about. If the story wanted him to be a mysterious ""force of nature"" villain, the film should not have heavily teased on a back story in the first place, and should have gone with the fully mysterious psycho all the way. Basically his character was out to have vengeance on Stark, accusing his family of stealing an idea his (Vanko's) father pioneered. But in the end, it really was not clear what that ""stealing of idea"" was all about, or how Vanko's father was allegedly betrayed by the Stark family.You cannot dismiss the movie as just a superhero movie because like any good superhero movie, the story focuses on the story's characters rather than on just the superhero. The film does not solely rely on action, but much on humor. There were moments in the middle of the movie that made me forget I was watching a superhero movie, or an action movie. Much of the movie centers its focus on Tony Stark's relationship with his friend Rhodes, his assistant Pepper Potts, and his rival Justin Hammer. The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow is very sparklingly attractive and fun to watch.Don Cheadle was fine as Rhodes, Tony Stark's friend. But the fact that he is not physically consistent with Terence Howard, the actor he replaced for the role, messes up what should have been a fluid consistency with the previous Iron Man movie. In the end you forget about it (and he is, in comparison, as good as a replacement as Maggie Gyllenhal was in replacing Katie Holmes in the Dark Knight movie).Robert Downey Jr. is magnificent in his role. His Tony Stark is like the new role model; girls throw themselves at him & guys wanna be like him. His humor is always on the spot and his charms are flawless. His screen presence and how he makes a scene come alive is the major battery that makes this an enjoyable film.And then there's Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury. Which reminds me of the other nitpick detail that hated about the movie, and that is Nick Fury's first appearance in the movie. For a character which is supposed to have some degree of importance, his first scene looked like it lacked impact. Fury, appearing and having a conversation with Stark, in morning daylight, while wearing that shiny coat, made him look like a joke. And then we see the first costume appearance of Black Widow in the same scene, which also made her appearance have no impact at all. In fact, it was a scene that awkwardly made Nick Fury and Black Widow look silly and indeed looked like two people wearing costumes for some Halloween party. Even though the first line of Fury was indeed very funny, I still stand by the opinion that it was one scene that was just poorly conceptualized.Comedian Garry Shandling also appears in the movie, and although his role is not a major one, I consider him to be a highlight of the movie. He plays a Senator who is very skeptical and critical of Tony Stark and seems to have a shady background. His role was deadpan serious and almost villainous that he instantly feels like an un-ignorable beloved ""other villain"". From the moment he appears you can tell that he's supposed to be a big A-hole, and he does a great job with it.Jon Favreau who is both a great actor, comedian, and is also the director of the movie did a great job in making this sequel spectacular and continuously fun to watch. Despite its flaws, the movie was very enjoyable. It was well-paced, and designed never to bore its audience. The dialogues are very witty. And its performers do a marvelous job with their lines. It also had interesting non-cliché comedy gold moments. One of the funniest scenes that I enjoyed involve Robert Downey Jr. and one of those office decorations (you will know by the time you watch the movie). Although I felt that there would have been many interesting stunts or refreshingly new action tricks that can be made with the new villains (especially one with a super-powered whip), I cannot disregard the fact that the film invested more on the storyline aspect so to not make this movie just a mere ""dumb action flick"" that wants to appeal to all audience demographics.All in all, IRON MAN 2 is a High Matinée movie. Although greatly flawed, these flaws are only noticeable from a critical point of view. Even I came out of it with a full-bar fun movie experience, and only realizing its flaws hours later. If you love a movie with witty characters and some cool heavy metal robot action, then this movie is definitely for you. And let me remind you that there is an additional scene after the end credits, so if you don't wanna miss it then you might wanna stay awhile for it.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","Jerique","12 May 2010","What can I say? Jon Favreau can never disappoint. Whether he's funny as an actor or artistic as a director. He's a master of his craft and definitely found his niche. He's an amazing director, with an uncanny ability to cameo in his own movies as a great comic relief.Robert Downey Jr., is an actor I've been watching for years. From being sweet and hilarious in Heart and Souls, to sarcastic and witty with an edge of drama in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang to perfecting his ability in playing Tony Stark. Robert is versatile and can go beyond some of the other great actors.Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect female to play Pepper Potts, as seen in the first film. She's funny, she's brainy, and she's sexy. She's got a beautiful face to look at and a sweet voice to hear. Her character, Pepper, takes a backseat for screen time to make room for others, but she still plays a prominent role in Iron Man's future.Samuel L. Jackson, gets a small cameo and Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as a really sexy, seductive, ass-kicking seductress who bounds to keep both Tony Stark and audiences on their toes. Don Cheadle comes along as well to play sidekick and Mickey Rourke is chilling and terrifying as villain Ivan Vanko.There's mind blowing special effects, triple the intense action sequences and give just the perfect amount of comic relief and you've got a sequel that does ten times better than the original. It's not surprising. Iron Man, wasn't bad by any means, but it just feels inferior to this. I can't imagine how it will seem when the third chapter is unveiled.Strap yourself in for a roller coaster ride of a lifetime. It's fun, it's dark, it's full of surprise and it's action packed. It's a great film for everyone. Grab grandma, grab your friends and let's go see Iron Man 2!","9/10"

"Iron Man 2","fernandoschiavi","5 October 2016","Comes to movie screens the long-awaited sequel to one of the best superhero movies of all time. Although not present more innovations and have that freshness in the air of novelty, the superhero continues to surprise further intensifying the relations of his characters amid good action scenes.Unfortunately the major flaw this sequence is that it does not innovate in relation to the first, just repeats the formula of the original, with the effects and technical finesse are even better. Robert Downey Jr. once again dominates the screen with Tony Stark supporting and appear well. It is interesting to show the threats suffered by Stark in this sequence: problems with disease caused by the use of armor superhero, the conflict against the U.S. government, without talking in very grotesque villain played by Mickey Rourke on the big screen.The screenwriter Justin Theroux to have performed the comedy ""Tropic Thunder"", entered many catch phrases and dialogues with much humor, sarcasm favoring even more especially applied to Stark. It's great the way Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux concatenate the connections between the characters and their pasts. The two new villains, Vanko and Hammer are totally anti-Tony Starks, forged from the same cast of heroes, in the best tradition of Marvel Comics. The action scenes are good but very ""lying"", but not something that you take the merit of the film. Favreau's direction is more focused on the characters than on action. The exaggerated scenes are few, and some deserve comment. The scene at the track racing in Monaco that appears Whip Black are spectacular and shows that he can actually be the one to represent a threat.We highlight the struggle of Black Widow with security that is graphically amazing and exciting - a shame that beyond this fight scene no more scenes in which the character appeared most prominently, but the Black Widow presented is cold and calculating, causing identifying who already know the character, not to mention physically and red hair characterization also does an excellent job. Also during the final scenes, the fight between Iron Man and War Machine against the Black Whip could be much better utilized. Until now we have to understand the reason for the fight have little time with the villain being eliminated very quickly. There was to be an epic moment of the film sensational confrontation and fell well short and disappoint.Robert Downey Jr. is clearly more comfortable in the skin of Stark again and steals the scenes in which is all the time. Again the comedic talent and wit of the actor and his obvious charisma deliver a character that was supposed to be annoying, arrogant and endowed with self-destructive behavior, one of the most beloved characters of today.The chemistry between Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell is great, resulting in truly funny moments. Even with Rourke's character having an essentially dramatic motivation, it becomes not only grim, making the balance between evil villain and intimidating with the spirit sarcastic and not afraid of their opponents, a wise decision on building character. The Black Whip interpreted by him is a mix of villains Crimson Dynamo and Whiplash own, which had some identities and the first was Ivan's father, Anton Vanko, who appears at the beginning of the film dying in his son's arms. Then came the specialty in electricity control. In the film, Whip Black / Whiplash has the name and nationality of Crimson Dynamo in the comics. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodes with competence. In the female cast, Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson does not have the screen time they deserve, but still has good scenes.The soundtrack of John Debney, who had worked with Jon Favreau on Zathura and who also signed the soundtrack plots as Sin City , dreamy and Hannah Montana - The Movie, is another high point and makes us vibrate in moments of action. The music track once again show the touch of rocker adventures and we can enjoy for example, ""Shoot to Thrill"" and ""Highway to Hell"", both AC / DC, among others.The references to the movie ""The Avengers"" are also a bit more punch with appearances by Nick Fury, who makes this is an important step towards the future Avengers movie - the reappearance of Agent Coulson and the connection made especially with the film Thor is quoting the phrase you're going to New Mexico to investigate something and culminates in the post-credit scene of the film. Undoubtedly for fans of Marvel scenes are a great appetizer for what lies ahead.   Compared to the first film, we can not say that this does not have its merits, but it lacked something. Maybe he missed a story more elaborate, with more conflict and action scenes better distributed and best enjoyed over two hours. Technical requirement in the movie is perfect and knew Jon Favreau once again lead the story well, even gaining more prominence as an actor with his character in this film gaining more space in a good sequence in which he is the Black Widow. Another factor is the pace that has more ups and downs than the previous adventure, improving over the last forty minutes from long. It is undeniable that the film is pure fun of the highest quality. Iron Man certainly not rusted and still has much to be tapped in future sequences! Bring on Iron Man 3 and hopefully Shane Black has the same responsibility toward that Favreau had these first two episodes of the franchise.","10/10"

Much like Spider-Man 2, the truly remarkable special-effects of the new movie make it virtually impossible not to suspend one's disbelief. The effects actually beat Spider-Man 2. A lesser filmmaker would have been content to let the effects be the whole show, but Favreau gives us a movie populated by genuine characters and situations that make the film just as compelling in its quieter moments as it is during the big action scenes. IM2 combines the thrills of a big summer romp with the craftsmanship of a prestige studio picture. It's not simple popcorn fun although it certainly works in that capacity but it's as complex as its conflicted protagonist. It's a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor that's well-acted and masterful at every turn. That's the kind of movie that I love to see one that isn't just dark to be dark or isn't just self-indulgent or overly serious for the sake of having some sort of false sense of gravitas. These Iron Man films are sweeping and even epic but, at the same time, they're tremendous popcorn entertainment. How many films can you say that about? Truly Superb.","3/10"
"Iron Man 2","d_art","19 May 2010","In Iron Man 2, Robert Downey Jr. returns as billionaire Tony Stark, this time facing pressures from the government to share his armor technology with the military. At the same time, he discovers the technology which keeps him alive is also slowly killing him. He appoints Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of Stark Industries, while her old job goes to Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson). Meanwhile, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the son of his father's enemy, joins forces with Stark's rival competitor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell).First off, I enjoyed the first Iron Man, but I wasn't a huge fan. I felt Jon Favreau's direction and Robert Downey Jr. made the film better than what it could've been. Tony Stark was fun, story was okay, and the villain was a bit disappointing. The idea of the villain being just another version of the protagonist never appealed to me. I felt the same way about the wannabe-Hulk villain in Incredible Hulk. Now, if the villain is very different from the hero (Joker vs. Batman / Superman vs. Lex Luthor / Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock), the hero has to apply different strategies, which makes for more entertaining battles. Well, in the Iron Man sequel, that idea hasn't changed too much—Iron Man still battles a similar foe, although there are now more of them. Thankfully, the shootouts, the flights, the computerized special effects, and the mass destruction are a lot of fun to watch, but it is not the central focus.This film's focus is all about the characters, an unusual direction for a sequel. It's no Transformers 2, that's for sure. Majority of the time, you won't see Tony Stark in armor. You do, however, get to see a bit of a darker and a vulnerable side to Tony, which happens to make him more complex, engaging, and sometimes, dangerous. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony flawlessly, and he's just as much fun, if not more, than before. Some may be put off by the dialogue-driven first half of the film. The film isn't all about ""let's hurry up and get him to fight somebody."" In fact, it takes its time, and there's not a whole lot of action in the beginning, but there's a certain build-up that leads to the eventual confrontation with the baddies. The film isn't so much about a specific villain or a goal, but it is mainly about Tony, his psychology, and his reactions to life. Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts—she is as we remember her from the last film—charming and continuously getting Stark out of trouble.Many interesting side characters make an appearance this time around. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) plays more of a prominent role as the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. Scarlett Johansson has great screen presence as Natalie Rushman (aka. Black Widow)—she holds herself pretty well in a great martial arts scene. Don Cheadle has replaced Terrance Howard as Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" and gets to play a more prominent role as an Iron Man suit-armored partner to Tony. This film, unlike the first film, tends to lean towards the idea of teamwork more. (Perhaps they're just prepping us for an Avenger film?) Mickie Rourke is engaging on screen as the Russian physicist villain Ivan, which he plays with dark relish. Although his technology—glowing, electrically charged whips—isn't anything new, he is always fun to watch. Likewise, Sam Rockwell is great as usual as a villain, the wisecracking Justin Hammer.The plot simply continues on from the last film, after people have found out the true identity of Iron Man. While it's nothing too complex, the progression of the story is logical--it would surely bring some enemies out of the woodwork if they knew who he was. The film's pacing isn't as zippy as the first film, where something always seems to be happening, and some audiences may be disappointed as a result.Overall, I found Iron Man 2 to be entertaining and a worthy sequel, and just different enough not to feel tacked on like an add-on to the previous film. Many sequels can get lazy—they just throw in everything and make it bigger and louder. Some sequels simply let the story progress. This is that kind of sequel. I give Iron Man 2 *** out of **** stars.You can also follow my reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","thinker1691","2 October 2010","From the incredible, innovative and often futurist mind of comic book artist, Stand Lee, comes this sequel to his hero. The Film is called "" Iron Man II. "" Director Jon Theroux, follows the basic character Iron Man, and challenges him with several new problems at once. First the alter ego of the Iron Man, Mr. Tony Stark, (Robert Downey) learns, the atomic power pack in his chest is not only saving his life, but is killing him at the same time. Secondly, his best friend, Lt. Col James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is covering for his friend but is also trying to secure one of the top secret iron man suits for the military and with the help of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) may well succeed. Lastly, there is the main frame heavy, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke, excellent acting), who vows to destroy Stark for betraying his father. Samuel L. Jackson, John Slattery, Garry Shandling and even Stan Lee all make cameo roles. The film is action packed, exciting, and promotes audiences to expect more in the following sequel. If that isn't enough, there is Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow who provide eye-candy with a attitude and a powerful executive allure for Stark. The movie is a worthy addition to the original and if you over-look a few minor flaws, such as none of the military figures, nor the police or the security guards are female, then the movie is well done and audiences look forward to the next. ****","3/10"
"Iron Man 2","faisal_khatib","1 May 2010","I hadn't seen the original Iron Man movie in the theater and so I blamed that to not liking it i.e. the big screen awe effect of having a super hero bash different villains was missing. So when I heard about the sequel, decided to watch it in the theater. Till yesterday morning, I thought it was a 3D movie but on checking the local cinema website I realized it wasn't. I think not having it in 3D was a huge mistake cause even though 3D is over rated, I'd think a movie like this would have gained a lot from it.I was a little excited after seeing everyone else looking forward to be amazed by Tony Stark aka Iron Man but 2 hours later and the only word that came to my head was rubbish. That's how bad I thought the movie was even though everyone else seemed to like it in bits.The problem is when I think about comic book movies, I have this high expectation because a comic book has so much material to build on so I assume the movie will be amazing and apart from a few, most of them are disappointing. I'm not a huge comic book person but I know a bit about them to know how bad these films always end up being. I suppose it's similar to the problem that the Harry potter movie series faces.Now talking about Iron Man 2. The story revolves around Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.), the rich multi millionaire play boy super hero who has privatized world peace. How the government is trying to get their hands on the technology/weapon that is Iron Man while trying to replicate it with the help of Hammer industries run by Justin Hammer (played by Sam Rockwell). This time we also had a side kick in the form of Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (played this time by Don Cheadle) who was the other Iron Man (?). Then we have Ivan Vanko (played by Mickey Rourke) who manages beat Iron Man up in their first clash with his garage built whip thing called whiplash and then gets hired by Hammer industries and creates a droid army and a new suit for himself. Wish they'd given him more of a role apart from talking Russian and sarcastic smiles/giggle.The ladies in the film were Pepper Potts (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff (played by Scarlett Johansson). Pepper Potts is Tony Starks secretary/love interest/better half etc  whatever you want to call it. Gwyneth Paltrow sleep walked through her tiny role which wasn't a bad thing while Scarlett Johansson was the eye candy(?) of the film to make the hyper guys happy. Tight clothes, skin show, kicking ass (literally) kind of summarized her predictable cliché role.Finally we had the one eyed Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who tries to knock some sense into Tony Stark who goes off the hook in the middle of the movie. I wonder why Samuel L. Jackson agreed to do such an effortless role. Maybe it has something to do with the movie The Avengers.Few things that annoyed me... - If Ivan manages to beat up Iron Man so easily in his poorly funded garage project, I'd assume killing Ivan later on when he's got a whole new armor (with the backing of Hammer industries) would be quite a work out for Iron man and his sidekick butthe final show down between them was short and just too easy. - Don't call the creation of a new element an almost impossible procedure and then make Tony Stark create it without any hassles. - Yes we know what USA thinks about Iran, Pakistan, North Korea etc. You don't need to keep reminding us that through movies as well. - Yes Tony Stark is a playboy but do you really need to stuff that fact into our face every single time. - Justin Hammer was annoying...enough said. - Villains are important, give them more to say. - Do you really need a character in the movie for guys to ogle over.I'm sure there were more points but I just can't break my head over it. Honestly, Robert Downey Jr. did a good job playing TonyStark/Iron Man but the movie was just too boring, lame, predictable, cliché etc that his decent act couldn't save it for me. Overall I'm glad I just paid AED15 for the movie...it wasn't worth anything more than that.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","hte-trasme","7 May 2010","I caught this movie with friends and in doing so became probably one of only a very few people to see it without having watched the first ""Iron Man"" movie. Knowing the basic premise behind the original comic book, though, I found that ""Iron Man 2"" holds up very well entirely on its own, and as a piece of entertainment is a thorough success with nary a dull moment. Like any good action movie, I think, ""Iron Man 2"" realizes it can't consist entirely of action, and this one at times feels just as much like a comedy or political thriller as it does a superhero-based special effects spectacular. That comedy is rooted in and succeeds because of really good character work, particularly with the lead Tony Stark. The script by Justin Theroux (who is, I found to my pleasure, related to the other writers Paul, Louis, Marcel, and Alexander Theroux) shows a facility with pointed, revealing dialogue and a whole lot of wit. This script also seems preoccupied with getting characters to declare -- if not in so many words ""Oh, yeah? Well just try and make me!"" which is deeply satisfying to empathize with even if it does eventually become a little repetitive as a theme. Robert Downey Jr gives another simply brilliant performance, and his character seems fully alive as a self-absorbed, witty, arrogant, and super-intelligent jerk of a superhero who knows his own life is about to end. This character is as much of a reason to watch the movie as anything. There is no attempt to hide the fact that much of the plot and its developments are based on pure technobabble -- a new element is discovered with suspicious ease, computer systems can be commandeered with only a few taps, &c. -- but these are not terribly insulting when left out in the open, and they do not interfere with the political caste that keeps the action story moving. Towards the end things become a little less thoughtful and it becomes harder to invest without a grounding in how the rules work for the new technologies that have been introduced, but it never descends to dullness. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson do well in their roles but those roles, while significant, are never explained or fleshed out much, and they sometimes seem to be there largely to look impressive each in their own way. Gwyneth Paltrow extends the cast of all-stars with a good performance as Pepper Pots, though she seems a little stuck on the note of ""beleaguered."" It's a nice surprise to see Garry Shandling show up as a fun comic-relief senator. This was great entertainment and well ahead of a standard issue genre action or superhero adaptation picture, served effective and real wit, good dramatic sub-plotting, and an extremely memorable lead performance from Downey that does a huge amount to make some scenes that would otherwise be laughably absurd very believable.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","HrutkaPal","5 May 2010","This movie was absolutely terrible. Seriously, everyone involved(except Rourke) should be ashamed. I don't know what was the worst thing: -Starks annoying love for himself, which was good in part 1, but here it was over the top. -The even more annoying Paltrow character, which just wouldn't shut up for one second -The fact, that the movie had a ridicilously flat story, which is close to not existing -Or all those wannabe side-characters which had almost no role at all, and were just in to provide some big names to the castAfter like 20 minutes it was pretty obvious for me, that this movie is gonna suck. But I thought, hey, maybe the actions scenes could spice things up a bit. But not even those were really entertaining. The ONLY part, where I thought that it might become interesting, was where all those robots showed up, and they were outnumbered. Cool. What happened? They killed them in like 30 seconds. What a joke.Rourke's character was the only thing that was a plus.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","liggins14","10 May 2010","I really don't understand what people were expecting, looking at some of the negative reviews. This sequel gives you everything that was great about the first film and then some. Better action, more humor, more characters, and more Easter eggs leading into the Avengers movie. It delves further into Tony Stark's character, showing that his arrogant public persona is a ruse...behind the scenes, he's scared to death because the artificial heart he created is slowly poisoning him to death. He begins drinking heavily, which is leading up to a ""Demon in a Bottle"" sequel; comic book fans know that I'm talking about a key Iron Man story line that helped define the character. I loved Scarlett Johansen as the Black Widow...her one action scene was awesome. The two major Iron Man/War Machine fight scenes beat the action sequences in the first film. The final scene was much better the first movie's finale. I can't wait to see Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers movies!","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","AngelHonesty","8 August 2023","The first movie stands in your mind, its something you walk away with remembering, because its a great movie. And Iron man is awesome. Everytime I watch Iron man part two, I'm like, what was it about again? It's not a bad movie, but its not a great one either.This was the first film that the Black Widow is introduced. She's one of my favorite characters from the avengers. I love how they put her in the movie, its very subtle and yet she stands out at the same time. Its great that we have the original cast back, except Terrence Howard as James Rhodes. He was replaced with Don Cheadle. I normally like Cheadle but after seeing the way Terrence Howard played the role, I did like Cheadle as James Rhodes. He came off cold and didn't have the same chemistry that Terrence had. It felt like they were strangers instead of best friends. The action was great, and I really liked Whiplash. He was down right cool with the whips. But the character of Justin Hammer played by Sam Rockwell didn't fit right for me. It almost would have been better if he wasn't even apart of the story or if his character was written different. The movie felt lacking in action and the last final fight could have been longer or spread out more. And they did not show enough of Pepper Potts and Howard Stark. I honestly find their relationship a little confusing in the movie. Are they still friends? Are they more than that? It felt like the scenes with them were randomly thrown in instead of carefully crafted. The script for Pepper was very different then the first movie, she almost seemed like a different person. I think the biggest downfall to the movie is the over simplified plot. And the clunky connection between the cast. Its missing heart.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","vithiet","7 May 2021","I remember back when it came out I really thought it would be disappointing, as most sequels to movies I love tend to be. I am glad I was proven wrong.

The only downside is the lackluster antagonist, which is a shame considering I really like Mickey Rourke.","1/10"

"Iron Man 2","Zac_La_Porte","3 September 2022","This sci-fi action sequel with big effects, armour and weaponry is worth the time and money of someone who absolutely loved the first Iron Man movie, but this movie doesn't have any brighter or better ideas than the first. There's lots of things in this movie that are top-notch, including the occasional amount of humour, the action, villains, heroes and thematic ideas throughout. But just don't expect it to beat the first film, which was very enjoyable.Iron Man 2 succeeds in some of the most important things that superhero action and sci-fi movies truly need, beginning in a very promising an entertaining first act that settles us into the plot, which is Tony Stark facing pressure by the government to share his weapons with the world while battling a new enemy, Whiplash, played by Mickey Rourke. The antagonist of the film is honestly very good, with his motive being extremely appealing as he is trying to defeat Iron Man to prove that the hero's armour and weapons can be destroyed.The action sequences, especially the prolonged one during the last act, are very well-done, with multiple special effects and stylish moves portrayed by characters. Most people who don't enjoy the Marvel movies or sci-fi superhero action flicks will find that this movie simply isn't their taste when it comes to the genre, which some will have adored the first Iron Man. Unfortunately for some, this sequel is messy and boring, with unnecessary moments and the pacing becoming flat before the climax.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","10/10"

"Iron Man 2","barrys82","24 July 2010","Iron Man 2 left me a very pleasant taste. Maybe it doesn't have the same amount of action than the first one but it is compensated with better CGI, a better developed plot and a more interesting story. Billionaire Tony Stark must contend with deadly issues involving the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies due to his superhero alter ego Iron Man. As I say before, this sequel isn't full of action like the first one but in my opinion it has enough to leave you satisfied and entertained. It also has good moments of humor specially from Robert Downey Jr. The cast is excellent, and practically the same of the first one with the addition of Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Black Widow and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vankov/Whiplash and the substitution of Terence Howard with Don Cheadle as Rhodey, in fact I think that with Cheadle the movie gains in acting . Downey is again perfect as Tony Stark/Iron Man, it is a role made for him. Gwyneth Paltrow is good enough as Pepper Potts and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Nick Fury. In conclusion, Iron Man isn't as exciting as the first one but it has everything to be a total summer blockbuster and pleased the viewer. Oh and one more thing be sure to stay at the end of the final credits to watch a very good surprise.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","mohamed-auc","7 August 2010","I can't believe I actually paid money to watch this horrible thing!! The movie has nothing to see, no plot, no character development and no realism at all!! (SPOILERS) The movie is basically about a super awesome guy with a tin armor, who is a very wealthy, very sexy, very cool, can hack any computer in seconds, brought world peace with his ""tin"" armor. The story continues when you see that he is also a genius scientist who discovered or created a new element in about 15 minutes!!It gets better when you see the all bad a** guy/scientist also who drinks vodka all day and loves his parrot!! a scientist whose body is all covered by tattoos and looks like a thug.Bottom line, if you want to waste your time, at least waste it more decently, there are a lot of retarded movies way better and realistic than this one. It makes me sad that these kind of movies are funded and produced in Hollywood.","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","bluesman-20","14 May 2010","Iron Man 2 starts off where the first one left off and hits the ground running from there. Tony Stark is a national icon Iron Man is seen by a grateful American public as a protector. The government sees the armour as a weapon of mass power that should not be in the hands of just one man. Then there is Justin Hammer a Business rival of Tony Stark's who is obsessed with creating his own Iron Man armour and mass producing it. the Trouble is this the tech used for Iron Man is so superior to anything out there that Stark figures it will take at least twenty years to create an armour like his. Tony is living large and hiding a tragic secret but on top of all of that comes Ivan Vanko or Whiplash armed with tech. Dangerously close to Starks Vanko wants revenge . plus there is betrayal spy work and of course the Black widow wonderfully played by Scarlett Johansson and the ever gruff super spy tough guy legend Nick Fury played by the one and only Sam.L.Jackson. The movie moves at a rocket pace and delivers the acting is solid the story is strong and the story ties up all the loose ends plus gives us more Iron Man and the introduction of War Machine Tony's best friend and fellow crime fighter. Mickey Rouke carries his part with cold sinister menace he and RDJ are the movie and you won't take your eyes off of them. Worth seeing ? YES!","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","SilverDiamond1987","10 May 2010","Iron Man 2 focuses on humor, rather than action or excitement and this causes the movie to be mild. Iron Man 2 is entertaining, but entertainment comes from humor most of the time. Therefore, Iron Man 2 is more like a Saturday show, a Saturday night entertainment than an exciting super hero movie which has a lot of action. Probably it is because the director, Jon Favreau is a director who made comedy movies like Elf or Zathura and the screen writer is the writer of Tropic Thunder, then much (sometimes too much) humor is inevitable. This is what Iron Man 2 has. In addition, the execution and the story were better in the first installment. However, there is a more interesting villain played by great Mickey Rourke (even if even this character is mostly passive throughout) The villain of the first movie was a businessman as known. There are some great visuals, War Machine played by Don Cheadle is included in the team, there are nice cameos like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson is really sexy. There are a few real wow moments and most of them are in The Grand Prix scene. It was the best scene of the movie to me. It could have been longer, but it is definitely satisfying. However, till the final part, you have to wait, if you want to see action. Probably, directors have started to believe that in an action movie, if there is less action, but more drama, the movie becomes more deep and more serious. Some people call this as Spider-Man 3 syndrome. Iron Man 2 suffers from this syndrome at times, in the middle part of the movie. It makes us feel like we watch a comedy drama and this is not surprising, because as I mentioned, the director of the movie is Jon Favreau who made comedy movies, played in comedy movies and the script writer of the movie is Justin Theroux who wrote a comedy before, Tropic Thunder. As for the characters, Robert Downey Junior is again the star of the movie, but he was more funny, cool and witty in the first movie. Natasha Romanoff played by Scarlett Johannson is passive most of the time, the operation scene was entertaining, but it is sad that this character consists of a few showy acts. Ivan Vanko (Rourke) is not a wasted character like Natasha Romanoff, but mostly he sits down and masterminds the chaos. Then, he is included in a disappointing and too short final fight (a few minutes) It starts and finishes in a trice. There are three action parts in the movie. The first one is The Grand Prix scene, in the second one, Iron Man and War Machine are included in a chaos (pretty long) and the third one is the final fight. As a result, Iron Man is very humorous at times, entertaining at times, otherwise disappointing.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","Chiron1987","10 June 2010","There are two saving graces in ""Iron Man 2."" The first is Gwyneth Paltrow's wondrous performance as Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts. Paltrow is literally stunning as Pepper and brings a warmth and depth to this character in a beautiful way.The second is the ""Easter egg"" scene after the end credits in which we see S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Coulson discover the mighty Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, in a crater in New Mexico.That's pretty much it.""Iron Man 2"" is boring, trite, and does nothing for the character or this franchise in any meaningful way. Even the battle scenes were not entertaining. Whereas ""Iron Man"" was fun and exciting and interesting, ""2"" is the exact opposite and even borders on ""Batman & Robin"" embarrassing at times, which is pretty terrible.I had low expectations for ""Iron Man 2"" whenever I saw the first trailer for the film, and it's safe to say that it exceeded (or whatever the opposite of ""exceed"" is) them in spades.I can only hope that the ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" and ""The Avengers"" films are better.

"Iron Man 2","son_of_cheese_messiah","4 May 2010","The old saying too many cooks spoil the broth springs to mind. Here there are too many plot elements and redundant characters. Mickey Rourke looks impressive but, like everything else here, is wasted in a film which tries to cram too much in. Whiplash, Black Widow, Nick Fury, Justin Hammer, War Machine are all quickly introduced and then scantly used. The first fight at the race track between Whiplash and Stark is the highlight but could have been so much better. For instance, we see Pepper Potts driving to deliver Iron Man's armour to him in the opposite direction to the race cars. This could have been an exhilarating scene worth of The French Connection, but not much is made of it. It is not well explained what Whiplash has against Stark. Then comes Hammer, a dull corporate villain very similar to the dull corporate villain in the first film. Why can't Hollywood get beyond these off the peg evil capitalists? A fight with another Iron Man. Some secret agents. Then more Iron men. A lot of gimmicky effects. Nothing we haven't seen many times before.","9/10"

Although not a disaster the second film doesn't quite live up to the first film.The story revolves around the government wanting to have the technology of the Iron Man from Tony Stark. Stark is holding onto the information and says nobody will be able to mimic this for many years. There's no surprises to find that this doesn't turn out to be true.Downey Jr is again pretty entertaining as Stark and Mickey Rourke is also pretty good as Ivan Vanko. It sounds like Johansson and Paltrow didn't get on that well, but there's not too much evidence of that on screen which is slightly disappointing.","8/10"

Now comes Iron man 2 two years later my expectations for this film was high and it lived up to them from the opening sequence to the end,one scene that I thought was great and emotional at the same was the party scene when Tony get's drunk and starts to terrorize his guest's I hated seeing Tony like although I must admit when Rhodes come's to fight him that's where things go from serious to funny,with a nice little mix from Dj Am,whose appearance was welcomed.Iron man 2 is not your typical superhero film instead it does something different.When we finally see Warmachine in all his glory he's bad ass,Ivan Vanko is an awesome villain his presence was great,the acting in the movie was top notch,and Robert does another great job.Jon Faveru does a great job at directing and I hope he returns for another one,and stay after the credits,I'm giving this movie a 10/10 it's a perfect way to kick off the summer.","8/10"

It had a good mix between comedy, dialog, and action, though I think it could have taken a small bit from the dialog and add it to the other two parts.Something I have noticed about Iron Man 1 and 2 is that both movies were setting up something. During most of Iron Man 1, they were setting up the Iron Man story; they were giving Iron Man's back story. That makes sense, to explain where the hero came from. So when I went to see Iron Man 2, I expected it to jump right into things, but by the end of the movie, I realized it was setting up some more. (1st of two spoilers) At the end of the first movie, after the credits their was Nick Fury, from SHIELD, wanting to talk about the Avengers. Okay reference to the avengers, that is cool and all. Then when the second movie came, Nick Fury played a bigger part, and you slowly realize that Iron Man 2 is slowly setting it's way up to the Avengers movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie is not trying to drown us in Avengers references and scenes. There really are only two or three scenes talking about the Avengers, and a few clever references (a certain shield belonging to a certain super hero) and that is about it. The thing is that all of Tony Stark's progression as a character in this movie, is to guide him to being a part of the Avengers. (2nd of two spoilers) And the end of the second movie, after the credits, you see a guy from SHIELD in New Mexico, and they find ""something"" and you see Thor's hammer, which is going to be the next movie in the series.So though it is a good movie, and made my inner nerd freak when I saw Thor's hammer, I am starting to feel iffy about the Avengers Movie, whenever it comes out in a few years. They still need to do Thor, Captain America, and Ant Man, and then the Avengers. Will the last three movies just be set ups as well? And when we do finally reach the Avengers movie, will it be as amazing as all the sets up make it seem?That is a question that only time will answer. I still recommend seeing this movie, if you are a comic book fan, or even just an average movie fan.","10/10"

"Iron Man 2","kotrynamacca","16 May 2010","I gotta say, Robert Downey Jr. is the best actor I've ever seen! He beats out greats like Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt. He never ceases to impress and woo. Every movie he is in, he always steals the spotlight. Robert is perfect in any role he plays. He has got to be the most charismatic guy on the planet. AND the best looking! Yes, his handsomeness is on great display in this amazing film! Now, getting to Iron Man 2, it triples the magic of the first one! The script (and some hilarious obvious ad-libs by Robert Downey Jr.), the plot, the acting, the casting, the chemistry amongst the actors, the directing, the effects, the sets, the messages- PERFECT. PLUPERFECT.The comedy, the drama, the action, the themes, the FUN! My oh my, this movie was something a sequel never is- better than the first! First off, I LOVED the first Iron Man- absolutely adored the film. I had high expectations for Iron Man 2, but I thought it would be impossible to make the sequel any better than the fantastic start to a franchise was. But, I was wrong! Iron Man 2 is 10 times better than the first, if that's even possible! Honestly, I think everyone in the world should see this movie. I'm a big movie buff, and I say this only about the films I truly love. The plot was more complex this time with more subplots to add to the fantastic story. This is nothing like your regular superhero movie. This isn't Batman, Spiderman, or Superman. This is as realistic as it gets. This is something that could truly happen in real life, especially nowadays. It very much applies to modern times and modern problems. This is a very realistic man dealing with very realistic problems. By the way, Tony Stark wasn't that narcissistic at all, even though many people seem to say he was. RDJ portrayed him as truly likable with real emotion, charm, and on-the-dot comic timing. A real-world hero. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark will go down in history as one of the big screen's most memorable characters. This movie kept the audience laughing throughout with the superb witty dialogue and many intentionally hilarious scenes laced with intelligent humor. The movie had some truly emotional and serious scenes, courtesy of the great talent of Robert Downey Jr. It is art. It is pure charm on display for all to see. It is a gift. It is true talent and ability to sway the emotions of the viewers. Robert is my hero- in more ways than one. As a woman, I am so happy a man so ideal actually exists! Is he peerless? Quite possibly!The serious undertones of this action-packed intelligent comedy give the movie its edge. The fact that this movie very much applies to the real world is very appealing. The Avengers is next, but that will contain the unrealistic superheroes like Thor and Hulk, which belong with Spiderman and Superman...that won't be the same...the Iron Man franchise is the real superhero franchise- not a kids' make-believe one. Iron Man 1 and 2 have such great charm and that real-world quality that are not present in the Batman franchises, the Spiderman franchise, the Superman franchise, the Hulk movies, and all the other superhero films. Iron Man 2 is unmatched in its strength as true coolness and top-notch entertainment. It is so smartly written and performed that it makes me truly proud of Hollywood. Thanks to RDJ and Jon Favreau! I am more than pleased with Iron Man 2. I am beyond blown away. It's worth every penny to go and see it! I'm going to see it for a third time next weekend!This film is eye-candy, brain-candy, and heart-candy!","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","lancelong777","7 May 2010","It is 111 if you are not using spaces. This movies was without question the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. And, I invited my friend to come with me since he doesn't go to the movies often and now he is mad at me because he hated it also. Now, don't get me wrong, I am thoroughly an Iron Man fan and read the comic most of my young life. But I think the movie was a movie designed to further the franchise. The setup for the Avengers is now strongly in place as they spent a very large part of the movie harping the Avengers. It took almost two hours before we even get to see the suit do anything worth watching. They spent more time showcasing Scarlet fighting than they did with Iron Man. Robert Downey also proves that he just gets more irritating as he gets older. That and whoever said Jon Favreau and Gwynneth Paltrow are stars should be put on trial. The four main characters just do not go together and the fact that they took out the best performer from the first one - Terence, is quite sad. I like Don Cheadle as much as the next guy but he doesn't even come close to making Rhodes believable. This movie has taken a terrible step back and should not be seen by anyone.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","keithdawkins","30 April 2010","This film is exactly as you would expect a large budget Marvel film to be, big names, big effects and big fun. You'll leave wanting to don the suit and save the world. Good performance from Mickey Rourke again, he is making the silent type baddie a niche all of his own.The special effects are great, reminiscent of Minority Report in places but version 2.0! Eye candy and some kick ass moves provided by Scarlett Johannsen, some excellent one liners from all the cast, explosions a plenty, far out James Bond gadgetry and the introduction of Mr cool himself, Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury, all add up to a fun night out.If you want to ""pick holes"", go ahead you'll have a field day, however if you want a good night out go and see the movie, you wont be disappointed.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","SebaZava","1 May 2010","Put simply, Iron Man 2 is the best film I've seen so far this year. That doesn't mean no movie released this year can be better than Jon Favreau's masterpiece of a comic book film, but I certainly don't think any potential blockbuster this year will be as funny, exciting, well- developed and brilliantly acted. As hard as it may be to imagine, Iron Man 2 is even better than the original movie - and, you know, the first part was, along with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, one of the best comic book films ever made. It does almost nothing wrong, and while it isn't 100% brilliant all the way, it's as good as any ""traditional"" comic book adaptation can be. (The Dark Knight being a ""non-traditional"" adaptation.)The story is a little more convoluted than in the first movie, but fortunately director Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) don't make the same mistakes Sam Raimi made with Spider-Man 3. Sure, there is more than one villain, but the only ""active"" villain is Ivan Vanko; Justin Hummer is more of an instrument, and is not a classic villain in the sense that he is neither intimidating nor particularly dangerous. He only has the ""resources.""Those who have seen the first installment might have noticed that, while the movie was excellently-written and acted, it kind-of-suffered during its climax because of some weak action. Well, this certainly isn't the problem here, since Iron Man 2 provides with some of the best action you'll see this year. Unlike, you know, a film like Transformers 2, the machine-on- machine battles in Iron Man 2 are actually exciting and tense because we know there are people behind those suits; because those people have been well-developed throughout two movies, and because Favreau, unlike Michael Bay, doesn't feel the need to shake the camera as much as possible and cutting every millisecond while shooting an action sequence.Performances, much like in the previous film, are absolutely perfect. Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, there is no doubt about it, and even in the film's weakest scenes - which are very few -, Downey makes the movie work. This time around, Stark is dying - the substance that makes the suit work and keeps him alive is actually killing him - and Downey Jr. now portrays Stark not only as a charismatic playboy, but also as a somewhat deeper character, who resorts to alcoholism because of all his problems. This alcoholism is not the main point of the film, though - it certainly is addressed, but it's something that gets dismissed rather quickly. This is for the better, I believe - even more problems and another sub-plot would have only hurt the film, and I'm sure the filmmakers will be able to explore this characteristic of Tony Stark in a deeper manner in subsequent films.Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard from the previous movie, is effective as Jim Rhodes. (He's even got some great one-liners.) Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, and her relationship with Tony manages to move forward a little. There's great chemistry between the two of them, and they've got some great scenes together. Mickey Rourke is just great as Ivan Vanko - the majority of his dialogue is in Russian, and although he isn't precisely three- dimensional, we know just enough about the characters for him to remain both (a little) mysterious and intimidating. Sam Rockwell is also delightful as Justin Hammer - a very coward and unlikeable characters, that's for sure, but Rockwell manages not to turn him into a caricature. Scarlett Johansson, on the other hand, is just superb as agent Natasha Romanoff. With this part not only does she prove that she's the sexiest, most beautiful actress alive - one just has to hear men's reaction in the theatre whenever she appeared on- screen -, but also that she may be able to hand an entire action film by herself. She was just... *sigh*... amazing.So is the film perfect? Not really, but its faults are small enough for them not to hurt he overall quality of the picture. Still, while the John Debney's score wasn't particularly awful or bothersome, it simply was... mediocre. There's nothing memorable or outstanding about his music. It's just... there. Completely forgettable. On the other hand, while I certainly was excited about the presence of a couple of AC/DC songs (Shoot to Thrill and Highway to Hell), I expected more of them, at least three or four, not just two! I mean, there's a reason why the film's soundtrack is made up entirely of AC/DC songs right? (I already bought it, by the way, and it's a nice re-collection of classic songs.) For example, if you know AC/DC has a song called War Machine and one of the characters in your movie is called ""War Machine""... wouldn't it be logical for you to put that song in the film? Hopefully they're saving it for the next installment or something.Anyway, those faults aren't particularly big, and the film as a whole is just amazing. It had been some time since I last left the theatre so excited. I mean, I am studying film-making, and when I left the theatre after watching Iron Man 2 I just thought ""this is the kind of film I want to make."" And by that I don't mean a superhero movie necessarily... I mean a film that does so many things correctly: it's laugh-out-loud hilarious at times, but it's also incredibly exciting. It's got some amazing special effects, interesting and believable characters, great performances, a complex but effective plot and it even works as a set up for a bigger universe of superheroes. Once again, Iron Man 2 is the best film I've seen this year so far, and I just can't imagine any blockbuster being more successful. I'm definitely seeing it again a couple of times in theatres... yes, it's that good.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","Saudade777","9 May 2010","I don't normally write reviews, but I had to after seeing some of the Critic reviews. I am a huge, huge comic book fan. Have been since I was 7. Iron Man caught me off guard. I was always loved the 'Avengers' (Marvel comics always beat DC in my world), but Iron Man was never one of my favourite characters, but the first movie was right up there with Batman Begins, Spiderman 2, and X-Men 2. For me Iron Man 2 is in that league. This movie was funny, tons of action, great characters, wonderful ideas with subtle touches. I'm not going into the plot or give spoilers.All I want to say is this movie was darn fun and a great summer movie.Please trust me on this one.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","The_Daemon","10 May 2010","A delightful banter heavy super-hero film in which the emphasis of the film is clearly put on the character of the film and less so on the super-heroic exploits and trials that comic-based films generally focus upon. The diminished focus on action pieces might threaten to bog the picture down but the character interactions and their barbed-filled vocal exchanges keep the film moving along at a clean pace until the inevitable CG heavy battle scenes.Not that there is a lack of money spent in terms of CG wizardry on the screen. But instead of merely focusing their efforts on the suit battles, the film is littered with highly detailed sets and the constant use of extremely high-tech holographic touch sensitive technology is all pervasive. Not to diminish the skirmishes involving the Iron Man suit though as they are fun to watch, very smoothly executed and very aesthetically pleasing especially Micky Rourke's frankensteined creation clashing with Tony Stark's ultra-slick technology.The plot itself treads no particular new ground although it does attempt to through in a great many sub-plots and personal dilemmas for the ample cast of characters to deal with. The problem with most of these dilemmas is that they generate very little serious drama as they are mainly dealt with in either a succinct manner or are treated in a rather glib fashion and things just sort of seem to work themselves out almost accidentally due to the increased amount of events and characters involved basically just diluting the situation to the point that it almost seems an afterthought when it is reconciled. This casual dismissive tone carries over to the antagonists as the film spreads itself out a little too thin to the point that what should have been powerful character conflicts involving the major characters just seem like minor scuffles.There is also the odd sort of underlying theme of a stereo-typical conservative American approach to the way in which the film idolizes weaponry and pushes the agenda that America possessing the most powerful weapon in the world would undoubtedly result in an increase in world peace. Then there's also the extra step the film takes that Americans apparently feel more comfortable in having a shallow, fun-loving, but seemingly trust worthy private individual in possession of the most powerful weapon in the world but not their own government.Is the writer trying to make a statement about the current mental state of American with the increase in paranoia and private militias or is it just more poorly thought out Hollywood worship of the Dirty Harry one man army character doing things we are afraid to take responsibility for? The film makes an attempt to explore the folly of this approach by the sudden attack of Ivan Vanko utilizing similar technology that supposedly was beyond the reach of the rest of the world as promised by Stark. This is then further compounded by a frustrated military friend being able to utilize one of the suits which seems improbable considering the vast amount of hack proof machinery that Stark regularly employs. But like with most issues in Iron Man these are just brushed aside or ignored in the face of an impending threat and we are left wondering what became of all that anyways? But despite all these faults I found the film infectiously enjoyable. Despite the fact that many characters aren't utilized to their fullest, they are immediately compelling and a joy to watch when they are on the screen. Micky Roarke is incredibly fun to watch as he is both a brutal thug and a introverted technology wizard who is only truly friendly to his father and his bird. Tony's relationship with his ambiguously defined girlfriend Pepper Potts is very engaging and their constant over-lapping dialogue exchanges were genuinely funny and wholly natural. Of course most of this has to do with Robert Downey Jr.'s great acting abilities and he really elevates the quality of the movie with his level of skill.Despite the intensely glib tone of the movie I found the whole thing very enjoyable. There's nothing new here to be sure, but the abilities of everyone involved elevate the movie as a whole into a very satisfying experience.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","helmutty","1 May 2010","I can't say that this is better or worse than first one. One thing that Iron Man 2 is better than the first one is the action scenes. There are more robots to robots clashing in this one although they are a bit short and do not provide enough thrills. One thing Iron Man 2 does not have in the first one is the intensity of the story. This time, the story is not so fast, and in the middle, it drags. Jon the director tries to inject drama into this but in the end, it pulls the fast pace into a slower one. I am not saying it is bad but it just does not put justice to the first one which has a fun pace.The story: Like I said, this cannot be compared to the first, in fact. Since, Tony is back and he has bigger problems to deal including a villain. The first third of the movie is energetic including WhipSplash known as Ivan in a car racing scene. The second third of the movie is where the pace goes slower for Tony to deal with his personal problems and that gives time to Ivan to build robots. The last third is where Tony thankfully solves his major problem and prepares to suit up for the climax. It may not have the energy like the first one but it is still fun with new characters. John Debney,who replaces Ramin, creates an epic score for this one.Overall: It still entertains and has a lot of fun. I would say it is certainly a good sequel to the first while it is not comparable. This may be the only movie for your thirst of superheroes movies unless you count Jonah Hex in. This better makes good in box office to have a another sequel.","2/10"
"Iron Man 2","rooee","5 May 2010","Watching Iron Man 2 is kind of like observing a largely bloodless car crash while someone provides amusing narration. The plot is a wheeling mess, but the film is rescued by a lively, screwball script and some sharp improvisation from an ensemble of talented performers. Least amongst them is Mickey Rourke as the vengeful Ivan Vanko, in a performance that belongs to a far darker movie. Indeed, his scenes highlight the film's frequent lurches from breezy to black, which, combined with an apparent explosion at the on-set minor character-making factory, create an experience far less satisfying than its simple-minded predecessor – which itself was an ideal response to the ""darkening"" of comic book adaptations brought about by the Nolan brothers.This sequel is best when it focuses on verbal sparring. Because, while Favreau is a competent director, he has people scenes and CGI scenes; he hasn't the skill of Jackson, Cameron or Spielberg at blending the human and the virtual. This leads, after some mecha gunplay straight out of Halo, to a disappointingly perfunctory final confrontation.After it's all over, one is left scratching one's head. What was the purpose of Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), besides laying multiple beds for multiple sequels? Why did Rhodes (Don Cheadle) overreact so dramatically at Stark's (Robert Downey Jr) birthday party? Was their ensuing bromantic tussle the sole trigger for Rhodes' subsequent robo-larceny? It all amounts to an overlong, overcomplicated, occasionally enjoyable disaster.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","wibiyana","14 May 2010","I watched IRONMAN2 about two days ago, and I kind of loved it =D, better than the first one, because here Tony Stark went crazier and more unstoppable hahah. Well,, I think here, Robert Downey Jr. didn't act at all, I meant he's definitely Tony Stark, Tony Stark is him! so, no wonder if his performance is really that cool =P, CZ its not about plays somebody Else's character but your own character, just as easy as you to be yourself, although I know that sometimes its kinda difficult to be yourself. But here I am saying that Tony Stark or Ironman is definitely Downey Jr., the genius and crazy, sexy guy hahahah. OK, its enough time to screw around, actually for me, they brought us a new, different paradigm, both Favreau and Downey, different one of a superhero in a witty way of funny and sometimes unpredictable story, and it'll makes you just like ""oh my, cant wait for the next sequel"" or ""damn, he's cool as hell, I love Ironman, I love Tony Stark!"".hmhh..., I liked the Tony's experiment room mostly, man, I absolutely down on my jaws about three meters to the edge of the white screen on the theater 3, when I was watching this movie. often enough I, imagining myself doing something on that room, designing, filming...(if only the room exist) lol. Not just it, I was like WOW by Scarlett, the melodramatic actress acted surprisingly awesome as a secret agent, she even did some action maneuvers, hahaha, pretty magnificent, good job scar-jo! and the Ironman's enemy, Ivan vanko, has a good acting as a god damn terrible freaky smart and ambitious, Russian ...umh,well, can I say ""scientist!?"" and guys, I love his Russian accent, simply stunning =)the one really makes this movie lame, is the kissing scene (tony and pepper) ugh, they should throw away that scene, moreover it was in the almost ending of this movie, oh my..., it was almost destroy the whole this beautifully funny movie, I hate pepper, Paltrow kinda overacting I think..., just easy mom -__-"", she should be replaced by Cate Winslett or Julia Roberts, I think they would be more suit with Stark hehehehe...But overall, I love and enjoy this movie, the actor (Downey), the actress (scar-jo) and the music, especially when tony and Rhodes changed the party hall on Tony's house into a battlefield! will be good to see this even as trilogy or tetra-logy, penta-logy maybe *grin*","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","mahmus","18 August 2020","Perhaps it's because, unlike most MCU films, it feels like characters are just living in this universe. They're not driven by plot or action, they're just caught up in the obstacles that come with living in a world of superheroes, even if Marvel was clearly still trying to figure out what that world would be like.It's cool to see these characters just living their lives and dealing with their own personal problems while the villains deal with their own somewhere else. It makes for a somewhat uneventful story, but it sets it apart from other entries, both for better and worse.As I mentiones earlier, the MCU was still very undefined. The introduction of Nick Fury (as more than a cameo) and Black Widow isn't the first attempt to expand the world of the movie beyond its central hero (The Incredible Hulk had a Tony Stark cameo and the Super soilder serum played a big part in the plot), but it is the first time they had the main hero interact with this wider world, and while it's definitely not done as gracefuly as in later films, it does makes the universe feel lived in.Also, while I think that Scarlett Johansson is great as Black Widow (and that she's great here), she was definitely not as confident in the role as she would be in later films.Overall, it's a step down from the first one, but one that I still ejoy quite a lot.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","boothstr96","8 May 2010","The thing that is so hard to do in films is to make your content convincing. This is why so many other films fail. Favreau does not fail. I was worried going into Iron Man 2 that it wasn't going to live up to its hype and its prequel. But it did. The only criticism I have is that it is a bit slow for its type of movie. However, the content within the slower scenes is often filled with witty dialogue, low-key visual spectacles, and some confusing concepts. What I'm trying to get at is that Iron Man's audience is typically smaller children, and for them, I would say this movie is going to be a bit boring, for it lacks in the action department for the most part. But what may be its downfall box-office-wise is also its greatest accomplishment. Much like the Dark Knight, Iron Man 2 takes the superhero world and not-cheesily but convincingly conveys what it would be like in today's world. Not to mention we actually see Tony Stark go through a hero cycle in this one, without taking away his compulsive and loud personality. All in all, Iron MAn's long awaited release was worth it in my eyes. It was a perfect movie to kick off the Summer hype films and it makes me eager to watch what else Favreau has planned for the franchise.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","welhof1","17 November 2021","Nothing super new here but more action and they did a good job. The main villain was pretty cool. I liked his whips. Also the villain Hammer was annoying but I liked him. I watch these iron man movies for the suit and this sequel did not disappoint.I will say the romance between stark and Potts is a little awkward. That role just doesn't seem to be for her and she's not a great actress.","1/10"
"Iron Man 2","Al_The_Strange","6 May 2015","In the first Iron Man film, we saw an arms manufacturer develop a conscience and become a hero trying to clean up the mess his company left behind. A follow-up was inevitable, and Iron Man 2 would continue to track Tony Stark's moral journey through even more highs and lows.Among the high points of the film, Iron Man confronts a new villain that pops up out of the blue, who trashes some race cars and sends them flying down the track. The film's climax pits Iron Man against a whole contingent of drones, before Iron Man and War Machine team up in an explosive all-out fighting sequence. All this action is really cool, but the film still dishes out plenty of amusing banter and interesting thematic material to keep everything even.Unfortunately, the film suffers a few low points. In spite of the dramatic issues the film tackles, the pacing is not always perfect; scenes in-between the action can be a hit-or-a-miss. This is because the film juggles a lot of different things in its plot. It is notable how the film continues to track Tony Stark's growth, for even though he embraced a new identity as a hero, he still has his ego to contend with, and it gets him into all kinds of trouble in this film. These scenes do dig up significant levels of conflict, and ultimately, it presents a compelling account of how Tony's obsession with technology and fame gradually erodes his soul and isolates him from the people around him. However, the film also tosses in other random elements - including a Russian bad guy who has no real relevance to the story's main conflicts, and some random scenes with Black Widow and Nick Fury that only serve to whet audiences' appetites for 2012's Avengers. In spite of these haphazard plot points, the film doesn't necessarily congeal well, making for a rather uneven story.Fortunately, the film looks good, with decent photography and editing. Robert Downey Jr. continues to excel as the main character, while Gweneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, and Samuel L. Jackson are all fun to watch. Mickey Rourke has some cheesy parts (especially with his ""I vant my boid"" line), but I think he's good most of the time. Writing is okay, but probably could have used more refinement. This production features good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. John Debney's music score is pretty awesome.Iron Man 2 is decently-entertaining and its story has a few significant points to make, but it is rather mixed, and it has led many viewers to regard it as an inferior sequel. Regardless of its issues, I find the film perfectly enjoyable.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Mixed | Film: Very Good)","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","acedj","24 January 2020","Iron Man 2 takes a deep, dark look at the man behind Iron Man, specifically at his inner demons. We all have them, our specific regrets that make us who we are. Tony thinking his father was never fond of him nor wanted him around. The fact that alcohol becomes a crutch to lean on as he battles the fact that he might be dying, his undying love for a Ms. Pepper Potts. During a car race two new villains appear, one is obvious, Whiplash, one not so much, Justin Hammer. Unbeknownst to Tony some new friends also appear, one Black Widow and the ever present S.H.I.E.L.D. There is a lot going on in this movie, and it probably should have been longer or made into two films. Mickey Rourke was right in that his character was not fully developed, nor was just how ever pervasive Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. are. This is still a great movie. R.D.J. was born to play Tony Stark and that fact shines through. Also, this movie has the best line in all of the MCU, and was probably echoing the thoughts of every man watching the movie; when Tony first meets Natasha (calling herself Natalie here), as she is walking away says, ""I want one"". Yeah Tony we all do.","8/10"

Very little important or memorable or even quotable dialogue.Shoehorned world building.Ugly and without a uniform colour scheme or look, the sets and frames are filled with off colours and other incongruities for no good reason.Drunken suit fight during a party where Iron Man DJs then hits Don Cheadle with a barbell to Another One Bites the Dust. Such crass motivation to start War Machine. The entire sequence makes the suits look small, weak, stupid and fallible. Looks incredible plasticky and fake.Music is some awful Danny Elfman plinky plonky Spider-Man nonsense.Stan Lee cameo review: Old Man confused as Larry King: 5/5. Another belter. I mean he does look like Larry King, it's another confusion gag but Lee's face is not only priceless but it might actually be the only good piece of acting he's ever done.End credits review: 2/5: I remember thinking WTF is this? And then getting on to some serious youtubing. It's teeny tiny but effective. A start to the teasers rather than full scenes. Generic lines plus a thunder clap: Didn't really do it for me.","8/10"

"Iron Man 2","ser-packan","11 May 2010","Great sequel to a great movie. Before i watched this i have read a lot of negative or mixed reviews and had been worrying a little, but now i'm glad it appeared to be much better than it had been described.This sequel is more ""depressive"" and less funny than the first one but it has a more mature look to it. The story develops well and Mickey shows some heavy acting: less words, more action and thinking.Robert Downey falls in the first half of this sequel but gets up after an amazing discovery. His female partners as always charming and play their respective roles but nothing more.All in all it was a great experience and now i want to see the third part.","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","Troy_Campbell","30 April 2010","Sequels are the most difficult movies to get right. Fickle audiences are anticipating more of what they loved in the first flick, but don't want it to become repetitive. On the flipside they also expect it to be fresh and innovative without it feeling like an altogether dissimilar movie from the original. Trying to find that balance is an extremely tricky thing and most don't succeed. Where does IM2 fit in? It's not in the higher echelon of action sequels alongside The Dark Knight or X2, which bettered their predecessors, but it's definitely not far off and that's no easy feat.Justin Theroux's screenplay is crammed with a plethora of plot strands and for the most part – minus a partially neglected Tony / Pepper subplot here and a wasted opportunity with Vanko there – he manages to juggle them quite effectively. The biting social commentary from the initial film is back in addition to the trademark casual humour not seen in other comic book adaptations, however Theroux has expanded the Iron Man franchise with a slightly more light-hearted approach, undoubtedly due to the burgeoning Marvel movie-universe that is currently being formed. Subsequently there's a much stronger focus on the collective Marvel effort to come in the future, thanks to a larger part for Nick Fury (Jackson) and a couple of teasing moments (make sure you stay until the end of the credits) that hint at other characters looming nearby.Returning in the director's seat is the ever-surprising Jon Favreau, once again helming with confidence and flair. His handle on the action set-pieces increasingly gets better, despite a vaguely underwhelming climactic showdown, with the clash at Monaco's F1 Grand Prix and ruckus at Tony's Malibu mansion the highlights. The special effects team greatly aid Favreau as the CGI is practically faultless; the diverse machinery on show is photo-realistic ensuring the fight and flight sequences look amazing. Sans computer effects, a lithe Johansson rumbling with a handful of Hammer's henchmen will have you in awe, not just because of the outfit worn by Johansson but due to the excellent fight choreography and the fact that most of the stunts were performed by the actress herself.Portraying our uniquely cavalier protagonist, Downey Jr exudes charisma and style yet again. His cocky, eccentric exterior becomes a tad monotonous but never reaches a level that decreases his likability. Unexpectedly the cast member that challenges Downey Jr to best on screen is the equally peculiar and compelling Sam Rockwell. He makes what could have been a smarmy, one-dimensional villain into a humorous and engaging tyrant who even manages to outdo Tony in the comedy stakes. Elsewhere Rourke makes for a suitable tattooed Ruskie, Paltrow and Johannson offer sweet and sexy respectively and Cheadle fills the boots left by Terrence Howard gratifyingly. Kudos to Cheadle and the filmmakers for making the 'new' Rhodey's entrance a memorably quick-witted in-joke too; they swiftly dispel the audiences concern of having a different actor in the role.A rousing follow-up that very nearly matches the brilliant first instalment and will leave you keen for more Iron Man, whether in his own movie or not.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","JWick23","28 March 2021","Iron Man 2 has some similiar elements and plot devices to it predecessor. It isn't too drastically changed or amplified to its prequel and that's what I like about it.Solid story with some minor flaws. The beginning and ending were good but the middle was a bit slow and unnecessary. The characters were decent. The antagonist was a good villian and Tony has developed nicely so far. With good music and visuals and with good writing and directing it is definitely worth your time.Overall a semi enjoyable film.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Quiet unlikely..","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","rockyroberts999","22 May 2010","OK....so let me just start by saying, Iron Man 2 is AMAZING!! It's so good, it made me go unconscious for a little while....well almost. I read so many terrible reviews, so I walked in the theater a little skeptical. What I got was incredible though! It was everything I hoped for and nothing I was worried about it. ""Too many AC/DC songs"" and ""too much Burger King"" were 2 things I kept reading about, so I was kept thinking that it was going to be like a cheesy 2 hour music video/Super Bowl commercial. There were 2 AC/DC songs, which were only 30 second clips and fit the scenes they were in, plus I mean, directors like certain bands; just like Scorsese loves the Rolling Stones and puts tons of their tracks in his stuff, apparently Favreau likes AC/DC. Honestly, I didn't see Burger King anywhere in this movie and I can usually spot product placement instantly because it drives me crazy. It was great though is the bottom line. Even the change to Don Cheadle was fine and I loved first line of, ""I'm here, it's me, get over it,"" which obviously had a double-meaning. I loved all of it. Even Scarlett Johansson was good in it. She didn't have very many lines, so her inability to act well wasn't even noticeable, and she was a bad ass with bad ass fight scenes.I dug it, you'll dig it, go see it.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","kdnor2011","18 January 2011","I know I will get a lot of hate for this, but I actually liked this movie more than the first. Now I'm not saying that this film is better than the first, I guess in terms of writing, this is the worst film. However, I had more fun watching this movie. To me, this was the more fun of the two.Now it isn't a perfect film by any means. Pepper Potts wasn't great in the first film, but in this film she seems to have two modes. She's either annoying, or she is a complete idiot. I'm sorry, but if a droid ten feet away from me begins beeping and blinking red, I won't just stand there and look at it, I'm running away as fast as I can. Also, like the first film, there is way more talking then action, in fact there's even less action in this film.However that brings me into the good stuff. While this film has more talking than action, I actually liked the talking. Robert Downey Jr. was hilarious, he always had me smiling. And because of this, despite Stark still being a douche, I liked him a lot more. The film is just full of witty banter. So I liked when there was action and when there wasn't action. And once again my favorite character was Rhodey, once again reminding me of myself. Scarlett Johansen was hot. The two villains made the perfect antagonist. Ivan was intimidating, and Hammer was funny. And I liked the story. It's basically part Iron Man movie, part trailer for the Avengers, and for me it worked.I can't really see why this film was hated by so many people. Sure it has good reviews, and most people seem to like it. But of all the Avengers movies, this one seems to get the most hate. I really enjoyed this movie, it isn't perfect, and the first film is probably a better film, but I enjoyed this movie more.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","andreasilmjarv","26 December 2018","Iron Man 2 isn't as bad of a movie that people say it is, although it isn't great either.
It is one of the weakest movies in the MCU, which was a surprise especially when Iron Man 1 was one of the best MCU movies.Tony stark doesn't have the same motivations and doesn't care if people get hurt, which is completely out of character for him, since he started being a Superhero because he realized how many people his weapons were harming.Not a good movie, watch it only if you really like Robert Downey Jr. Otherwise skip this movie.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","pcongleton-1","20 May 2010","The first Iron Man film seemed more like an action film with a guy in an Iron Man suit than anything else. This film actually felt more like an Iron Man movie and it was a more enjoyable experience. All the usual, excellent cast members, made their appearances. Robert Downey JR. and Gwyneth Paltrow are the returning champs while Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke and Garry Shandling come along for this one. Finally, Scarlett Johansson finds an action role fit for her and it should carry her into Marvel History as the Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff in future film endeavors – I hope. After seeing her in ""The Spirit"" (2008), I was a little worried. Samuel L. Jackson continues his outstanding portrayal of Nick Fury. However, there is a casualty. They still haven't found the right guy for Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. In the last film it was Terrence Howard, who looked the part, but I thought wasn't able to sell it well enough. In fact I laughed at him way too much. This time it hurts, because I like Don Cheadle, but not here. The search continues. The SPFX totally do the job right. There is an excellent introduction in the beginning of the film of our hero to the blaring tunes of AC/DC, that is totally believable and quite exciting. Many of the fight scenes truly give us the feeling that we are seeing a comic-book come to life. What is good about this film is, if you do not know much about Iron Man that does not matter. Anybody will enjoy this one and can follow along with the story. Mickey Rourke adds a nicely acted dimension as the bad guy that Tony Stark's Iron Man has to face. I rather enjoyed this film after having a bad taste in my mouth after watching the first one.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","ringfire211","17 May 2010","Saw IRON MAN 2 over the weekend and thought it was merely okay. Doesn't come close to the original. And I wasn't exactly going crazy about the original one either. The best part was without a doubt the Monaco race track scene where Whiplash makes his entrance. That scene was, in one word, AMAZING!! Probably the greatest entrance of a villain in any superhero movie that I've seen. And the action that follows was equally brilliant! Unfortunately everything else ranged from merely okay to downright baaaad. Tony sitting in a donut was downright cringe-worthy as was Sam Jackson's lame line about exiting the donut. Hardy-harr-harr.. who the heck came up with that one? And the scene where Tony gets drunk and rowdy at the party immediately reminded me of the scene where Peter Parker does the same thing in SPIDER-MAN 3. Yuck!! And I agree with Roger Ebert - the finale was both overwhelming and underwhelming! Overwhelming because of all those hundreds of drones flying around blasting Iron Man with all the firepower they can muster. How the city stayed intact with all those huge fireballs left and right is beyond me. Much less how lucky can one Iron Man get against a slew of such machines. Even by comic-books standards this is really pushing it. But then we get to the showdown we've been waiting for - Iron Man vs. Whiplash! How long does that last? Oh a few measly seconds. Are you kidding me?! How can you create a climax which isn't even 1/4 as great as the racetrack scene. I wish they scrapped all those drones and gave us a proper ending with Iron Man vs. Whiplash. I mean this ending makes the ending in the original one (Iron Man vs. Iron Monger) look like a masterpiece in comparison. And I actually considered THAT one pretty underwhelming - there's just not too much excitement seeing two metal suits clanging against each other.So yeah I thought this one was a considerable drop-off from the first one. The actors were all good (though I still prefer the acting in the first one) and the racetrack scene was superior to anything in the first film but outside of that the story is really uninteresting and bland. And the ending, as I said, was both overwhelming and underwhelming.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","guskeller","28 April 2022","Iron Man 2 is overstuffed, pulling in superfluous directions. It introduces Black Widow (and expands on SHIELD), War Machine, two villains, Stark's degrading health, his father issues, and expands on his complicated relationship with Potts. Had these plotlines been in separate movies, they could've had proper development. Instead, nothing intertwines and the movie is messy. Furthermore, Stark's character doesn't arc. He solves problems, but doesn't grow. In fact, he finishes the movie by mocking his doubters (even though they were right about his technology being a public safety threat). Ultimately, Iron Man 2 only feigns drama around merchandising and action.Technically, Iron Man 2 is a downgrade. Rock music is more sparse, imagery is less dramatic, editing is basic, sound lacks symbolism, and the tone is muddled. The first action sequence is appealing, but the climactic battle is uninspired. Meanwhile, the cast adds several big names, but there's less emotional range for them to explore. Previously, Downey was able to show vulnerabilities that are noticeably missing here. Overall, Iron Man 2 is more like a collection of parts than a cohesive whole. Its individual ideas are interesting, but it's too cluttered to connect. Iron Man 2 is fine entertainment, but it's also a missed opportunity.Writing: 4/10

"Iron Man 2","phd_travel","23 October 2010","Much preferred the first Iron Man. The parts between the action sequences are incredibly dull. None of the characters is really that interesting.I think the story is just way off. There is no onward thrust in the story.The dialog is obscure to say the least when you can understand what they are saying. And what is Stark's problem. The story expects you to understand too much from little hints.Robert Downey Jr needs to speak more slowly and articulate each word.Mickey Rourke is just so bizarre looking.Gwyneth is older looking - her face is drawn but still has a stunning figure.Scarlett is alluring with her dark hair and her action sequence near the end is quite good.

"Iron Man 2","uofmsuperfan12","29 May 2010","The second installment of this Marvel series does not disappoint. Downey Jr. is once again a hit with a stunning performance as the narcissistic Tony Stark. This time around Tony is dealing with a health problem; the same miniature Arc-reactor that is keeping him alive, is also killing him. The metal needed to run the device is poisoning him. Stark starts down a destructive path until helped out by Sam Fury, who surfaced in the after-the-credits spoiler of the first movie, and the drop-dead gorgeous Scarlett Johansson. Don Cheadle enters as the replacement for Terrence Howard as Stark's best bud Jim Rhodes. Mikey Rourke continues his action-movie prowess as the villain and Rhodes and Stark team up as Iron man and War Machine to bring him down. An action-packed thriller, Iron Man 2 keeps all on the edge of their seats.Also of note, fans of the upcoming Avengers movie, based off the Stan Lee superhero team, will enjoy the not-so-subtle look at Captain America's shield and of the after-the-credits allusion to a Thor movie.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","gradyharp","9 October 2010","IRON MAN II. May he rest in peace. As with so many of these Marvel Comics scripts there are so many add-on characters to disrupt the meager storyline that it seems like the studio tapped everyone who walked by the filming, gave them a few lines and a wow costume and said 'come one in.' Rating an obvious millions of dollars production such as this is duplicitous: CGI 5, acting 3, story 1. But if noise, mayhem, and electrical fires are pleasing to you, then by all means jump aboard this colorful film. Robert Downey, Jr. is a fine actor so he puts as much as he can into the lines allotted him to read. Mickey Rourke is the bad guy with even more tattoos and longer hair than the Wrestler, and with a Russian accent to boot. Don Cheadle plays Don Cheadle, and Sam Rockwell needs a shave as a supposed wily bad guy executive. Samuel L. Jackson attempts to lend some dignity. Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be asking why she bothered until Scarlett Johansson jumps on board to give the film some much need punch. It's good guy versus bad guy - with drones create by Rourke's disenchanted character that attempt unsuccessfully to turn the tide. What's missing is some of Robert Downey, Jr.'s comedic banter and the brakes put on the destruction of the Stark Expo concept. Definitely a film for those who like this sort of high volume comic book outing.Grady Harp","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","moviemavens","9 May 2010","""I.privatize.world peace"" sums it all.The novelty of ""Iron Man"" hasn't worn off on me. While it would never be the same as witnessing the first scene of Iron Man soaring into space and the joy of the trial and error, Iron Man is still the only one of its kind that is as grounded in future reality as it could be.Tony Stark is one of the rare exceptions of being a publicly known superhero. And possessing the traits of a superhero, he does not. Robert Downey Jr. doesn't disappoint in the sequel wherein the world knows him not only as the billionaire weapon manufacturer extraordinaire, but more pivotally as The Man in armored suit.RDJ is the brain, heart and soul of Iron Man. It makes me wonder whether the script was written to be specifically tailored to him. Bold and brash, he's got that smug and swagger that commands the world over. Naturally narcissistic and sarcastic, over-sized just doesn't cover it as far as his ego goes. Never known for subtleties, his flashy style and fast-paced lifestyle suits him just fine - even in his quest to discover the new energy source since the arc-core machine that keeps his heart beating is also slowly poisoning his blood.RDJ's personality carries every single scene that he's in. Numerous outrageously riotous one-liners bring on continuous giggles and laugh out-louds. Be it frivolous or witty or sarcastic, Stark goes toe-to-toe with the newly minted CEO of Stark Industries aka love-interest Pepper Pots, newly appointed eye-candy secretary with an ulterior motive aka Black Widow, Hammer the competitor with an ambitiously ambiguous agenda, or Nick Fury from yes, the upcoming Avengers team (sidenote: the geeks in us would notice Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer). Everyone seems to have so much fun and it shows. I don't recall ever laughing so hard for so long in a non-comedic movie! And Whiplash... what an entrance! I totally didn't expect the Monaco mayhem to happen early. With connected past through their fathers, he's a worthy adversary. The Grand Prix thrill of the peril where Whiplash faces off with Stark sans suit is the stealer of the movie (and the manner in which he ends up donning the suit is a real treat), even more so than the last sequence of dash, smash and blast of the battle of the war machines in the end. Although the mass zig-zag laser cut or the armed superobots is the incredible icing on the metal. If there's a ""flaw"" in all these, Don Cheadle as war machine is too flawless to be believable. Not anyone clad in the suit is ""Iron Man."" One might argue that this ""Iron Man"" lacks heart, but I tend to think that it's just as it's supposed to be. ""Iron Man"" doesn't take itself seriously; it's a nonstop joyride starring a wisecracked eccentric atypical superhero, and it deftly delivers.The MovieMaven http://themoviemaven.posterous.com","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","ajs-10","1 May 2010","I very much enjoyed the first film in this series and was hoping for more of the same in the sequel. Fortunately I wasn't too disappointed, it lived up to the first one, maybe not quite as good (sequels seldom are), but a fine effort nonetheless. The setting is New York where Tony Stark, having revealed himself as Iron Man and having brought peace to the world, is holding his Stark Expo, an exhibition of technology from all over the world. An idea originated by his father, Howard.In Russia, Ivan Vanko, brooding after the death of his father, Anton, who had worked with Howard Stark on the early prototype of the power source that now drives Iron Man's suit. He was extradited back to Russia for espionage and made to live in Siberia. Ivan, now seeking revenge works on a suit of his own. Meanwhile back in the USA, Tony Stark has been summoned before a Senate committee who are determined to get him to give them the Iron Man suit for military use. One of the experts called to the hearing is Justin Hammer, one of Stark's former competitors when he made weapons for a living. Bringing his friend, Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes to testify backfires on the committee and Stark wins the day, but things are not over between him and Hammer.Stark now decides to hand control of Stark Industries over to Pepper Potts having discovered his health is at risk from wearing the suit. The papers are drawn up and a woman from the legal department, Natalie Rushman, brings them for signing. She impresses Stark and later becomes Pepper's assistant. Heading to Monaco, Stark decides to compete in a motor race. He is surprised when Ivan Vanko turns up and destroys his car with plasma whips. Fortunately, Pepper is there with his Iron Man suit and he manages to subdue the Russian. Vanko goes to jail but is later sprung by someone who is very interested in his work.Returning home, Stark prepares for his birthday party, but with many things praying on his mind he gets drunk wearing the suit and ends up in a fight with Rhodey. Enter Nick Fury who helps put Stark back on the road to recovery and reveal that someone close to him is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Hammer is due to show the work he has been doing at Stark's Expo and he has a few things he wants to surprise him with. Things are brewing up for a big fight at the end, but I don't want to spoil it for you, I'll just say it's pretty spectacular and Vanko isn't finished with Stark just yet.This is a very well made film with plenty of very well designed and executed special effects. The score is great, but if you put AC/DC, The Clash and Queen in there you're always going to get my vote! The performances were all good, special mentions go to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko. Honourable mentions go to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.I must admit I didn't much care for the character of Tony Stark at first, he is egotistic and narcissistic. As the film went on he did show he does have a human side though. Justin Hammer is equally egotistic which I found made for an interesting dynamic to this good versus evil story. I also had a problem with America being the centre of everything, yet again, it's like the rest of the world doesn't exist! (Apart from Monaco). Although I did find it amusing when Stark is standing in front of a giant US flag projected on a screen with an Australian/British rock band providing the music. But enough of these minor niggles, the film is great fun, not as good as the first one, but as sequels go, it's certainly watchable. Over all, recommended.My score: 7.2/10","10/10"

Juvenile. Predictable. Embarrassing.Supposedly Mickey Rourke actually spent time in a Moscow prison and studied Russian history to ""prepare for his role"" ... erm, for what exactly, to play a human cartoon? If you'd told me he got the part in the morning and was shooting by midday I'd have no reason to doubt that. His character was stunningly dreadful. As were everyone else of course.Only bright spot in an otherwise abysmal 2 hours of cinematic shite was Sam Rockwell. As ever, he's interesting and fun to watch.

Robert Downey Jr is an on screen delight...his method of acting is so much fun to watch. He has a charisma that many actors of today seriously lack. He took on the role of Tony Stark as if he was truly that man. He had perfect chemistry with everyone, and I was sorry to see the movie end.

"Iron Man 2","NightmareOnElmStreetFan","6 July 2019","I love the first Iron Man I like Iron Man 2 It is a big step down from the first movie, seen it for the first time I try to understand the movie what they try to do with this film. The acting, the tone everything in this movie fall flat, but it is decent at least is not boring or stupid like Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) that movie sucks so much!!! It is a damn good action MCU movie I am taking ""Iron Man 2"" over the new MARVEL films anytime . It is part of my life so Iron Man 2 is a decent okay action film at best. They are worst MARVEL films I totally hate than the second entry in ""Iron Man"" trilogy. Iron Man 2 I will still watch it. Iron Man 2 is good/bad mixed film and an okay at best.The action sequences are good specially the fights on a race track with Whiplash and Iron Man I like that. Samuel L. Jackson is perfect as Nick Fury I wish his character would have more much to do, but the screen writer did not let his character more to do except giving Tony Stark advices. I liked that Tony Stark tried to fix the things he broke it and he tried to make sure with the new element that he structured in his arc reactor and ends his palladium so that he want die. Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff was her first gig and she was okay I liked her. But acrobatic stunts Johansson's stuntwoman for the fights in which Black Widow fights off Hammer's bodyguards were all fake and not realistic.AC/DC return for this film with three soundtracks: Thunderstruck, Shoot to Thrill and Highway to Hell I like those songs for the movie. So yes AC/DC is one of the reasons why I don't consider Iron Man 2 as the worst MCU movie ever. Listen to this soundtracks and you will enjoy your self. The opening scene in which Iron Man jumps off the plane and you hear that song I like very much. I mean Robert Downey Jr. didn't do a terrible performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man but his character in this movie was a disaster. Paul Bettany's voice as JARVIS is till good and like able to the film.The rest of the film is a completely disaster they make Iron Man in to total joke in this movie. Jon Favreau ruined the movie what was he thinking? And he got crap for Iron Man Three while in that movie he was decent in here he wasn't. Iron Man 2 is MILES much way better film than Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) I will never watch that movie again!!!","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","thesar-2","9 May 2010","Well, I enjoyed the two action sequences in the two plus hours of Iron Man 2.That's an exaggeration, but not by much. It wouldn't be so bad if the plot could sustain the rest and for the most part, it didn't.And that was the biggest problem with Iron Man 2. Along with the poor editing and the excessive character additions, like the original Batman series, the rushed and over bloated storyline really weighed down the movie. Sure, Downey Jr. did his best, and was a real saving grace, but even he had to realize this movie was not up to par.(Spoiler Alert, but needs to be told as it's the majority of the film) Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is dying due to his heart device, acquired in the first Iron Man, that's poisoning his blood. Oh, sorry. That's plot A. Plot B is about the Government wanting the ""Ironman"" weapon. C involves a secret spy and her not-a-secret boss from another comic book. As for D and E: two revenge-seeking/Stark hating males for alternate reasons. And F is for the conflicted (and replaced actor) friend of Stark. Did I leave any out? Oh, G is for a Walt Disney-like Daddy along with the normal Daddy-Issues. And H is for Giveaways, Charity, Crossovers and a suicidal daredevil.On a personal note, and I'm generally criticized for this – who cares, it's an opinion, I cannot stand Sam Rockwell. Sure Moon was a somewhat good movie, but it wasn't Rockwell that drove that feature. Here, again, he looked out of place and was just plain boring. Like Downey, Jr., he did try, but had an enormously unsuccessful presence. Despite my personal feelings, still, I got what character he was trying to portray, but we've all seen these evil, revenge-minded and jealous corporate guys at least a dozen times before, but with a tremendous amount of believability, pizazz and villainy that Rockwell didn't come close to possessing. Heck, even the unoriginal and obvious villainous character, Obadiah Stane (played by Bridges from the original Iron Man) had the right qualities Rockwell lacked.Though I have a neutral opinion on Rourke, I sincerely felt him miscast in this role and like Rockwell, overshot his ""bad guy role."" It is written that he spent time (visiting, I suppose) a Russian prison and even more time attempting to learn his Russian lines. He even went as far as wanting to do the whole movie in Russian! (Director Favreau thankfully disagreed – he was hard enough to understand when he did speak English.) In probably the worst scene in the movie was their attempt to recreate the Batman/Joker interrogation scene from The Dark Knight. It didn't work as a rip off, nor as a scene on its own. I forgot to mention the not-at-all-funny bird fetish Rourke's character had was his idea. Perhaps he should come back down to earth after his one-time-only great performance in The Wrestler.The rest of the cast was so-so to great. Favreau was funny but his one-man fight seemed so Lethal Weapon 3'ish while Rushman (Johansson) fought off half a dozen or more men. Speaking of Johansson, or her character Rushman, she was great when she kicked butt. Unfortunately those scenes were even fewer than the overall action of the film. Paltrow was so-so and mirrored Vicky Vale (Basinger from Batman) with the number of screams and over-acting/reacting. As previously mentioned Downey Jr. was excellent and kept his scenes going. In fact, for die-hard Downey Jr. fans, this would be a definite recommendation.Overall, the movie felt rushed (and was,) but thankfully due to the always great Downey Jr., the always impressive technology (loved the suitcase,) crossovers (think shield in addition to S.H.I.E.L.D.) and the (good) few and far between action scenes, the movie's worth a viewing. Not on IMAX as I did – I wouldn't go that far. It's more expensive, it's not in 3-D and you get a letterboxed version of it. In fact, it would not be the end of the world to wait for this enormously inferior sequel to his DVD/Bluray.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","bkoganbing","9 May 2010","Iron Man 2 brings Robert Downey, Jr. back as Tony Stark, billionaire playboy by day and Iron Man superhero by night. The film does something unusual for a superhero movie, the mask is stripped away and Iron Man's identity is confessed to and revealed. Now everybody wants a piece of Tony Stark.Starting with the Senate Armed Services Committee headed by Garry Shandling has him subpoenaed and ordered to turn over the technology that created Iron Man. As survival was the first goal of the creation that seems like not a good solution to Downey. Rival defense conglomerate head Sam Rockwell also wants in on the technology.In a plot that was lifted from the cult Fifties science fiction classic Red Planet Mars, Rockwell makes a deal with Russian Mickey Rourke to get the technology. Rourke's father apparently was working along the same lines as Downey's father and he feels the Iron Man concept was stolen by him. He and Rockwell make a Faustian bargain.In the meantime Downey just wants to get away from it all and even turns his company over to best girl pal Gwyneth Paltrow. Gwyneth who seems to be all legs in this film is really up in it trying to deal with business and Downey at the same time. Another woman who has some mean limbs herself is security expert Scarlett Johanssen who leaves a trail of broken males strewn in her path when she's on a mission.Of course the special effects are what the movie-going public is paying to see and I note that there is an IMAX version of Iron Man 2 out there which only seems right. If I can I should try to see it in that media.If I had a favorite in the cast I would say it was Rockwell. His rivalry with Downey is something to behold. I do love the way these two market their defense wares for the government. It was like they left the promotion to Vince McMahon. Is this the way of the future?Folks who love the superhero genre will love Iron Man 2. The rest of us are somewhat amused.","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","illbebackreviews","18 May 2013","Often considered to be a critical disappointment that cannot match the same brilliance as the original, I was sceptical about watching this film. As one of the people who liked the original but didn't love it, I thought that maybe I wouldn't be as sorely disappointed by this film as die hard Iron Man fans were. The thing with this film is that most viewers either love it or hate it so it is truly difficult to take a side in it.Iron Man 2 tells the story of Tony Stark who has now revealed that he is indeed Iron Man and continues to enforce peace across the world until he meets a new enemy who has his plans to get revenge on Stark, whilst at the same time discovering that he is dying. Will Stark be able to keep his legacy and ensure that the people believe in Iron Man or will he fail? To be fair, I didn't hate this movie. I actually really liked it. Surely not as great as the original but this film sure nears it in my opinion. With dazzling visual effects, a mostly outstanding script that makes way for many laughs throughout the film, Iron Man 2 is a mostly engaging film with a great story and extremely special action sequences. I love in this film how Stark is once more put to test and how the original ended with Stark revealing that he is Iron Man. That allows the film to be free of any restrictions and give more fun to the film. Some of the stuff that Stark does throughout the film are truly idiotic and hilarious, and can only be thought of as hilarious due to the performance that Robert Downrey Jr gives.Robert Downrey Jr is truly the scene stealer and he just completely steals the film in every way. He is energetic, he is charming, he is funny yet he can also be a more dramatic person. Everyone else does a great job in the film, mainly Samuel L Jackson playing S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury. His performance isn't anything special from Jackson like Pulp Fiction but his presence is always welcome throughout the film. Scarlett Johannsson is great in the role of Natasha and the final action sequences in the film with her were truly great.Iron Man 2 is not nearly as great as its predecessor but is nevertheless, a fun and entertaining film with plenty of laughs and plenty of amazing visual effects and some absolutely fantastic action sequence. In terms of its action, it is possibly better than the original and also has a greater villain. The acting is fantastic by Robert Downrey Jr and everyone else does their part well. Iron Man 2 is nevertheless an engaging film and is honestly, either a guilty pleasure for myself or an underrated and overly criticized film.","10/10"

"Iron Man 2","kaden_lewis","12 June 2021","This was a solid sequel. It had everything a sequel needs, it had a good plot to follow the first movie, it had a worthy villain, and some good acting, which Marvel casts never disappoint in. Just like The Incredible Hulk, this was a very underrated MCU movie. I gave The Incredible Hulk and 8/10 (7.5/10), I think this movie deserves a 7.8/10, not quite an 8/10, but still a pretty high score. I thought the Final battle scene was the best of the first three MCU movies, the other two were just too short, this was was nice and semi-lengthy without becoming boring, that is all you can ask for. I also enjoyed that we got introduced to Black Widow in this movie, even though Scarlett Johansson wasn't the first choice to play Black Widow, I think she did a fantastic job, and can't wait to see what she does with the character next.I really enjoyed this movie, I honestly recommend it to anyone who watched the first movie, it is a great movie overall.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","Bruce722","24 May 2013","This movie was nowhere near as good as the first one. First of all, I hate when they replace main characters in movies. I understand that it's not necessarily the fault of the film but replacing Terrance Howard with Don Cheadle affects the feel of the movie; similar to when they replaced Katie Holmes with Maggie Gylenhaul in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Also, a technology that was pushed to be so incredible and impossible to replicate in the first installment is thrown around in this movie like if it's no more rare than an std. Lastly, similar to the first film, there were some huge plot holes. If a villain's weapons are a sort of lasso, wouldn't common sense tell you to just fire on him from outside of the lasso range? I would certainly think a genius like Tony Stark would be able to figure that out. Also, if you access the main computer and can reset the War Machine, why couldn't you also reset the others? Nonetheless, Robert Downey Jr. once again proves to be a top notch actor in Hollywood and the movie's transition to the ""Avengers"" adds some excitement to an otherwise quick and overrated ending. Still, I was a little disappointed.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","chains01","14 May 2010","Taking place six months after the first Iron Man, Iron Man 2 finds a world where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has successfully ""privatized world peace,"" but fearing other countries getting their hands on Stark's Iron Man technology the Senate seeks to have Tony hand over the technology to the government. Also seeking to steal Stark's technology is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who wants to regain a weapons contract with the military. Complicating things further, a mysterious Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) turns up to destroy Tony Stark.Iron Man was a huge surprise when it came out in the early summer of 2008. A 2nd tier Marvel comic book, Iron Man became one of the top grossing movies of 2008, and even held it's own very well against the juggernaut that was The Dark Knight despite it's much smaller fanbase. It also resurrected Robert Downey Jr.'s career, showing that he was capable of leading a franchise despite his past mistakes, and showed that Jon Favreau was a viable action director. Since then Downey has found himself nominated for two Golden Globes winning one of them, and added yet another big action franchise to the current notch in his belt. Of course, all eyes are on Iron Man 2 to see if the movie will top it's predecessor in the expectations department, so how does it hold up.In my opinion, Iron Man 2 equals it's predecessor. The second installment of Iron Man is funnier than the original, and it ups the ante on the action from the first movie as well. What really makes the movie though, is not the action, but the characterizations. Fleshing out Stark's narcissism as well as his inabilities to deal with his emotions opens new doors into the character. Favreau and new writer to the series Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunderdo a great job of handling a large cast that would normally sink most other comic book franchises.The casting in this movie is superb even if it seems jarring to see so many actors and actresses playing characters that aren't typical for them. Apart from The Spirit and The Island, Scarlett Johansson hasn't played an outright action fueled character, but she equips herself admirably to play the part of a believable martial arts trained heroine. Don Cheadle does a great job taking over the role of Rhodey from Terrence Howard, and even tops his predecessor. Sam Rockwell does a superb job as Stark's rival, and a man who tries his hardest to be as iconic as Tony Stark, but fails miserably on all counts. Mickey Rourke steals nearly every scene he's in, though, as Russian physicist Ivan Vanko. I was never sure if I would be able to buy him as a Russian, but the work he put into researching for the character definitely paid off.On the downside though, sometimes it feels as though there's too much of a rush to get from one point to the next. Scenes feel as though they move to the next before they're truly done playing out. Unfortunately, this is one of the issues of having such a large cast that needs to have proper screen time to flesh out the characters. To add to that, the second half of the film is a bit derivative of other action films. While the film may do a great job of going in a different direction than other comic book films by outing it's central character and performing a character study on a man who thrives on his popularity in that position, but in the last act of the movie it falls into the same trap as other action movies with an ending that can be cliché.All in all, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like movies based on comic books and if you like the first Iron Man. Franchises like Iron Man, the current Batman series, and Kick-Ass set a new benchmark for comic book movies and action movies in general. With great action, acting, characterization, and originality these movies have moved beyond their genres to capture something that extends beyond it's core audience.4.5/5","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","jpach31","28 May 2010","The old saying goes that when people retire, they don't come back head strong. I disapprove very strongly whoever said that. When Iron Man come on the scene in 2008 as a remake of the original comic book, I said it wouldn't last. I was completely, out-of-my-freaking-mind, THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!!! I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","coasterdude44","11 December 2019","An entertaining sequel and a competent continuation in the Marvel franchise, the film is focussed more on Tony Stark's personal life and his contribution to to his company of Stark Industries. The cgi special effects have improved from the first film quite a bit and the characters are just as entertaining as ever. The film does lull a bit in some parts and is a bit unevenly paced, however the action scenes do make up for some of the parts that drag on a bit longer than others.It is my least favourite film in the trilogy but it still makes up for some of it's flaws, it could have been handled much worse as the realm of sequels is always rocky to tread on in a lot of ways. But if you're a fan of Marvel this movie wont disappoint you and I do recommend it","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","zofos","21 May 2010","The first Iron Man was a delight to behold. When Tony Stark eventually took to the skies in his fully-operational red Iron Man suit and flew to Afghanistan, the movie took on a giddy, magical feel not seen since ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeve back in the day. It was so clear what Iron Man could do and who his enemies were.The same cannot be said for ""Iron Man 2"" which is lumbered with a script that is just dreadful and fails to deliver on every level.Take the first scene between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow. The makers must have been trying to do some sort of rapid-fire screwball comedy dialogue but all they succeed in doing is getting the actors to talk over one another so its hard to make out what's being said. What they say isn't funny or interesting either, it's all shallow sound bites.Superhero movies are only as good as their villain, e.g. Doc Ock in ""Spiderman 2"" or Lex Luthor in Chris Reeves ""Superman"" movies. The villain in ""Iron Man 2"" is a Russian called Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke (I hope he was paid well, as it does nothing for him or his career.) Whiplash makes his big arrival in the movie by attacking Tony Stark's racing car with electrified whips. This is a good start but once Whiplash has his whips taken from him, he becomes a very ordinary villain indeed with no other special powers to threaten Iron Man with. He is taken off to jail almost immediately and fades into the background for most of the film. It makes Whiplash look foolish instead of menacing and the character never recovers. His motivation for attacking Tony Stark/Iron Man is also not very clear or convincing, something about his father being betrayed by Stark's father but it's never explained any further(a flashback might have helped).Scarlett Johannson looks gorgeous and tough as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff. She has some killer moves but strangely never gets to use them on the villain Whiplash. That would have made the script more interesting.There is also an appearance by Samuel L. Jackson wearing an eye-patch that seems to set up the long-in-development Avengers movie that teams up the Marvel characters. It's a diversion about money that we don't need, it takes us out of the story when it should be all about getting Whiplash.Then there's the finale. Whiplash attacks Stark again and fails...again (he's clearly incompetent). The resolution is far too easy. There's no twist to make Stark work hard for victory and that's boring.Sam Rockwell, as the other villain, unveils a series of drone-style Iron Men and they gang up to attack Iron Man and his pal (Don Cheadle also in an Iron Man suit) but there are so many flying around at the end and the editing is so rapid that it's hard to tell what's happening. It's muddled, where the original ""Iron Man"" was crystal clear. That's the problem with this sequel. It feels rushed. The stench of desperation to top the first movie comes off the screen. Better take more care with ""Iron Man 3.""P.S. Sam Rockwell's dancing is hilarious. It's almost worth another star.","1/10"
"Iron Man 2","sjd615","30 May 2010","The sequel in the Iron Man series is one that is very welcoming, original for a second movie and a great blast of a movie to kick off the summer right. It was a lot of fun, there WAS a great villain, awesome action scenes with likable characters. The movie was a perfect length at about 2 hours but some scenes I felt could have been left out and even a character as well. As Scarlett Johanson is very attractive her character could have easily been never put in because there is no real importance even though it was refreshing and she brings the sex appeal to the movie goers. I really enjoyed the movie and it is actually a worth while sequel to an eventually long and spread out series in the future. This second film was an exiting experience that had comic relief in certain parts of the movie. It is not full of action but when there is, it is very cool as the special effects are awesome. Overall, i recommend all movie fans to see this movie. It is a great time, not really any swearing and suitable for the kids of all ages.","8/10"

Yes iron man 1 is much better and may be the best mcu movie to date but I don't think this movie deserves a 6.9, more like a 7.5 because it has great action, great acting, an amazing cast and it's just a fun easy watch. Is it as good as Iron Man 1 or 3? No, but it is still amazing, and compared to some of the new mcu films, I'm sure everyone would be very happy to get another movie like this again. I also think that the newer movies are rated higher cause of more mcu fanboys and fan girls, but this movie came out when there were less fans and trust me to movie is amazing, it just didn't live up to the iron man 1 standard, but it's a great fun film.","7/10"

Add to it some allegedly going on sense of love during and after the explosions, and you get Iron Man, dubbed 2.It is unfortunate that the movie fell behind on 3D in making, which is the de-facto expectation today from any high-budget action movie, so it came out flat on a few things, figuratively speaking :) Also, contrary to the expectation of a longer movie, it came out even shorter than the original: 1:52m vs 1:56m, so it does feel short, especially after watching a 2:35m Avatar spectacle.Still, I enjoyed it, but not sure if I'd see it again, unless it is re-released in 3D.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","islander7one","30 April 2010","Well, it's happened again for the armored Avenger. It's no wonder that everyone is again praising Iron Man in some way. Iron Man 2 is the best comic adaptation movie ever made. The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. Now, the sequel advances as well if not better than the previous great ""number 2's"" in history. Spider-Man 2, X2 and TDK all took the second films of the franchise to new heights. Iron Man 2 does the same and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 2 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle was certainly an upgrade. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. It utilizes great dialogue that's witty, perfect use of humor yet again, advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best sequel of the decade. This is truly movie-making of the highest order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. Long live the new king! What makes Iron Man a true rarity is that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult. How many movies can you say that about?","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","blacklist-1","2 May 2010","I though the first Iron Man was really great, with a new idea and great story, superb action and great acting with enough in depth about the characters to make you care and give the story substance, but I'm afraid Iron Man 2 just falls into the typical sequel trap of just trashy fun wanting to cash in on the first. It is great fun. Downey Junior is still excellent as Stark and very funny. The action sequences were fun and the special effects were amazing. Not to mention there was some good music and Downey Jr gave the script in parts wit.But the script was mostly awful with thin characters. I could see the director Jon Favreau try to flesh them out but the multiple stories didn't work, which loses that in depth of the characters and why we care for them. He tries to do the multiple narrative like Sam Raimi in Spiderman 2 who successfully had the main story with there sub-plots that blended seamlessly together beautifully with the depth of the characters understanding the motivations behind there choices and decisions and making you care about them but Favreau fails in this respect. Micky Rourke dosen't make a lasting impression as villain Whiplash and Scarlet Johansson though pretty was extremely underused. There is not motivation for her character. Also there are some gaping plot holes like why when Whiplash escapes from prison is it not reported by the media? And he goes to the grand prix track to kill Stark whose one of the drivers but he didn't even know he was there because he arrives before he sees him and we're not made aware Whiplash knows he's there making the character and film a bit dumb and forfeiting credibility as a result. Saying that there was plenty of action sequences, which were done really well and were exciting to watch as a result. But on the flip side, it leaves too little room for story and character development (whereas Batman Begins and Spiderman 2 balanced out the action and story perfectly).Good trashy fun yes, which I enjoyed but it's not as amazing as people make out. I really was expecting much more and I was quite disappointed on the whole. This had potential and I could tell Favreau tries with the multi-plots but it just fails. This dosen't live up to the hype it's received but it's still worth seeing. I hope the third shows improvement.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","kelboy10","1 November 2019","With Starks alter ego Iron Mans status well and truly established on the world, a new terror is rising in Ivan Vanko. Mickey Rourke plays the cold hearted Vanko, distant, undisturbed and focused on nothing but his mission. The mission to avenge his father and pay a dept he believes the Stark family owe. Much like the first movie the light hearted charm remains in Stark and Pepper. Iron Man 2 is a rollercoaster ride. Stark is unwilling to give up his technology and weapons now the world knows he is Iron Man and arrogant in his beliefs that the rest of the world is nowhere near in designing a battle suit close to his. Expert research must have been made because because Robert Downey Jr is the personification of Stark and Iron Man. Each character has been perfectly cast for this movie. Mickey Rourke is excellent as the Russian hell bent on revenge a vendetta that goes back to his father being exiled from stark industries. Don Cheadle is now playing Rhodes and although I prefer Terrace Howard in this role Don Cheadle is worthy of the part as war machine. Reluctant to dulvage the secrets of his technology Stark is boastful and makes more enemies in fellow business man Justin Hammer. Overall the film is similar to the first and doesn't really bring nothing new to the table, but I'd say Rourke has more screen time than Jeff Bridges had in the first film and made for a more compelling villain. The effects and locations make for an all round well thought out movie and although the story has no real twist it has enough to keep viewers watching.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","Someguysomwhere","14 September 2010","The plot: There are 2 story threads here that merge. 1. The government and military are putting pressure on Tony Stark to turn over the Iron Man Technology to them. 2. Some Russian guy blames Tony's dad for the persecution and death of his own father and seeks revenge. How he goes about it ties into the government's claims that the Iron man technology is better served by giving it to them. Analysis: Enjoyable action-filled movie; well acted and written. Worth your time. If you're not a comic book buff or nut you don't need to read further. You have all you need.Some entertainers (actors, musicians, athletes, IMDb reviewers,etc.) use a ""stage"" name and the public is generally unaware of their real name or private identity. But if some find out what their real name is (as sometimes happens) it might not matter because they're more familiar with the stage name and persona and prefer it. In this instance the private identity is eclipsed or overshadowed by the familiar and public persona. However, because Tony Stark is well known in his own right as a famous inventor and head of a well known company (Stark Industries, Inc.) this would not happen. Not to mention the fact that he enjoys attention; seems to need it; thrives on it; is a bit of a ham.So I gotta ask: when people see Iron Man flying across the sky, do they say, ""There goes Iron Man"", --or do they say, ""There goes Tony Stark""? There are practical reasons why super heroes (and people involved in important and dangerous operations) need a secret identity; need to maintain a separation; and I'm sure you can guess them. So while I enjoyed the movie, and while I know it's just fantasy, I cannot help but wonder at the unnecessary and foolish recklessness and vanity of Tony Stark that makes him put so much at risk in order to share the limelight with his alter ego Iron Man. And this is beside the point: What is it about good-looking women in form-fitting outfits that beat people up that turns me on? Love, Boloxxxi.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","jonnyfendi","30 April 2010","It is always exciting every time we watch Iron Man movie. Complete action package, great characters interest and interlude with effective humor. Tony Starks is an eccentric, self-centered but genius multi-billionaire who builds Iron Man suit. Thiz time, he faces health issue and ready to confront another thread from his business rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and mysterious villain Whiplash (Mickey Rourke). In the first Iron Man two years ago, I said to everyone that Tony Starks in that movie was too humanist, which was so wrong. Starks should appear more arrogant to present his original character (If you ask me thiz kind of stuff. Well, comic is my world. I recall when my dad bought me first Iron Man's issue from overseas). But at thiz sequel, Iron Man character really fills my expectation. Robert Downey Jr. acts amazingly well, improving his first appearance. The most powerful element in Iron Man's movies is simply Robert Downey Jr. himself. Mickey Rourke is our other attention after his breathtaking performance in ""The Wrestler"" (2008). He plays save for his villain character and it looks just fine. For the fight scene, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is surprisingly kick ass. I don't know whether is the camera angle or the fight choreography that makes it so attractive, Johansson really left behind her girly image. Unfortunately, I don't like Nick Fury's character (Samuel L. Jackson) which is reconstructed from Nick Fury's original character. Other mentionable performances are Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. The movie is directed by former Actor, Jon Favreau. His previous directing credits are ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005) and the comedy ""Elf"" (2003). It's almost very difficult to say thiz movie isn't a good one. Apparently it's an excellent and entertaining movie for everyone. Can't wait for another Starks Expo!

His scenes in the first act are excellent.And then there's of course the introduction of Scarlet Johanssen as Natasha/Black Widow. Damn if she doesn't suck up all the air in every single scene she's in as she insinuates herself into Stark's inner circle. She morphs from Tony's ""siren"" (Stark's a better man than I would likely be in a similar circumstance) to a bad-ass MMA fighter.It actually calls out the absurdity of not spinning off a Black Widow off earlier. This was clearly pre-Me Too, but shameful nonetheless.The special effects are again excellent.

"Iron Man 2","Movie_Muse_Reviews","7 May 2010","Superhero movie follow-ups have been a tough business lately. ""Iron Man 2"" marks Marvel's first sequel since ""Spider-Man 3"" left millions disappointed in 2007. So to quell any lingering fears, ""Iron Man 2"" is not a letdown. It's far from it. To think director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey Jr. would lose sight of what they did that turned a lesser Marvel character into a multi-million-dollar franchise would be a gross underestimation.Downey Jr. does not relinquish Iron Man's reputation as the wittiest superhero ever brought to the big screen. ""Iron Man 2"" provides just as much of a humorous joyride as the 2008 film, backing up all the subtly outrageous dialogue with superb visual effects and action that seizes all attention. It all still works because Favreau has locked down the blend between not taking the story too seriously but still telling it with conviction.But oh yes, ""Iron Man 2"" complicates things a bit. Self-outted billionaire superhero Tony Stark aka Iron Man has a lot on his plate from government subpoenas asking him to hand his suit over to the people to a private matter: his fake heart -- the arc reactor -- is slowly poisoning him. Feeling like it all might cave in on him, Tony makes his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), Stark Industries' new C.E.O. Screenwriter Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder"") accepts the responsibility of weaving these plot lines in with three new significant characters. Mickey Rourke assumes the villain role: silently vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko, who after a failed attempt at using his own whip-toting arc-reactor suit to kill Tony in the film's first action sequence on a Monaco raceway, finds himself in the employ of Tony's arms-dealing nemesis, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). With Tony going in and out of the public's good graces, Hammer uses Vanko to create droid soldiers for the military, which would effectively make him the real ""American hero."" Scarlett Johansson goes redhead for a supporting role as one of Tony's new assistants who is more than she appears to be.The busyness continues because of Marvel's commitment to an eventual ""Avengers"" film in 2012 combining Iron Man and heroes of future Marvel films. Samuel L. Jackson appears as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D, looking to recruit Tony for his team and nudging him in the right direction as Tony's deceased father, Howard, holds the answer to his ""heart condition.""The overcrowding, however, never gets the best of ""Iron Man 2."" Theroux has designed the story to move along quickly and effectively, letting the action and the humor carry the entertainment factor evenly throughout the film. The unfortunate trade-off is that very little resonates about ""Iron Man 2."" Tony's attempt to find a new core element for his arc reactor is the one true through-line. Everything else from Tony's feuding with Pepper and his buddy Jim Rhodes (Cheadle) to Hammer's frustrations with Vanko's progress to Nick Fury all act in service of the plot. The element of Tony's irresponsibility and alcoholism, perhaps the greatest potential of the film to make any kind of statement, appears in only a couple brief scenes. Downey Jr. and Favreau give us many great Tony Stark moments, but he doesn't have a chance to grow -- just make us laugh and remember how great a character he is.And honestly, how great a character he is. Downey Jr.'s shtick hasn't gotten old in the least despite his increased exposure the last two years and the writing caters to him even more this time around. Maybe a lesser actor playing a lesser character wouldn't be able to lift up a busy superhero story with this many subplots, but RDJ has that ability. With an imaginative visual effects crew at his back and a director who knows how to condense action and make it count, he'll likely continue providing easy-to-love action entertainment as Iron Man no matter how many different chinks these films develop in their armor.-Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","funkyfry","22 November 2010","I'm not a huge fan of this series..... the first film started out exceptionally poor with horrible racial stereotypes and ridiculous effects, then entered an interesting and entertaining middle stage that dealt with anti-hero issues, and concluded in a predictable underwhelming confrontation. The sequel has a more exciting battle at the end, but very little before it to really keep me interested. From its first moments it presents a cliché landscape of cgi robot action, PG-13 level exploitation values, and absurd character relationships.The new writer, Justin Theroux, has produced a film that plays even more to the lowest common denominator, which is quite surprising considering his public persona as a fringe badboy in terms of acting (he's appeared in many David Lynch films, among others). The film lacks any sense that there's a larger structure hanging over the proceedings. About the only ongoing plot is the idea that Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is sick/dying and that Pepper Potts (Paltrow) doesn't know about it. Everything about the film is designed not to exceed the capacity or appetite of 14 year old boys. Theroux is clearly primarily a comedy writer, as evidenced by his only previous credit on ""Tropic Thunder"" (a much more entertaining Downey Jr. film and performance).The worst thing about films such as this, and the Pirates of the Caribbean films with Johnny Depp, is that they have proved that the best actors of our generation can be debased and turned into engines for boring action franchises. There was a time when serious actors wouldn't go near a kiddie movie like this. While Downey Jr. provides much of the film's humor, you have to feel like he's wasting his own time as much as ours. Mickey Rourke, after a nice performance in ""The Wrestler"", reminds us once again of why he lost popularity in the first place: his performance is all smug and self-satisfied, as if it's enough to be a villain to speak in an awful Russian accent and walk around with a smirk. And what was with the bird? It was like he complained to the scriptwriter and they gave him that as a ""character quirk"" even though it has no meaning and does nothing for the film.Very poorly written film executed in a highly predictable way","10/10"

"Iron Man 2","caseynicholson","30 January 2015","""Iron Man 2"" is the third chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, i.e. the third Marvel Comics movie produced in-house at Marvel Studios. This second episode of ""Iron Man"" sees Robert Downey, Jr. turn out a strong performance as Tony Stark, and the cast of the film does a similarly grand job as that of the original.One notable change in the movie is that Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes is now played by Don Cheadle, as opposed to Terrence Howard who filled the role in the first ""Iron Man"" film. Both Howard and Cheadle turn out strong performances in this role, and it's hard to say which does a better job, but it is a bit of a glaring change, with Cheadle looking so dissimilar from Howard.The rest of the cast all do quite well in this movie, including Gwyneth Paltrow, reprising her role as Pepper Potts, and Mickey Rourke who plays the film's villain, Ivan Vanko (a character who features characteristics of both the Crimson Dynamo and Whiplash, villains from the Iron Man comic books).All in all this film is a strong chapter in the MCU's ongoing Iron Man storyline. The film develops the Tony Stark character, matching it with the classic comic book Tony Stark by introducing us to not just the billionaire playboy, but also to the Stark that struggles with alcoholism and whose own contraption that saved his life is now endangering him with radiation poisoning. Both of those plot features are drawn straight from the 1980's mythology of Iron Man. Likewise, the film goes a step further by introducing us to a larger piece of the MCU puzzle by giving us more information on SHIELD and Howard Stark. Black Widow (aka Natasha Romanov, played by Scarlett Johansson) is also introduced in this movie, and is featured prominently.While it's probably fair to say that this movie falls just short of being as good as its predecessor, again, it's certainly a great, fun movie from Marvel. I rate it at 8/10 stars.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","loveviggomortensen","9 June 2015","It's worth watching to see what happens to Stark and everyone else that was in the first film. One can watch this movie at any time of the day. It would be best to watch the first film to know what happened. There are some things that just wont make sense if you haven't seen the first film yet. Children can watch this movie pretty much at any age. But please parents make sure that your children can watch this type of action pack movie. This movie is at least 8 out of 10 stars. There is a lot of action within the movie. To me this movie is on that list of movies that can be watched multiple times within the year or even years. I'm going to be watching this movie plus all the other Marvel movies in a marathon.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","mombot","4 June 2010","First off, I'll admit I'm not a big fan of either the comics or the first film. However, director John Faverau really did make this enjoyable for us ""non-geeks"" as well as the ""geeks"". Decent story and interactions with Tony and Pepper were enjoyable. I think the weakest writing was for the Scarlett Johnannsen character, but her acting was good in spite of that. The main attraction for me, even though I'm a fan of Robert Downey Jr., was Mickey Rourke and he did not disappoint. He's the best thing about this film when he's in a scene. Not the anyone else is a slouch, but I'm glad Mickey is back in films. I will add that I can't picture anyone else playing Tony Stark, though. Very impressed with the CGI and other special effects. I don't recall as much humor or banter between the characters in the first, but thought it was appropriate (in IM2)and kept the film's tone lighter. Best summer film so far.

"Iron Man 2","iguth","27 April 2019","Iron Man 2 is the sequel of a great film, that is a lot to live up to. This movie provides a lot of much needed character development to Rhodey as well as the introduction of Natalie Rushman. This movie provides Tony Stark with his first real taste of drama between him and the authorities who wish to utilize his technology without him. The two part villain gives the antagonist aspects of the film more depth and creativity. This film also finally marks a good relationship between Pepper and Tony which gives Robert Downey Jr.'s character some needed humanity.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","thepriceofpayne","15 April 2018","Iron Man 2 is the Third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the second film in the Iron Man Franchise, and sadly its not one of those sequels that surpasses the original. While not terrible, Robert Downey Jr. is still as charismatic as ever and we get some great character introductions from Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson, with Don Cheadle replacing Terrance Howard. (which in my opinion was a great replacement) The Story does focus more on The character of Tony Stark, which isn't bad but it's a lot of story and story with little pay off. The action in the end is great, the acting is on par, and Favreau is one of my favorite directors, but the film is just okay. I expected more, but I didn't get anything less.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","RCWjr","10 May 2010","I have given Iron Man 2 the same 8 rating I gave the original. Mainly because both are flawed films, but in the end, are rousing, fun summer movies that do not cater to the lowest common mind level, yet don't take themselves too seriously.Iron Man 2 starts out, much like Spiderman 3, with Tony Stark seemingly basking in the glow of Iron Man's accomplishments (it is set 6 months after the first film). However we learn quickly that Tony is hiding a pain within; the reactor is slowly killing him. A long with that, we learn Tony and his father were not very close, more angst to throw into the pot. Thus we have Tony Stark slowly going out of control and his friends; Pepper, Happy and Rhodie must pull him in.The first half comes off a bit uneven to me, not sure why, it just never seemed to find a steady groove. It is not the pace, as with the first, there is never any moments of watch checking, it just had an uneven flow of one scene to the next for me, like they were trying to find the groove but not quite getting it. It isn't until an hour into the film that it finally found a rhythm for me. Once it did find that rhythm it brought the film home, with an excellent 3rd act.Performances across the board are excellent. I have to say I missed Howard as Rhodie. Cheadle is by no means a slouch actor, but he doesn't have the same presence in uniform that Howard had. Johanson brings everything you would expert to the siren role she is cast in. Definitely look forward to seeing more of her in further adventures. Rourke is his usual method self, totally absorbed in the role of Whiplash and eating up every scene he is in.One of the things I enjoyed most about the film is the continual interweaving of the whole Marvel universe, especially the hints of other characters involved with the Avengers. We are actually introduced to the Avenger concept in the film, which, for the comic geeks out there, will be a glorious thing to witness. Another is the expanded role of Tony's father, which is done through old news and company reel, but helps to give us more of a full view of the Stark patriarch and more importantly, his feelings toward his song Tony, who has felt he never quite measured up to his father's expectations.My two main complaints with the film are minor ones, but still kept it from being a 9. The first I have already mentioned, the first hour was herky jerky, never seeming to find a steady groove. This was resolved by the last hour and it gave us a much improved upon 3rd act, one of the flaws that the first film had in that the 3rd act was entertaining, but lacked a grand finale feel. My other complaint is the score. I absolutely loved the score for the first film. The mix of guitar and drum interwoven with string and horns made for a score that felt at home with a move titled Iron Man. This go around, no such guitar or drum woven score. The ""theme"" from the first film isn't even used again, a minor complaint, but one that took me out of the film a little as the first score really worked well and is sorely missed here. Composer Ryeland Allison and original music by Ramin Djawadi gave us an excellent score in the first. This go around they are replaced by John Debney who gives us a lackluster score.Lastly on the music front, don't believe the hype about the Iron Man 2 soundtrack, which purports to be nothing but AC/DC. There are only 2 songs by AC/DC in the entire film. So not sure why the soundtrack CD, which has 15 songs by AC/DC, is being purported as being the soundtrack, which it is not. Again, a slight critique, but something fans should know going in.My complaints are minimal, the film delivers on exactly what it should and it brings forth a start, of what looks to be a very fun and exciting summer full of theater entertainment. Oh yeah, one final thing, DO NOT GET UP AND LEAVE BEFORE THE END CREDITS. Wait them out, you will be pleasantly surprised, especially if you are a Marvel/Avengers fan.","9/10"

"Iron Man 2","piratecannon","29 December 2012","Iron Man 2 is not The Dark Knight. And it shouldn't be.For my money, I can't think of a movie that better embodies the term ""popcorn flick."" Like its predecessor, this one is all about fun. There are rock 'em sock 'em explosions aplenty, as well as some slickly filmed fight sequences that are quite memorable (but, honestly, aren't earth-shattering when compared to any number of other uber-energetic comic book films of the last decade). Don't be fooled, though; this sequel to the 2008 hit actually builds on the mythos of Tony Stark in some welcome ways.Front and center in this particular feature is ""the past""—that is, it's very much focused on Howard Stark (Tony's father) and his vision of a futuristic society that thrives on the energy derived from his Arc Reactor. There are also some other juicy tidbits we learn about Stark Sr., not the smallest of which has a little something to do with rewriting the periodic table. Also thrown into the mix is a physicist who worked with Howard back in the day. He's a disgruntled Russian who feels he's been slighted because—among other things—of Tony's success. He's got a son of his own named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), and he's determined to avenge his father's legacy at all costs. Yes, the plot is driven by a stereotypical variation on the revenge story we're all familiar with, but, given the already superficial nature of the film (which, let's be honest, we all expected), it works well.Iron Man 2, quite simply, does everything a competent sequel should. In this case, it further highlights the flaws of its protagonist, and it builds on the comedy/action pairing that made the original film so successful. It even ties in new characters—such as Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff—who are fairly interesting in their own right while settting itself up for a third film that will (hopefully) continue the trend.Despite all its upward momentum, Iron Man 2 does falter from time to time. As is the case with many-a-movie, our hero solves seemingly impossible ""puzzles"" in record time (here, we're talking about scientific enigmas that can only be deciphered with the use of improvised proton accelerators). This directly correlates with a looming sense of danger—developed by a specific plot element that I won't ruin here—that's established early in the film, and, because of this ridiculously absurd ""quick fix,"" said surprisingly tangible sense of dread is undercut in an extraordinarily premature manner.But, again, what did you expect? This is Iron Man 2, not the philosophical diatribe of a makeup wearing psychopath. As tired as I am of this clichéd phrase, it still applies: ""It is what it is."" Because of that, there should be zero complaints.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","Fluke_Skywalker","28 August 2014","'Iron Man 2' has a reputation for being both not as good as the original and for being bogged down by set-up for 'The Avengers'. Both of these things are certainly true, but they're ultimately not tragic flaws.Though the villains and the stakes feel inconsequential, 'IM2' zips along at a fast clip, and fueled by great performances and a far more exciting and satisfying finale than its predecessor, it manages to entertain while also laying the foundation that the entire MCU is built upon.Flaws and all, 'Iron Man 2' is still a worthwhile entry into the MCU, and well worth revisiting for those who may not have liked it the first time.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","barbagvido","27 June 2016","Whenever someone mentions Iron Man 2, they usually call it bad or say something bad about it. But I think it was actually pretty good and I had so much fun. I guarantee, you won't be bored for a second.It wasn't better than the first Iron Man, but it was better than The Incredible Hulk. It's lighter than The Incredible Hulk, but darker than Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. shines again in the leading role and this time we is developed a lot more than in the first one. In the first one, he is shown as this cool, funny scientist who becomes a superhero, but what I liked here the most is that we get to see that he is no more than just another ordinary human with his own personal conflicts. We get to see who Tony Stark really is. This movie also brings us some new faces: Scarlett Johansson as a super-cool female hero Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as one out of the two villains is really annoying but that's probably the way his character is supposed to be so I don't blame him, with the other villain being played by Mickey Rourke. And why Rourke was decent, he was just that typical Russian villain you see in many Hollywood movies. And also, Terrence Howard was recast and Don Cheadle got his role and I can say that Cheadle may even be a bit better. Some people say that a big problem of this movie is that it's setting up MCU too much. But if you ask me, that kinda had to happen eventually and they made it fit with the plot so it isn't all over the place.Overall, this movie was very entertaining and it's also probably the best of the ""weaker"" MCU movies so far.","1/10"

The film surely passes it's pressedor. But i thought the last scene battling Whiplash was short. Whiplash uses his electrical string and just flipped it to Iron Man and War Machine, then they used their hand power and blast it in each other making Whiplash die. Acting was nice, visual and actions and good. The action was actually better than the first one quite a lot. But the bad thing that the movie was so short. Around 126=2 hours 6 minutes long. If it was around 130 minutes, it would be betterSo now i gave you my review, i would give this movie a 10.10 I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves Iron Man.

"Iron Man 2","razvan9310","24 May 2010","What makes this second part of the Iron Man live story better is that it sticks to the genuine comic books characters.

Also, great secondary characters: well-playing Sam Rockwell and gorgeous Scarlett Johansson. Enjoyable action and promising after-credits ending. Heck, AC/DC music, too! I gave this movie 8 out of 10, for being a comic books and IM fan, but any SF, Action and why not Drama consumer would surely enjoy it.

"Iron Man 2","TourettesPersonal","10 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is not as good as the first movie. This movie has many plots and dialogue, and there were only have few action scenes. It is still entertaining and it didn't ended up like Transformers 2(why did i compare TF2 anyway?). I love to give this movie a perfect score but it's disappointing.Iron Man 2 wasn't a bad film it's just disappointing because it's not that action pack. It has only 3 or 4 action scenes, and 2 of them were long and the rest didn't last a minute. By the way the first movie only had 3 fights and those 3 were long. Good thing the finale in Iron Man 2 is more awesome and has more explosion than the first Iron Man's finale. The music score of the first Iron Man movie was better. The cast is entertaining. Robert Downey Jr. is still awesome. Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell are entertaining villains. Scarlett Johansson is hot and sexy as Natalia, but she's hotter as Black Widow(The name Black Widow and Whiplash was never mentioned throughout the movie). The director of this movie Jon Favreau is fun to watch as Hogan. The only problem in the cast is Don Cheadles. He's not playing Jim Rhodes, he's just playing his old roles.Iron Man 2 is still a superhero and the point of every superhero movie is the action but here in Iron Man 2 the action scenes were few. The movie has too much dialogue and plots, and few action. It's not a successful sequel but it's a fun movie to watch this summer. Iron Man 1 is still a classic superhero movie!","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","gregyolen","27 April 2010","Summer blockbuster season always brings with it at least one big disappointment. This year's comes right up front – and what a disappointment it is. IRON MAN 2 is a classic sequel in the worst sense: we've got more villains, more heroes, more money in the budget, and none of it amounts to an experience that comes even close to that of its predecessor, which stood out in 2008 as smart, effervescent counter-programming in the summer dominated by the dour DARK KNIGHT.The problems with IRON MAN 2 are bone deep, but they manifest themselves everywhere on the surface. While the first film focused neatly on Tony and his development from careless cad to honorable hero, this sequel gives him nowhere to go, and at some point in the filming/editing, director Jon Favreau must have realized this; hence, his new movie's many secondary characters and subplots receive a disproportionate share of screen time here. Tony is all but discarded as a dynamic character – and it becomes very clear very early that without the original's central arc (and I ain't talking arc reactor, hiyo,) there's really not much novel about this franchise.","8/10"

A perfect blend of a good story line, good acting, action and a touch of humor. Robert Downey Jr is even better in this film.I think after the first film he has just perfected the part of Tony Stark. Don Cheadle as Rhodey was brilliant. I originally did not know what to think when I heard Mickey Rourke would be playing the villain in Iron-Man 2, so i was really happy when he pulled of a stellar performance as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. There were plenty of characters which is good to see in a film, many films have to little characters, but in this film there is many in Tony, Rhodey, Pepper, Nick Fury, Natasha, Whiplash and Justin Hammer. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was amazing but when you think about it what role doesn't Samuel L. play well.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","saintorr","2 May 2010","I was such a big fan of the original movie and had been looking forward to this sequel for a while. Sadly this effort just didn't live up to expectations.That is not to say the movie is terrible or boring but it just missed something.Downey Jr, Rourke, Rockwell, Paltrow and Johansson performing together should have added up to something great but unfortunately it just added up to something that was OK.Hard to identify a single flaw but I got the impression that the film makers started off with a project that was just too ambitious (a cynic might describe it as a project that was too poorly defined).Some of the plot leaps, clunky dialogue and vanishing characters made me think a lot of material had been cut and gaps had been filled with hasty re-shoots.Go and see this by all means.

"Iron Man 2","gritfrombray-1","2 May 2010","I have to laugh at the amount of obviously stupid people who ran this film down and only went to it to find something wrong. I really enjoyed the first installment and it was the best kick off Marvel film to date but it presented an all too 'obviously going to be the bad guy' Stane. But little else to complain about. This film portrayed an unstable Stark played by the masterful Downey and showed his battles with drink, technology and public life in a real watchable fashion. Pepper Potts was wonderful and, as always Paltrow delivers a fine performance. Mickey Rourke was spine shiveringly amazing in his portrayal as Whiplash and was secretly deceptive in his intentions and abilities. Justin Hammer provides comic support too. Terrence Howard is forgotten in the blink of an eye and Cheadle is even better as Rhodie. The whole arms race and the military row over the Iron Man weapon is a great story and there is slow points in the middle of the film but when watched in full it's obvious that the entire film cannot be in fast forward. Nick Fury and Black Widow are played in superb form by Jackson and Johansson, providing blistering support and many surprises. The showdown at end is as always fantastic. The dialogue and action are all in true comic book style and I for one am looking forward to many more like this to come!","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","bowakawa","30 April 2010","The original Iron Man is obviously a hard act to follow; but surprisingly Iron Man 2, just about pulls it off! It revolves around the star ego of Tony Stark, playboy millionaire by day, action hero by night; although this time around he is no longer prone to hiding his identity because he revealed it to the public. This sparks controversy, shocks and outcry through the US government.The acting is superb, Whiplash is very intriguing, when he is actually in it; mostly revolving around his real identity- Ivan Vanko. Robert Downey Jr also delivers a stellar performance as Stark, who's device is not only saving him but killing him also.The special effects are amazing whether it is chopping race-cars in two or Iron Man fighting corrupted robots next to war machine, it is sure to be one of the best visually of the yearOverall, you're in for one hell of a ride, i would give it a seven and a half but it is closer to an eight.","5/10"

In a large proportion of time almost nothing happens or if it happens it is not so important even the villains seem to have a break from everything else to do nothing, everything becomes very slow and I felt like I was watching a Tony Stark's typical day. It also has good moments, as I said the beginning and the end, but I can't get over the fact that I almost fell asleep in the middle. I still like the cast and the introduction of Black Widow was well received, but I can still say that Iron Man 2 is one of the most boring Marvel movies.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","ohroonoko","15 December 2021","Originally scored this a 5 (five!) when I watched this 11 years ago. I don't know why I was so harsh on it, I think it had a lot to do with not liking Mickey Rourke as the villain with his electric whips, or the army of drones that were too similar to Iron Man's suit, or even Sam Rockwell as an antagonist. For sure I was deeply disappointed (and to some degree still am) that Terrence Howard was replaced as Rhodes- but I appreciate Don Cheadle's take on the role. Maybe my expectations were just too high and I wanted a grittier follow up to Iron Man. Whatever the case may be, I just watched it again for the first time in 11 years (as I am watching all the MCU films in MCU timeline order) and I really enjoyed this film. The character development, the character interaction, the introduction of Black Widow, the early Nick Fury appearance, the humor... all in retrospect, this is actually a pretty good installment. And after I watched the deleted and alternate scenes, I got a great appreciation for the editor and director for leaving those scenes on the cutting room floor- it was a good call because those scenes would have negatively impacted the pacing, or been over the top with the corniness.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","mjplysaght","3 February 2017","OK, so this film is considered by a bunch of people to be completely terrible, and while I can agree that there are a bunch of flaws, I wouldn't define this film as god-awful.A lot of things are thrown into the mix only to be resolved by some sort of deus ex machina. To put it short, this is just filler leading up to The Avengers.Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect fit for Tony Stark. He proved himself in the original Iron Man and here, while this film isn't quite as good as the first, he still carries the charm with him, even if Stark is caught in a battle of his own self-destruction.Sam Rockwell plays a tenacious, awkward and irritating rival to Stark in the form of Justin Hammer, another weapons developer, who tries to team up with Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, the son of Howard Stark's business partner(?) whose revenge stems from the Stark family taking credit for the creation of the arc reactor while his family is forgotten about? It's not developed enough.Meanwhile, Tony Stark needs to find a suitable replacement element for his Arc Reactor as the palladium core is slowly killing him. As well as that, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is shoehorned into the film, merely just to establish her presence in the Avengers, rather than HER OWN FILM, which even at the time of writing this, seven years after the film's release, there still aren't any concrete plans.The film is full of red herrings and subplots that get resolves so quickly, that it really makes you ask what was the point of including it in the film to begin with. Also, the action is very short-lived.Putting all that aside, it's cool to see Robert Downey Jr. just be himself as Tony Stark.

The word is out, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is Iron Man and everyone wants a piece of the technology. Unfortunately, Stark isn't the only one capable of building a suit and the others who can, aren't who you want replicating it.REVIEW:
The thing with MCU films is there are always redeemable factors (possibly other than Dark World I've been trying to avoid that for years). The first 30 minutes of this film I love. After that, it starts to go downhill a bit. It doesn't completely go off the rails, but it starts to focus far more on the health of Stark and how the piece in his chest is killing him. Now, I wasn't hating the movie during the middle, but especially when compared to the first film, there was a lot less going on and it didn't keep the same pace that the other films do and to me, it didn't have a good final battle. I honestly felt that Stark had more trouble on the race course (which is one of the best scenes in the MCU) than he had at the end. Granted he had help, but it also ended very soon and there didn't seem to be any real threat to his life displayed in the film. There was more of a threat coming from his chest throughout the film. I know it wasn't the fault of the studio and I like Don Cheadle, but I feel Terrence Howard was a better Rhodey and was more believable in that part. The film wasn't terrible, but wasn't one of the best. I still did enjoy aspects, such as the direction from Favreau, the addition of Agent Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and I loved Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, but I will find myself revisiting the other films far more than this one. 6.5/10.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","aurora_vampiris","22 May 2010","The thing with Iron Man 2 is that people inevitably tend to compare it to the first movie. And there's a minor problem with that. Iron Man - in most regions - released at just the right time. People were downright disappointed with the superhero genre and it appeared to be on the brink of demise after Spider-Man 3 and the X-Men films. Batman Begins seemed to have made a mark, but it was too fleeting and insignificant to be etched in people's memories. Then came Iron Man - it was the first decent superhero movie in ages. People loved it, it spread to engulf the Box Office earnings and bingo - there was a new, awesome superhero in town. Of course, after Iron Man, there was this little film you may have heard of - it was titled ""The Dark Knight."" THAT took the box office by storm. Iron Man, fortunately enough for the franchise, got bunched together with the Dark Knight and came to be fondly remembered as an audience favourite. Unfortunately, the audience has a very short memory span and tends to prize fond memories on some untouchable pedestal in their minds - high above the rest of the ordinary movies that plague our cinemas today. Even if the details of the memory itself are scrubbed out. We still prize that blurred memory and cherish it.Iron Man was not a masterpiece. It was the first brilliant superhero movie in ages, but it was by no means a masterpiece a la The Dark Knight. It built up Tony Stark's character arc brilliantly but it got fairly anemic towards the middle and the action was all limited to the last ten minutes of the movie. Also, apart from Robert Downey Jr, little else stood out in the background. However, comparisons with the Dark Knight are not quite fair. The Dark Knight was a dark, brooding work of art that plants itself firmly in the noir superhero genre. Iron Man, however, is a light- hearted fun superhero movie - literally at the opposite end of the comic-book spectrum. So I shall compare it against the masterpiece (IMO) from the lighter side of the superhero niche - Spider-Man 2.Iron Man 2, ultimately, shares the same fate as its predecessor. It's a solid movie, surpassing the original movie and at times has flashes of greatness, but falls short of the spark that made Spider-Man 2 so great - conflict. Be it Peter Parker's frustration with having to maintain the secrecy of his superhero identity or his sorrow at the loss of Mary Jane Watson, the conflict was what made the story interesting. On the other hand, in Iron Man 2, Tony Stark seems to breeze through his problems by virtue of his sheer awesomeness. Best friend stole my armour? No problem. I'm still awesome enough. I can beat him... eventually. Some maniac managed to recreate my armour, re-programmed all of the US Army's Droid Army? Oh well, looks like I'll have to destroy them with my awesome, awesome armour-driving skills.Don't get me wrong here. Robert Downey Jr is still the most... well... awesome pick to play Iron Man. The fact is Robert Downey Jr IS the main strength of the entire film - his interaction with other characters is what lifts the film and gives it wings. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic. His kinsmanship with Don Cheadle is sufficient enough to pass muster - they look like two friends who've recently exchanged some harsh words, which is as it should be. In short, Robert Downey Jr seems to have made the role his own. He is Iron Man. The suit and him are truly one.The supporting cast is top-notch as well. Samuel L Jackson just raised Nick Fury's bar on my Marvel meter of awesomeness. Scarlett Johanssen seems to have fit into the Black Widow role like a glove. She looks quite fetching in latex and her stunt scenes are very well choreographed. Her physicality is realistic, especially where she punches through an entire goon squad in a corridoor in front of Tony Stark's flustered bodyguard. Comic book fans might be a bit disappointed with her American accent, but then again, Natasha Romanov IS a super-spy fluent in several different languages - it makes sense that she's a bit more discreet in the movie. Mickey Rourke is believable as Ivan Vanko (Whiplash) and seems menacing at the best of times. Jon Favreau is delightful as Happy, Tony Stark's happy-go-lucky bodyguard.But the actor who truly challenged Iron Man in his own movie was unquestionably Sam Rockwell. He was a revelation in Moon, and is a delight to watch here too - his flustered evil corporate honcho act is a stellar performance and seems to be more of a villain than Whiplash himself.The Iron Man armour(s) look amazing and the CGI is brilliant too. In short, the second movie delivers as much as the first... and more.PS: Watch out for the Easter Egg at the end of the movie credits. There's only one word that can describe the awesomeness of that scene, at least for a Marvel comics fan - Mjolnir.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","AD70","30 April 2010","If you like movies with more action and less time being wasted in developing a back-story and detailed character build-ups then this movie is definitely for you.Fans of the comics will probably enjoy the movie more than those of us who are not already familiar with the new set of characters. But things fall into place as the movie develops so it doesn't take away too much from the overall enjoyment.The actors are all pretty good, Mickey Rourke does very well and so does Scarlet Johansson. Don Cheadle seems a little out of place in the beginning (not because of his acting, more because I really liked Terrence Howard in the first film) but as the movie develops he starts fitting the role much better. By the end of the film I didn't miss Terrence so much. Samuel L Jackson could have done with some more screen time, but I feel that they are developing him for the next installment in the franchise.Overall, the film was still Great! With a mix of the humor and fantastic special effects that made the first film so good.Go watch this movie with an open mind, expecting lots of action, some good moments of humor (there were lots of ladies sitting near and around us laughing out loud at many parts of the film so they obviously found it to be pretty good, as did the guys).Everyone's going to be talking about Iron Man 2 and everyone will have their opinions about what they liked or disliked about it (compared to the first installment). Don't miss out, watch Iron Man 2, it will not be a waste of time or money, and join-in on the discussions!","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","MovieMaster_2000","29 April 2010","Once again Tony Stark is back with his Narcissist behavior. This movie was great from the beginning to the end. It is a great super hero popcorn flick, but it's not a great film. I thought that it was very entertaining and I love Tony Stark's personality. I think that Jon Favreau's Iron Man movie series is one of the greatest super hero movie series of all time. It has personality, unlike other super hero movies who try to be serious (And copy the dark knight that succeeded with being serious) but in the end fails because you can't take these kind of Super heroes serious.When they made this movie, they didn't try to make it serious, instead they made it funny and entertaining, like a superhero movie should be (Except Nolan's Batman series). This movie has it's flaws, but it's still great. This movie was as great as the first Iron Man, but this contained more action and I thought that Robert Downey JR and Mickey Rourke was Awesome. This movie is a must see!","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","vikascoder","8 May 2010","I would not say that I had very high hopes riding on this one when I entered the theater, but i was looking for a fun movie to watch on a Friday night. But it was not to be and I walked out of the theater tired, irritated and drained out to the core.The first Ironman was a pretty picture: concise, great build up and action and clear humorous dialogs. Ironman 2 is a mess and looking from the current reviews and rating, a highly overrated one too. Things which did not work for me:1. Such absolutely brain numbing chatter between the characters! Was there any script for the lines? 2. Poor characterization, poor chemistry between the leads 3. Poor production quality: Yes! poor! Scarlett's fight sequence in the building was one of the most laughably staged ones in recent memory 4. Absence of a compelling plot: Well i do not expect every movie to be the Dark Knight, but hey at least you can put a semblance of a non- derivative plot?Mind numbing junk","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","aid_h6","5 May 2010","Just going to get this out of the way. Iron Man 2 does not exceed it's predecessor in any way. The plot is beyond predictable, the acting is great with solid performances coming from all of the leads, and the special effects are good.The plot is simple enough. Jon Favreau clearly played it safe, which at least is better then the disaster that Spider-Man 3 was, but everyone was expecting much more from him this time around. The motivations for almost all the characters don't really make sense (I'm looking at Ivan Yenko and Rhodey here), but it still is enough to move the plot forward at a fairly brisk pace.Unfortuneatly this movie seemed pretty determined to show off all the new gizmos and gadgets Tony had developed in the slight time period between the two movies. As cool as it may have been, that ""oooh ahhh"" effect does not carry a movie.The acting was great, with an absolutely amazing cast giving exceptional performances. Don Cheadle did a great job taking over for Terence Howard, Robert Downey Jr was as amazing as usual and Mickey Rourke was a perfect choice for the antagonist.Strangely enough, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L Jackson had absolutely tiny roles in the movie, more serving as part of a prelude to ""The Avengers"". Why they felt they needed to blow their budget on some big name actors/actresses that they hardly used over a bolder writer I don't know.The effects were good, but still nothing special. I thought they nailed Whiplash (Thank god they avoided the leather outfit that was seen in the comic books), and some of the better action scenes had some great destruction, which we all love of course.If you REALLY liked Iron Man 1, you will like this. If you thought the first was okay, then this is probably a renter for you. Overall this was a passive move by marvel entertainment after a few hits (by the way could you please make another hulk movie?).Oh well, don't come expecting too too much.7/10","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","freewillyfan","2 November 2019","Iron Man 2 is a decent follow up to the first. The cast is great again and there are some fun action scenes. The race scene and the final fight are quite good. Unfortunately there are multiple plots that make the film feel a little messy and the stories just aren't as interesting as the first movie's. We get an introduction to Black Widow in this which is great. Overall there's fun to be had but nothing amazing about this film and it doesn't have the same freshness as the first.6.7/10","4/10"
"Iron Man 2","doorsscorpywag","14 September 2010","Iron Man is a better song than movie franchise. Basically he is a rich guy in a metal suit who gets his ass kicked by the villains and manages to do something sneaky at the end to win. He got his ass kicked in the 1st and he gets his ass kicked in the 2nd. The guy is a loser. He even needed help to win sneaky in this one. In between getting his ass kicked he does some really boring stuff like inventing a new element to save his life and talking to some bloke who was a pirate. The main villain must have stole the pirates parrot at some point in the movie but my attention wandered to a fly crawling up the wall which was more interesting so I am not sure when. The ending sequence stolen from Predator and Terminator was dull and boring and the money spent could have been spent better with perhaps employing someone who knew what the hell they were doing. Nursery school children could come up with a better film than this turd of a movie. None of it made any sense and the actors seemed as bored as I was delivering stupid lines with a look of someone who had just wandered into a a lift after someone else coming out had farted. Some of these people were actually actors once. Gwen Paltry not among them of course. Sad to see them wasting their time with this rubbish.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","dakotadickenson-83457","9 April 2023","Iron Man 2 is definitely one of the most underrated sequels of the MCU. Robert Downey Jr returns once again as Tony Stark/Iron Man after revealing to the world that he is Iron Man, Tony must face new challenges such as the government thinking his suit is a dangerous weapon and wanting him to hand it over, finding a new replacement for the palladium core in his arc reactor that's keeping him alive while also poisoning him, and fighting a new enemy that ties into his family's legacy. Mickey Rourke stars as the villain Ivan Vanko/Whipflash and I highly think his villain definitely doesn't get the credit he deserves. The only problem I really have with his villain is the accent doesn't always hit its mark and he only has a couple of scenes of actual action that doesn't last long at all. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts too as the new CEO of Stark Industries. Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Rhodey and now I can't imagine anybody, other than Don Cheadle portraying the character. The film also gives us a proper introduction to Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury who is the the Director of Shield and Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Overall, Iron Man 2 isn't as great as it's predecessor, but it is a more than solid sequel that gives us plenty to be entertained by. Rating 7.5/10.","8/10"

"Iron Man 2","skullislandsurferdotcom","15 February 2011","Although it's intriguing watching Robert Downey Jr. as millionaire Tony Stark who, with too much fame, money, booze and girls, behaves like Downey did in the nineties (short of waking up in a stranger's living room), this is an action film lacking action.Mickey Rourke makes for a potentially decent villain, but is given two (relatively quick) scenes battling our hero, the metal clad warrior not up for saving the world (but from what, or who?).The lack of a decent heavy is replaced by Sam Rockwell's sleazy arms-dealing senator, given too much dialog in scenes that need more punch.Much like ROCKY IV... a lazy ""champion"" with too much money verses a killer Russian... but even that had more vapidly entertaining comic book appeal, something this needed more of.","5/10"
"Iron Man 2","Smells_Like_Cheese","10 May 2010","Ah, summer blockbuster 2010 has started, and what bigger bang than with the sequel to 2008's smash hit, Iron Man? I really did enjoy the first Iron Man, it was exciting, action packed and different from other super hero movies that we see. Most super hero's hide themselves and stay very introverted in their ""normal human"" disguise, but Tony Stark was something different, he was so alive and colorful and admits pretty much off the bat to the world that he is Iron Man. Naturally he is going to get a lot of challengers in the world and we love to see him take them on as he knows how hot he is and doesn't hide it. So Iron Man 2 is the sequel that everyone who loved the first Iron Man had to see. I admit that I was extremely excited, this looked even better than the first Iron Man. So I got to see it this weekend and I have to say that my friends and I were a little disappointed. Not to say this is a bad movie by any means, it's a good one and very much worth the theater experience, but it didn't have the same ""pazazz"" as the other Iron Man had. Usually most sequels have this part of having to explain the characters, go a little more in depth with them, Iron Man 2 is no stranger to this. Now it can either be good or bad, in this case, Iron Man 2 fell a little short and started to bore me; but it does come back for an awesome ending.Six months after revealing his identity as Iron Man, Tony Stark, has helped maintain world peace. A United States Senate committee, led by Senator Stern, demands Stark release the technology for military application. Stark refuses, declaring that he and the suit are as one while also claiming his competitors are years away from successfully recreating the technology. Afraid of a possible doom he's facing, he appoints his former personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, replacing her with Natalie Rushman. While racing in Monaco, Stark is attacked by Ivan Vanko, who has constructed an arc reactor of his own, along with whip-like energy weapons. Stark defeats Vanko. Afterward, Stark learns that Vanko is the son of his father's old partner. Ivan blames the Starks for his family's poor fate, and seeks revenge. Rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer has Vanko broken out of jail and recruits him to perfect a line of armored combat units he will use to upstage Stark at his own Expo.Mickey Rourke over all does his job well as the main villain of the story, but my only problem is that a lot of his lines I couldn't understand. He has a thick Russian accent that over does it a little too much because I kept leaning over and asking my friends ""what did he say"" and they would respond with ""I have no idea"". Trying to be as intimidating as Ivan Drako in Rocky IV(heck, even their last names look alike) it didn't work as well. Scarlett Johansson was a little dull at first but once again comes back with a vengeance in the end as she has possibly the coolest fight scene in the film. Robert Downey, Jr. as usual does a great job, my only problem being once again, in the first Iron Man, he was confident and smooth, this one he was more cocky and a jerk. I couldn't root for him as much with this sequel. But Iron Man 2 still delivers in the action, the effects are just as cool and really keep you on the edge of the seat. There are some good laughs and over all a decent enough story, it just could have used a little more sparkle I think. But I'm satisfied with Iron Man 2, it gives the audience what it wants and doesn't hold back on the action.6/10","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","flapdoodle64","25 May 2010","This is a fine comic book movie that relies as much on snappy dialogue and characters as it does fight scenes and CGI. IMO, this is a good idea in that with regard to FX and CGI, we have reached the age of overkill.Another interesting departure from modern superhero films: typically such films increase the number of supervillians with each sequel, i.e., Spidey 3 and Batman Forever having 3 supervillians. But no, Favreau wisely chooses to have 1 supervillian here.Finally, Iron Man diverges from current trends in that he heavily relies, even depends, on his supporting cast. Rhodie, Pepper, and Happy all contribute heavily to Our Hero's eventual triumph. I find this refreshing when I contrast it with the monomania of certain popular heroes. Also, unlike Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, there is no attempt to make Iron Man 2 more overpowering, bombastic, mindnumbing and pretentious than Iron Man 1. No, the attempt is simply to make a movie that is true to the characters and scenario of Iron Man 1, and to make the movie fun, interesting, and exciting. In this way perhaps the Iron Man franchise will be like the James Bond franchise, making each film simply another chapter in the life of our hero, rather than trying to make each film a quantum leap in intensity over the previous.And even though Iron Man 2 does not smack you upside the head every 3 minutes trying to tell you how 'deep' and 'meaningful' it is, there is a genuine socio-political subtext to this film that is plain to see if anyone cares to look. The final message is ambiguous and open-ended, but if one follows the threads regarding the interaction between weapons, money and politics, Iron Man 2 is understatedly subversive.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","babzey","1 May 2010","Call me biased if you will, because I admit I was completely taken with the first movie, but I absolutely loved this film. I went into it knowing I would enjoy it either way, but fully prepared to admit it if it wasn't good. There are a lot of people saying this was disappointing. Those people are everywhere, in every board, for every film. Pay them no mind, and I encourage you to go and see this film for yourself, make your own judgement. With amazing effects, and just the perfect balance between character development and action, this movie has it all. It picks up directly where the first one left off, and gives us everything we loved from the first film and then some. The suit got more advanced, the bad guys got badder, and the tension between Tony and Pepper went up a notch. Any loose strings from the first film are tied up nicely, and I'm happy to say that Stark is every bit as egotistical and brilliant as he was in Iron Man. As for Potts, while some complain about her, I really don't see the problem. Pepper is easily the most relatable character, not just in Iron Man, but in every superhero film, as far as female leads go. Comparisons should not influence your decision, because there is no film quite like this one out there, aside from the first installment. A firm ten out of ten from me.","7/10"
"Iron Man 2","tareqzaghal","2 September 2023","When you grow up on the internet, sometimes you have opinions that aren't entirely yours on films you've only vaguely seen as a kid on TV. Years later, you can properly form more concise opinions, and in the case of Iron Man 2 (2010), you are all wrong.Way way way too hated on and overlooked, Maybe it's because of how terrible the Phase 4 films are, but this film is much better than I remember and what people think of it. No, it doesn't concern itself with the future of the cinematic universe more than its main story as people argue, things are organically woven into the expansion that a sequel must present. The history of Howard Stark, Nick Fury, Natasha Romanov, and S. H. I. E. L. D., all feel like natural aspects of the greater world Stark has stepped into.RDJ is still unquestionably the leading force behind these films, he is as charismatic as ever. Don Cheadle is a great recast and much better than Terrance Howard as Rhodey, who didn't possess the chemistry that they needed in this film. Rockwell is underrated as Justin Hammer and needs to come back to the MCU in the Armor Wars show. Rourke is okay as Whiplash, not that interesting but has a cool entrance, the film does shoehorn him a bit too much into the final fight by the end of it with not much necessity.Although it started off really well, especially with the entire Grand Prix sequence, the pacing does fall a bit short after the second act, and the entire last half of this film and the previous one are both much weaker compared to the first half. The suits are well-designed, the action is good, the CGI is still great and holds up.Maybe for some, this film doesn't offer anything new, and that's okay. For me, how the themes of fatherhood and legacy are introduced and emphasised in this film adds greatly to Tony's character development throughout the Infinity Saga. I understand the criticisms that the film faces in terms of boring villains and multiple unrelated storylines, but for me I felt like it was still able to build on Tony's arc and simultaneously expand the universe, and an overall great watch.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","ivo-cobra8","21 October 2015","Iron Man 2 (2010) is not a great sequel to an original superhero Action films from 2008 portrayed on a comic books of Jon Favreau's Iron Man film from 2008. This film still delivers and is not that bad either. It is a good Action comic book superhero film but it is a lackluster sequel film. I am sorry Iron Man fans but it try's to be a good film, but it fails in some points. Robert Downey Jr. gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story. The general excellence of the casting trumps the inarguable excellence of the technology. This is a forgettable follow up to Iron Man and falls short on Part I in every way from its awful plot to its short action sequences, it is an awful movie but in some was it is still a good film. Iron Man 2 was a HUGE disappointment, it's the worst movie out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in my opinion and this sequel is rushed out. Iron Man 2 has lot's of problems I thought the last half got torn apart like it does.The best scenes are still the ones with Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Stark's charm-resistant assistant, Pepper Potts), or just Downey alone. The rest feels like padding, which is something a sleek-suited superhero shouldn't need. Not only that This film was rushed out and it was really too long. This film shouldn't have Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) in it, making a prequel in it. Terrence Howard been replaced by Don Cheadle. Tony acting like a jerk again. On his birthday party been all drunk in an Iron Man Suit, not caring about his company beside Pepper. Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes stealing his suit and getting in to a fight with Tony was the worst idea and scene ever. Than they building weapons in the armor ""War Machine"" that JUST WASN'T RIGHT. This film isn't the best portraying film ever by a comic book, which the original is way better than this film is. Natasha Romanoff lying and spying on Tony was wrong and judging Tony was wrong. Romanoff beats all Justin Hamme's bodyguards while Happy fights in a boxing fight with one bodyguard and barely beats him. While Natasha Romanoff is John Rambo one woman army, kills everyone. Come on guys she knows martial arts but she is not a super invincible woman. She is a human been vulnerable like me and you. In my opinion she stole Iron Man's scenes, Tony should have saved Pepper again and stop the bad guys alone. He had a help ""War Machine ""on the end of the film. I still prefer Iron Man (2008) to this film, sorry. Lame one liners, non stop explosions but no one ever gets hurt (especially not the innocent civilians), and a very predictable story line makes for a dull movie. Iron Man 2 with a lot of problems isn't the worst sequel and it isn't bad at all. It does have scene ways that turn's in to good. It has a good things too in it. Iron Man showed the world just how much energy, rhythm, humor, sincerity, and quality filmmaking and storytelling could be crammed into a Superhero movie that managed to satisfy both longtime series fans and newcomers in search not of the perfect comic book adaptation but merely a well-crafted Summer blockbuster that delivered the goods without sacrificing story. I like Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash I thought he did a perfect job portraying a super villain and arch enemy of Iron Man in this film! Which I personally, think he did a better acting than the rest of the crew did. He is a professional and he can act the way he was told too. The fights between Iron Man and Whiplash on the track race were cool. I really love that. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is a combination of Iron Man's enemy the Crimson Dynamo (Dr Vanko, who wears weaponry/armour that can control electricity) and the supervillain Whiplash (who possesses a specially-designed razor/acid whip). That was awesome of making one of the most memorable super villains portraying by comic book even if it does have a little changes it is still good.I love the songs portrayed by AC/DC, the scores of the soundtrack a perfect to film. Even tough the film was not that good, I still did enjoyed in some scenes. Awesome cast, overpowering budget, & state of the art technology could do so much more, but by looking at the other reviews I'm certainly in the minority. The fights on the end of the film with CGI battling Iron Man with War Machine and successfully destroying the drones were terrific and I enjoyed with that. But that was all.Tough It was a A disappointing sequel and a disaster film I still like it and It was on a way still a good film, but the original was the best. I will still watch watch this film, even though it is a little let down but still watchable.

"Iron Man 2","ddelamaide","28 October 2010","It's to be expected that a movie based on a superhero comic book would have adolescent appeal, but in a period when even animated films have layers of meaning to draw in adult viewers, this sequel comes across as flat and boring for anyone not enamored of Robert Downey Jr.'s childish and self-indulgent portrayal of Tony Stark.I'll admit I couldn't watch it until the end, but the plot is so predictable I guarantee no one could spoil it for me. It's a shame really to see so much talent and money wasted on such thin gruel. The production values are obviously very high (worth four of the five stars in my rating).Downey, I'm coming to believe, has been overrated as an actor (Sherlock Holmes was also dreadful), but it's a shame to see Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansson squander their talents on adolescent pablum. I guess everybody has to make a living.Mickey Rourke is the only one who manages to endow his underwritten role with an enigmatic quality that makes him worth watching, but hardly enough to salvage this film. Enjoy it, kids.","3/10"

I was a little disappointed that terrince howerd wasn't gonna be war machine but Don Cheadle pulled it off wonderfuly, he was the best choice for the role sine it wasn't howerd. Gwyneth Paltrow played a great role as pepper. Scarlett Johansson was hot, slick, and sexy, she was great for the guys to watch, and did a great role of black widow. Samule L. Jackson wasn't in Iron Man that much but he did to good as a nick fury character and think he can pull it off in the new nick fury movie thats supposed to be coming out in 2011. sam rockwell was a great actor in this movie he can really make you hate him, he can play a real ass whole.

"Iron Man 2","ehohertz","9 May 2010","Yeah,there were some plot holes, but who cares... you don't go to this movie to critique the plot.Anywho, the only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was the scene at the end when they didn't OK Tony Stark for the Avengers. Are they covering their bases in case they can't afford to pay Downey for the Avengers or what? Iron Man and/or The Avengers will NOT work without Stark/ Downey! His charisma is what made these movies the best Marvel movies ever made. You can't have the Avengers without Iron Man... you can't have Iron Man without Tony Stark... you can't have Tony Stark without Robert Downey!I sincerely hope Downey signs on for a prominent role in the Avengers, otherwise it will be severely diminished. Casting makes a movie. Downey was perfectly cast and adds as much to his character as Halle Berry took away from Storm, Affleck took away from Daredevil, and Ioan Gruffudd took away from Mr. Fantastic.Not as good as the first, but still the second best Marvel film ever made.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","hindsiteman","10 May 2010","Yet another movie for: the kids, man children, comic book worms, cliché loving public. Everyone else...you're not knowing whats good for ya! This is becoming more and more commercial with each day passing by. How many comic books characters are there? Will everyone get its own movie? I hope not, because Marvel has become stale. It shoves itself on the screen, with the story of some rich guy, army manufacturer, gone berserk and became a guinea pig. In the middle of all that, he crossed a bunch of people including a Russian guy. What? Again with the Russians. Just stop it already. If you can't find a decent villain then maybe you shouldn't make a script. Sure, it was fun like in the comic book during the cold war. I as a viewer don't need to pay to go and see it with my own child and answer him that Russians are bad, because they pointed a nuclear missile in our direction. I don't need to feel bad for my country's politics that led to that, and the picture that stayed in some OLD comic book.RD and Rourke are great actors, but this story could do a makeover.","1/10"

"Iron Man 2","jpachar82","11 December 2010","The old saying goes that when people retire, they don't come back head strong. I disapprove very strongly whoever said that. When Iron Man come on the scene in 2008 as a remake of the original comic book, I said it wouldn't last. I was completely, out-of-my-freaking-mind, THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!!! I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","mack-50","9 May 2010","The anticipation to see the follow-up to 2008's Iron Man was quite high and it was hard to expect anything less than sheer awesomeness. Fortunately the movie delivered in spades and did not fail to impress on most accounts. The Cast: For starters, Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as Tony Stark, the billionaire, egocentric, narcissist CEO of Stark Industries. While initially skeptical before the first movie I could not think of anyone better suited for this roll now and RD Jr. is easily one of the most watchable actors in film today. Gwenyth Paltro is back as Pepper Potts and while her role seems slightly subdued in this film it certainly isn't due to her lack of acting skill which is, as always quite in tact. Seeing Scarlett Johanssen as the striking Natalie Romanoff however was an incredibly welcome treat. I can't help but fall in love with Scarlett nearly every time I see her on the big screen and she performed admirably in the film with a few outright stunning karate style ass-kicking stunts. Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Rhodey and when the change was first revealed I wasn't happy, but if there is any ONE good replacement it would have to be Cheadle. Rhodey's character is a bit cold and calculated even though he is supposed to be close friends with Stark. Sam Rockwell appears in Iron Man 2 as Justin Hammer. A nemesis to Tony Stark on the business front and Sam is always great to watch although somewhat annoying which is what the film was gunning for in his character. I've been a fan ever since I saw him in McG's Charlie's Angels as the evil Sam Knox. I could go on with the cast of characters like Mickey Rourke playing the evil Ivan Vanko, Samuel L. Jackson as Shield's Nick Furty, Gary Shandling as the annoying Senator Stern and even some great cameo's by DJ AM (rest his soul), CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Bill O'Reilly as the Fox no-spin master himself and even G4's super sexy Oliva Munn who were all an absolute pleasure to watch and even more so if you keep your thumb on current pop culture. But I digress.The Story: This time we see Tony Stark suffering from his chest mounted power source that is literally poisoning him from the inside and there is seemingly no cure. A great plot thickener to be sure but not before Tony and Iron Man have a chance to discover there is also another bad boy of technology on the block in the name of Ivan Venko. Apparently the son of an inventor that Tony Stark's father worked with briefly before getting into a nasty bit of business and ending badly many years ago which brings Ivan back for furious vengeance against Stark and team and eventually going to work for Hammer who is trying to secure a contract with the US government for futuristic arms development. All the while the US government is trying to ""acquire"" Iron Man technology for ""safe keeping"" should the nation need to use it while Mr. Stark is off on one of his wild weekend long parties. The part where congress calls in Tony Stark to testify on why he should give up Iron Man technology to the government is particularly entertaining. Issues: While the movie was great in my opinion it was not without a few issues of note. I found it interesting that Ivan Venko arrived at the race in Monaco in order to confront Iron Man yet it was a last minute change that even brought Tony out onto the track. Quite a large oversight for such a high profile movie. Also with regards to Tony Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts. Throughout the movie there was little to no sexual tension or overt attractions between the two. However at the very end they seemed to unnaturally pin the two together for something more serious. It seemed rushed and out of place in my opinion. Closing: With that said I'll leave the rest to imagination and you to see the movie to discover the great storyline, incredible action sequences and entertaining one-liners throughout and let's not forget about the ass kicking sound track officially consisting of all classic AC/DC but with snippets of other great tunes such as Daft Punk's Robot Rock played during an appropriate fight scene between Iron Man and.Oh well lets just save that for the movie shall we? If you enjoyed the first Iron Man I'm fairly certain Iron Man 2 will not disappoint you in the least. Enjoy!","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","poe426","15 May 2010","By far the best thing about IRON MAN TWO is Scarlett Johansson as The Black Widow: her cgi-enhanced fight scenes make this virtual movie virtually worth watching- but it's the lack of any genuine humor (the saving grace of IRON MAN ONE) that makes the running time seem to drag. Downey is capable enough, given what he's given to work with, but watching an addict playing a drunk is hardly my idea of a fun evening. Had the filmmakers opted to say something of substance about substance abuse, one might've been inclined to forgive them the shortcomings of the script (which are legion). Rourke's threadbare role (a reprise, of sorts, of his character in THE WRESTLER) adds not one whit of sheen to his shine: he not only looks like a homeless man, his persona screams it. A true waste.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","SnoopyStyle","7 December 2013","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is back declaring that he has created world peace. The problem is that his arc reactor heart is killing him as fast as saving his life. And then there's Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) who is on a mission to avenge his father with superior arc technology.It's a good continuation sequel. I like Mickey Rourke as the new bad guy. He has the look and the menacing demeanor. I even like the accent. Sam Rockwell is normally a special actor, but his sleazy weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer feels very generic. And Garry Shandling is stupid as a Senator.Overall, it does feel a little bit bloat with the vast number of characters and the complicated history in this movie. There are a few characters they introduce that payoff in later movies. For example, Scarlett Johansson seems like nothing more than a simple T&A show. If not for the later movies, I would say she's a bad distraction.The fact is that it does two things all at once. It's Iron Man 2, but also pre-Avengers. And it does them both well enough. But like a ship with two masters, it can veer off at times. It could have been a great movie that is strictly Iron Man 2. But this is a good enough movie that advances both goals.","3/10"
"Iron Man 2","leplatypus","19 May 2010","From a private point of view, this is our first ""family"" trip since ""Iron Man 1"" and if the first had been a honeymoon, this second is rather an Odysseus. What will happen with the third movie? From a comic fan, I have been hugely disappointed by this sequel.When they cast Rourke as villain, my expectations were low and the actual watching even in Imax didn't get them up. He may be OK for ""Sin City"" but not the marvel way. In addition, the choice for his character Whiplash is dumb because it's like directing a Robocop movie delivering tickets! When you want an amazing movie, you find an amazing bad guy: remember Dark Vador, Terminator or Green Goblin! Then I discovered the second villain: Hammer. Well, it's a crooked businessman so this isn't a choice for action. In addition, his cast is terrible because Sam Rockwell hasn't got any charisma and is always weening.Scarlett Johansson is a fine Black Widow but her involvement is mishandled.Sure, Robert Downey is still the perfect Tony Stark and there are some good moments (the movie with his father, the new armors) but I didn't find the fun I had two years ago! I think Mr. Theroux is a better actor than writer and that he should have stayed on Mulholland drive.In conclusion, it's Iron Man washed and void that you see and it will be the result as long as you give the screenplay to people who are not reading comics as hobbies. Adaptation = No filter!","5/10"

"Iron Man 2","Tweekums","9 May 2011","At the end of the first 'Iron Man' film Tony Stark announced to the world that he was Iron Man; I assumed that this would quickly be explained as a joke and he'd do back to being a standard superhero whose true identity is unknown I was wrong; this superhero wants the world to know who he is and he wants to enjoy his celebrity status. Not everything is going well for Tony though; the senate wants him to hand over his suit to the military and to make matters worse he is slowly dying. Tony is convinced that nobody else is close to developing a suit like his until one day he is attacked by Ivan Venko; a Russian with a grudge against the Stark family. Venko ends up working for a rival arms manufacturer, Justin Hammer, and Tony is approached by a shadowy individual who claims that there is a cure for Tony's condition but only Tony can find it. While Tony sets about finding that cure Hammer is creating a drone army, which ultimately Tony must confront.This was a fun sequel that sets things up nicely for a future superhero franchise; 'The Avengers'. There was lots of explosive action and some delightfully over the top acting from Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and a far more restrained performance as Pepper Potts, his erstwhile assistant now CEO of Stark Industries. Mickey Rourke was suitably menacing as Venko and Don Cheadle was good as Stark's friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes. Of the new characters the biggest surprise came from Scarlett Johansson who appeared to be a straight-laced lawyer but soon proved to be a martial arts expert who may be a superhero herself! Like the vast majority of modern action films this was full of CGI and special effects; thankfully they were well done and the CGI looked believable even when we were being shown the impossible. Overall this was a lot of fun and it is suitable for adults and older children alike.","8/10"
"Iron Man 2","blackberrybabe","1 May 2013","Being a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr., I naturally want to see everything that he is in. When I found out that he was Iron Man, I was intrigued and excited. I loved the first movie and eagerly anticipated the second one. When it came out, I was worried it would not live up to my expectations.I needn't have worried; the movie surpassed my expectation. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect. I just wanted the relationship between Stark and Potts to develop more. I liked that there were links to other Avenger characters, such as the mention of New Mexico and a drawing of the Tesseract. At the time, of course, I didn't make the connection because I hadn't seen any of the other Avenger movies. Now that I have, I look for the hints that are cleverly placed in all films.Robert Downey Jr. once again shines as Tony Stark. You see his vulnerability in this one when he realizes that the palladium heart he uses to stay alive is also what is killing him. Downey, of course, makes Tony real. He makes mistakes and then tries to recover from them. He is arrogant and egotistical, humble and scared. Downey allows Tony to show all of these emotions without making him a caricature. He really is one of the greatest actors of his generation.Returning as Pepper Potts is Gwyneth Paltrow. As in the first film, Potts does not have a lot to do but still needs to be rescued. Paltrow plays Potts well; at one point I wanted to throw something at her for the way she treats Tony. I get that she's irritated by his behavior, but the fact that he's trying to make amends should count for something yet she doesn't think so. Paltrow is perfect.Don Cheadle takes over the role of Colonel James Rhodes from Terrance Howard. I really wanted to hate Cheadle; Howard was so perfect as Rhodey. However, Cheadle did a great job and at times, I forgot that Howard didn't return to the sequel. We get to see Cheadle suit up in this one as War Machine and I loved when both he and Stark teamed up for battle.Academy Award winner Mickey Rourke is Ivan Vankov, a Russian determined to get revenge on Tony for what Howard Stark did to his father. Rourke is convincing as Vankov, carrying the Russian accent perfectly and makes you believe that he really is Vankov. One interesting thing to note is that the beautiful bird that was in the film was at the request of Rourke. He wanted Vankov to have a human side and have love for something, and so the bird was added into the film. This was a risky move that works. Although you know that he's up to no good, you can't help but like him when he requests that his bird is with him when he works.The rest of the cast is rounded out with Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, Clark Gregg and Samuel L. Jackson. Of course, each is wonderful in their roles. It was nice to see Jackson and Gregg return as their characters from S.H.I.E.L.D. and introduce us to Johansson as well. There's a bit of a hint as to who she really is early in the film when she takes Happy down in a boxing move, but you have a tendency to forget that until her alter ego of Natasha Romanov is revealed.Graphics play a huge part in this movie and rightfully so. Tony is an innovator and a step ahead of modern technology. It makes me hope that everything he uses will eventually be in every household in the world. Audi also makes a guest appearance when Tony drives a few of his cars in the film.Many people were worried that Iron Man 2 wouldn't be as good as the first one, but those worries were quickly put to rest. For a sequel, it is everything it should be. Here's hoping the bar is raised even higher in Iron Man 3.","9/10"
"Iron Man 2","zardoz-13","10 May 2010","""Iron Man 2"" ranks as a CGI-riddled, overblown, second-rate sequel. Director Jon Favreau's original Marvel super hero saga delivered a slam-bang, refreshing blend of superheroism and bad attitude on the part of its egotistical protagonist, and Jeff Bridges proved a worthy rival as his treacherous vice president who copied his high-tech armored suit and challenged to the death. While Favreau's ambitious sequel delivers more than enough exhilarating displays of pyrotechnic prowess, ""Iron Man 2"" is neither as nimble nor as engrossing as its spectacular predecessor. Indeed, Iron Man faces a new contender. Thuggish Ivan Vanko isn't as memorable as the sinister Obadiah Stane, but he does appropriate high moral ground as part of his crusade to topple our hero. Meantime, Robert Downey, Jr. is every bit as good as he was the first time around, and he tackles bigger problems in his encore in this follow-up adaptation of a popular comic-book series that came out in 1963. Unfortunately, ""Tropic Thunder"" scenarist Justin Theroux wraps everything up a predictable plot that presents a plethora of complications but few surprises. Some movies suffer from too many characters and too great an agenda. This is what cripples ""Iron Man 2."" The middle section of this 124-minute marathon buckles under the weight of excessive plotting and extra characters before the film recovers sufficiently for a triumphant ending. The action unfolds in chilly Moscow as destitute Soviet physicist Anton Vanko (Yevgeni Lazarev of ""Lord of War"") dies with his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke of ""Sin City""), at his side. While this is happening, the local news contains a broadcast of Tony Stark coming out of his metal closet to admit that he is Iron Man. Before the elder Vanko passes away, he assures his son that Ivan should have been in billionaire industrialist Tony Stark's shoes as Iron Man. As it turns out, Stark's late father Howard (John Slattery of ""Traffic"") and Anton were partners who collaborated on the invention of the arc reactor. Eventually, Anton was deported to the Soviet Union where he managed to scrape out an miserable livelihood. Ivan finds the blueprints that his father created with Howard Stark. He sets about to construct a primitive version of Iron Man's breastplate and adds two crackling fiber-optic whips that can slice through metal as if it were butter. Look out Tony Stark! If Ivan doesn't represent a minor threat in the overall scheme of things, Tony discovers that the very suit that enables him to carry out his vigilante crime fighting exploits is contaminating his blood and gradually killing him. In other words, our hero has got to find a new energy source that won't kill him. Meantime, a United States Senate Investigation committee, headed up by slimy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling of ""What Planet Are You From?""), insists that Stark hand over the technology of his Iron Man outfit to the government for military application. Naturally, Stark doesn't cooperate. He explains that the suit and he are one and that America need not fear anybody cloning his flying suit of armor.Bored with the routine of running his massive corporation, Tony promotes his right hand woman, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow of ""Great Expectations""), as the CEO of Stark Industries. Of course, Pepper is flabbergasted by this extravagant gesture on Tony's part. Our hero flies off to Monaco to race in the Grand Prix and runs into Ivan with his whips. Pepper and Tony's chauffeur Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau of ""Couples Retreat"") careen onto the race course and give our protagonist his suitcase version of his outfit. In no time at all, Iron Man emerges and defeats Ivan. Not long afterward, Tony's worst enemy--rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell of ""Moon"") -- breaks Vanko broken out of prison and cuts a bargain with him to clone Tony's Iron Man outfit. Ivan, however, is no flunky and he embarks on an entirely different program. Instead of replicating Iron Man's outfit, he masterminds an army of drones that Hammer wants to sell to the Pentagon. Stark stages the Stark Expo in Flushing Meadows, New York, to carry on his father's legacy. Anybody who creates a worthwhile contribution to technology can display their handiwork. Hammer unveils his drones, but learns too late that Ivan's infamous scheme supersedes his own plans. The chief problem with ""Iron Man 2"" is its lackluster villain. As Ivan Vanko, Rourke appears appropriately nefarious as a walking, talking tattoo with a grudge against our champion, but he poses only a disposable threat. Mind you, he looks menacing enough, but his lack of charisma is only matched by his absence of hygiene. Now, Ivan's outfit looks more interesting, but Iron Man turns it against him in no time as he does the drones. Basically, Ivan combines Iron Man's adversary the Crimson Dynamo and the super villain Whiplash. Sam Rockwell's buffoonish second string villain qualifies as expendable. On the other hand, comedian Garry Shandling virtually steals every scene that he has as a Congressman, particularly the last scene when he decorates Tony Stark for saving the country from Ivan. Sexy actress Scarlett Johansson shows up as Natalie Rushman, a mysterious undercover female commando who can handle herself skillfully in combat with men. Don Cheadle takes over the role of Lieutenant Colonel ""Rhodey"" Rhodes from Terence Howard. Rhodes takes one of Tony's Iron Man outfits because he doesn't want his friend to have a monopoly on world power. She replaces Pepper since Tony promoted Pepper upstairs. Favreau gives actor Samuel L. Jackson more screen time this time as Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but this character does little more than act as a press agent the eventual ""Avengers"" team-up movie. Unfortunately, this installment generates neither enough excitement nor irony to overwhelm its own inertia. Anybody who walks out before the long end credits conclude their tedious roll will miss a brief scene where our hero's new antagonist leaves his calling card in a huge pit.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","Quinoa1984","7 May 2010","Jon Favreau is out to make a good comic-book summer popcorn movie with Iron Man 2, no more no less. Anyone expecting the super dark out of this film lime the Dark Knight need venture along to something else (for one, Nolan's own Inception, but that's not here nor there). We once again have Tony Stark, the man and self-made legend, who is unique among superheroes as he 'came-out' as it were at the end of the first film as being in fact Iron Man. He now has to deal with other things, such as the government wanting, telling, him to hand over his technology for defense (""I have just privatized world peace"" is a keeper of a line), and his heart and soul Pepper Potts, and other new things, such as prickly competition in Justin Hammer, a hot red-headed secretary who can kick ass (and other things)... oh, and his father's legacy and the possibility that his technology for his heart may kill him.So as you can imagine, Stark is not quite at the top of his game. He can still kick ass as Iron Man - when the suit is in close proximity - but his nearly-close-to-deathness and still cleaning up after Stark company mistakes (such as the gnarly Russian cold-war leftover Ivan, aka 'Whiplash', played with gnarly gumption by Mickey Rourke), make him even more of an egotistical jerk than usual. This is what Favreau makes interesting: Stark has grown over time, but the obstacles in his path really knock him for a loop despite always putting a slightly self-deprecating and sarcastic face on things (or, other times, drunk-off-his-ass face on things, which brings Rhodey to become a ""War Machine""). What does a hero have to do to still be an extravagant billionaire out in public and not have to suffer fools trying to crib his technology? Stark's complexity carries the dramatic weight (if sometimes not quite as much as before; the midpoint becomes a little sluggish, though certainly not unwatchable when Sam Jackson comes on screen as Nick Fury), and Downey Jr still makes him one of the most fascinating and just plain f***ing fun superheroes around. Tony Stark is someone you'd love to hate if he weren't such a lovable louse. He's a womanizer and doesn't put on airs, but he deeply cares more about things that do matter than most, and Downey is able to balance out that snark and sense of humor of things with more heartfelt moments like with Paltrow's Pepper Potts (watch those scenes where he offers her the CEO position and then near the end when... well, don't want to spoil that, but they are touching). The new additions to the cast help a bit as well: Rockwell has some fun playing a one 1/2 dimensional slimeball of a politico, and Rourke gets to grit and act gnarly with the best of them as Whiplash. And Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Romanoff... woof.Oh, and the action is still high-flying and exciting and has some surprises in store for the audience (others like the 'ex-wife' actually, pleasantly, underwhelm as irony), and Favreau is able to still manage getting in the humorous beats in those intense moments of action and daring-do. While not every joke hits or line connects, enough do to keep things going on; Favreau even has fun with himself in the Happy Hogan role in a fight scene that is just about perfect for him. The biggest problem though is the allusions - no, wait, flat out references - to the upcoming Avengers movie and other tie-ins to the Marvel universe. In the past it was a little more subtle (a SHIELD joke near the end of the first one, and a cameo of Stark in Incredible Hulk notwithstanding), and in this they are crowbared in a few scenes, albeit one involving Captain America is very funny.But look, this isn't Shakespeare, and it isn't necessarily trying to up the ante on the first one (though, frankly as one of the truly great comic-book adaptations, what could), but it kicks some ass and gets some laughs and assembles a top-shelf cast for a script that's worth the time and money and energy. It's a nice kick-start: the summer of 10 is here.","5/10"

As of now, the Golden Raspberry Awards is the worst thing that the movie industry has ever done. Seriously?!! Transformers 2 was the best movie of 2009, hell, I even got the DVD for my birthday!!! And you scumbags out there didn't even pick ""Old Dogs"", ""Land of the Lost"", ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"", or ""All About Steve"" hell, even Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 for that award!! But no, you're just too stupid to do so and picked my all-time favorite movie.The people of the Razzie Awards are just a bunch of lame ass people who have no acclaim for movies. I'm pretty sure that Michael Bay threw his Razzie Award in the trash can for what they've done.I know a lot of Transformers fans out there in the world are probably mad from what they've seen. They'll probably rant on them pretty soon if they get a chance to do so. I mean, Transformers 2 for Worst Picture? That is just sad. Transformers 2 haters can shut up for a while. I prefer this movie than ""Alvin and the Chipmunks 2"" because that movie has one of the worst endings I've seen.Seriously, the Razzie Awards sucks now, because of this. I'm going to give them two middle fingers for saying that. Transformers 2 gets two thumbs up as well.The bottom line: Golden Raspberry Awards SUCK!!!!! Now, it's time for the Iron Man 2 review.It stars Robert Downey Jr., Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L Jackson, Mickey Rourke etc.With the world now aware of his dual life as the armored superhero Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military. Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts, and James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes at his side, must forge new alliances - and confront powerful enemies.I actually enjoyed this movie more than Alvin and the Chipmunks 2.Both Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Iron Man 2 are AWESOME.After that long rant and a short review, the movie's a must-see.Iron Man 2 gets 10 stars.","6/10"
"Iron Man 2","TheEmulator23","10 May 2010","This was extremely mediocre in the biggest way a film can be. The story. It's barely there at all. Everything about the film was top notch, the acting the special effects, the set pieces etc. However it just goes to show that unless you have a good story & a good script, there is something missing. You never get invested in the story even for a second. That was what made the first film what it was, a really fun & engaging storyline. This had absolutely none of that whatsoever. It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't good. The word of mouth on this will spread (badly) & I would be shocked if this makes as much as the first film which relied on the excellent word of mouth to make it such a successful & very well reviewed film. It seemed like they really should have made the script the most important part of the film. Mickey Rourke did the best he was given, but he just wasn't an interesting/scary bad guy at all. Especially comparing to Jeff Bridges of the first film. I wish people would stop comparing this so much to the first film & stop rating it so high based on that film. If you hadn't seen the first, it doesn't hold up well as a standalone film. In fact if this was the first ""Iron Man"" It would be doubtful we would have seen a second film. On a good note Robert Downey Jr. is good to an extent, but they should have let his own personality shine through even more as he is the reason people love the character. Unless you're a die hard ""Iron Man"" fan you will find little to want to watch this more than once.","8/10"

Expcept he has a reason to be resentful of Tony Stark and I liked this twist that the supposed bad guy actually had a real moral reason to fight the hero. Then again he doesn't come across as really wanting to kill Robert Downey Jnr which lessens the movie's impact.This twist is cut by a script that has been rushed together following 'Iron Man's success. Wish it had been better.","2/10"

"Iron Man 2","m-p-carpenter","7 May 2010","unbelievable sequel that, in the eyes of this viewer, far exceeds the original. Though I don't dare compare the film to ""The Dark Knight"", in comparison, ""Batman Begins"" focused too much on telling us who Batman IS and less on an action adventure we can sit back and enjoy, much like the 2008 Iron Man. With the DK and Iron Man 2, we have passed all the introductions and we can really enjoy many more characters and action sequences (not to mention all the special effects!). Mickey Rourke was phenomenal and the only regret there was that his character did not appear in the movie MORE! Midnight showing was totally worth it, especially with all the little HINTS you can pick up if you know enough about other superhero characters that may be involved with upcoming story lines.","10/10"
"Iron Man 2","steppeck","9 June 2010","I enjoyed Iron Man 1. I enjoyed the fact that the main character was brought down to earth with a big nasty bump, confronted by the reality that he sponsors, and that sponsors his reprehensible lifestyle.That the sequel should suggest that this lifestyle he 'enjoys' is to be endorsed and aspired to, automatically places it into the category of artless social propaganda. It is, essentially a tale of unlikable people with the power of life and death over others, battling it out for the right for that power. Yes, Starks realises his dad loved him really, and that he really ought to cut back on the partying, knuckle down and join the 'team America' and and fight the 'bad guys'. Those bad guys? Well, we'll see who they are in Iron Man 3. Probably some other desperately impoverished group who are misled into believing that they can actually fight against the obscenely rich and powerful of this world. The fools. See Chris Morris' film 'Four Lions' for their story...","4/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","danielmanson","23 November 2019","It's good. I had no idea what to expect in all honest. I am not huge fans of other movies by these actors, but this really worked. You could see the great chemistry between them all and it paid off.What I liked: I enjoyed how it didn't dither about at the beginning and got right into the action. Jack Black especially was brilliant and hilarious! All the actors/actresses were great but Jack Black stood out. Good mix of action and comedy throughout. I was on the edge of my seat (metaphorically) wanting them to escape the game.Negatives: not many to be honest, couple of scenes were slightly cringe, but not off putting. Same logic goes for a couple of scenes which felt dragged out.I think people need to forget about this being a remake of a classic film and treat it as a separate movie altogether. If you start comparing the 2 that's when it goes wrong.Ps.. Karen Gillan. Marry me please?Worth watching and will be going cinema for 2nd instalment.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Her-Excellency","7 April 2018","Who would have thought that the sequel to a much-loved classic would, in my opinion, turn into such a stand-alone powerhouse!?!Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle, does just that. Not only is it a virtual non-stop ride of hilarity and laugh-out-loud moments, and it is, but the chemistry among the adult cast members is practically flawless and lends to the easy banter and overflowing, genius, COMEDIC DIALOGUE which just SHINES. Every look, every gesture, every note from The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are perfection in that at no time do you doubt they are who they are supposed to be. Karen Gillan is adorable and gorgeous at the same time. The obvious fun they are having, despite what I imagine to be uncomfortable filming locales, is palpable, and as an audience member, _if you allow yourself to be_, you WILL be swept up and transported by it.So, why ANY low ratings?While the first Jumanji was 'fun', underneath the fun, there were dark layers. There is none of that here and perhaps, this is where some of the disconnect from its detractors comes from. Unlike the original Jumanji, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a fun, and funny, film throughout. In closing, quite to the contrary of what a couple of reviewers are saying about Robin Williams, such as: 'he'd be rolling over in his grave (over this movie)', Robin Williams was one of those rare and amazingly special individuals who found joy and humor in most everything, and who chose to share that with those of us who are lucky enough to be witness to some of the favorites he left behind. Personally, I find it in very bad taste and verging on offensive, that those who seem to not share the capacity to laugh or live the way he did, or the ability to laugh with the rest of us, and who lack the gift of both being able to give or receive the very humor which exuded from Mr. Williams, would dare say he would be doing anything other than laughing riotously while munching on some popcorn and watching this film.Thank you, Robin Williams, for the precursor which was so fantastic, it brought about an equally wonderful sequel.You are missed.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","AlsExGal","14 September 2020","Four high school students serving after school detention discover an old cartridge video game in the school's storage area. It's called ""Jumanji"" and when they play it, the game sucks them into its world, where they each inhabit a different character: nerdy Spencer becomes Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), a musclebound action hero; football jock Fridge becomes diminutive sidekick Mouse (Kevin Hart); vacuous pretty girl Bethany becomes chubby middle-aged male scientist Prof. Oberon (Jack Black); and academically-driven Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) a sexy martial artist. The quartet learn that they have to complete the game to return to the real world and their real bodies, but they each only have 3 lives in the game; die 3 times in the game, and they die for real.I saw the original Jumanji movie back in 1995 and liked it a great deal and I was therefore dreading how a reboot would taint the memory of the original. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The dichotomy of the characters in their real lives versus their in-game personas is funny and well exploited, and the conventions of video game storytelling and set-up are also lampooned with some wit. Johnson, Hart and Black are all performers who can be over the top, but the material calls for it here, and they all exceed, as does Gillan, especially during her hilariously awkward ""seduction"" scene. Even if some of the animal peril is blatantly more CGI cartoonery, it also fits with the videogame milieu. This strictly popcorn fare, but it isn't brainless, although it's a bit predictable. Still, it was much better than expected.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","markovd111","2 November 2019","When I saw new ""Jumanji"" movie is in the works and saw how does it look like, I was pretty irritated. I didn't see the need for it and couldn't possibly see it at the same quality and style as the first one. Expectations sank even lower when I found about the cast. And then, 2 years later, I finally watched and, surprise, it's fun. It isn't something that will make you rolling on the floor from laughing or make you cry, but it's an enjoyable ride, actors actually aren't bad and wooden, so you will find yourself grinning a lot, particularly at the male part of the cast, which is awesome, especially Kevin Hart. Watch it with a good friend or a loved one and enjoy. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not just a dumb Hollywood blockbuster either. 8/10","8/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Jack_C_","24 December 2017","We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake. The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish at the beginning of the movie, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.The Rock is always fun, but shines as a scared nerd with no confidence. Karen Gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl. Jack Black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny. Kevin Hart as a shrunken jock with many assigned weaknesses is classic. All in all a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor. Worth the trip to see it on the big screen. You do not have to see the original to appreciate it. Not quite 10 stars because adult re-watch value is just not there.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","TheLittleSongbird","20 May 2018","Will admit to not expecting much. The advertising didn't have me completely sold, was worried as to whether it would be fun or turn into puerile immaturity and wasn't sure about the cast entirely. Saw it anyway being someone who wanted to see as many 2017 films as possible, who has seen their fair share and likes films intended to be escapist fun, who loves the Jumanji premise and who has fondness for the Robin Williams film.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' turned to be much better and far more enjoyable than expected. It may not be a masterpiece or great, but it clearly strived to be glossy escapist fun and succeeded very well in that. Do prefer the earlier film but other than the title and the basic premise 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' to me seemed like its own take and should stand on its own. Can see definitely why it won't appeal, and hasn't appealed to (though on the most part have seen more positivity than negativity), some. Didn't care for the first twenty minutes or so in the real world. It didn't have an awful lot of momentum in a first act that was just setting things up and took too long to do so, was awkward at times in the writing and the acting was far more comfortable and interesting once we got to Jumanji. Most of the performances are fine once the film got going, but for me Nick Jonas was very bland and while more subdued than he usually is Kevin Hart for me sometimes grated (though at other points he is amusing), the rapid loudmouth shtick is going to be a very acquired taste. However, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' was highly successful in its aim of being glossy fun escapism. The film is two hours but once we're in Jumanji they fly by. Although the story can be extremely predictable and the outcomes not surprising, the lively energy, the exciting thrills, thrilling action and suitably nail-biting but not intensely so sense of peril more than compensates.As do the witty script, that has the right dose of humour and surprising heart and even with the profanity from Hart it doesn't ever get too crude or puerile, and ace visual effects. Jumanji is colourfully rendered and mostly the film is nicely shot and more than capably directed. The music is rousing and pleasant to listen to and the ending is cosy and surprisingly poignant, which one doesn't expect yet it doesn't jar too much. There's even a nice Robin Williams/Alan Parrish tribute/homage touch, that is worth looking for if especially observant.Dwayne Johnson smoulders in intensity and charisma, in terms of acting style it is very familiar territory for Johnson but he does it well and that's all that matters. Karen Gillen more than holds her own with the other leads, with a good deal of sass and charm (her flirting/dance scene after being taught to do it is one of the film's highlights). Bobby Cannavale is suitably formidable villain, if somewhat underused. Absolutely agree with everybody who says that Jack Black steals the show, he has the funniest lines and moments (which are plenty) and it is perhaps his best performance since 'School of Rock'. The character interplay, which the film is heavy on, really sparkles.In conclusion, fun and surprisingly good film if not a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox","7/10"

Bethany turns into Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black) and Martha into scantily clad fighter Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan).This is simply fun. There are good laughs. The chemistry of the four leads are amazing. The Rock and Kevin Hart have been here before. Their charisma is off the charts. Jack Black is great playing a girl and he has a great scene teaching Gillan to flirt. Karen Gillan has the quirky comedic skills in a super cute package. The only squeaky wheel is Nick Jonas. I'm not convinced of his acting skills. In that smaller role, it would be amazing to have a big cameo like Sly or Schwarzenegger. Nick Jonas is both stiff and lacking. It's a smaller role and a small problem. All in all, this is great fun for the family.","8/10"

I'm thankful for this as I'm tired of the senseless reboots, seriously enough already.With a fantastic cast who are all bringing their A game Jumanji is a very generic Hollywood movie. What I mean by that is its predictible, it's flashy, it's loud and has all the usual tropes that you'd expect.Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's entirely a bad thing, at least it has fantastic production values but sadly it means it lacks in originality and has no real identity of it's own.Telling the story of 4 teenagers who get pulled into Jumanji, yet this time it's updated and has become a video game!Plenty of comedy, both hit and miss, the stunning Miss Gillan on show and Jack Black for the first time in years actually reminding us why we used to love him.It goes without saying that I prefer the first movie but credit where credit is due Welcome To The Jungle did exceed my expectations as I think I subconciously went in expecting and perhaps wanting to hate it.Nothing special, all flash with little filler.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","mike48128","29 August 2018","In 1995, the board game ""Jumanji"" resurfaces in the USA once again. Never mind that originally it washed up from the ocean in France at the end of the first movie. It ""morphs"" into a Play Station-like self-contained video game and a teen-aged boy is sucked into it and becomes a helicopter pilot. Twenty-one years later, 4 teens get sucked into it again. This time, it is a jungle-themed adventure game with a rather-thin ""plot"" which follows silly video game protocols. Each player has 3 lives and special strengths and weaknesses, which they can view and sometimes control. Many twists and turns. The 4 ""gamers"" are transformed into new avatars. Two of them are almost ""invulnerable"". One is a Tarzan-like ""Indiana Jones"" and a gorgeous babe combining the charms of ""Laura Croft"" and Marvel's ""Black Widow "". Both can perform impossible leaps and bounds, like superheroes. A nerdy girl turns into a boy nerd (Jack Black). All are chased (and some are killed) by dangerous jaguars, ""man-eating"" hippos and rhinos. One gets blown up by explosive food, jumping to their death, etc. All are restored by their extra lives. Much ""tame"" mostly non-graphic video game violence, no cuss words, and the ""feeling"" that everything will turn out fine in the end. They are helped along-the-way by various ""guides"" and the magical powers of a luminous green gem that creates evil and yet returns everything back to normal when it is returned, similar to ""The Temple of Doom"" concept. Uttering the word ""Jumanji"" ends the game. The original player returns to his own timeline and so does everyone else. ""Jimanji 3"" is planned, and I don't really see a reason for it as the game is destroyed at the end of this movie. Perhaps magic or cursed things are ""immortal""? Look for ""Jumanji 3-The Search for More Money"" (my title) in 2 years.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Kirpianuscus","30 May 2019","The wrong idea - to compare with the adaptation of 1995. Because it is not better or worst but different. Proposing a decent solution, far to be original, mixing humor and adventure , using the dream of many teenagers to become the better version of theirs and a good dose of special effects. Jungle, not awful dialogues, good performances and exploration of a familiar universe. Nothing memorable. But enough for a not boring afternoon and, maybe, for the inner child. It is fun and the cast represents the basic source of seduction.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Jared_Andrews","23 January 2018","The steady and impressive box office success is well-deserved. This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018.  No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting.  Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. ""Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!"" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much. Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.
 
Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch). Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car ""why can't you just drive us where we need to go?"" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is. Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with ""I'm just saying you're a babe."" Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short. These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","themovieparadise","22 December 2017","All of the performers are fantastic in this film, and are perfect fits for their roles. The group dynamics are excellent, and they all have hilarious back-and-forths with each other. Some of my favorite moments in the movie are when everyone is simply standing around talking. Dwayne Johnson really shows his comedic talents here. While he does have a few scenes where he gets to show off his action chops, most of his role is comedy-heavy, and he delivers on it. Kevin Hart plays the same character he always plays, and more times than not it annoys me, but for whatever reason here it works. Maybe it's his chemistry with the other actors, but he's hysterical in this movie. I'm not a huge fan of Karen Gillan's character of Nebula in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, so I wasn't sure how she was going to be in this. But she delivers as well. Not only does she nail the action beats (and she has some of the best in the whole movie), but she also has some great comedic moments, comedy that I didn't know she could pull off as well as she did. But the true star of this movie is Jack Black. I thought he was hysterical in the trailer, but I was afraid that the concept of him actually being a teenage girl would get old and annoying quick, but it doesn't. Black is perfect for this role, and nails every comedic moment he's given. They are all fantastic together, and it makes for some great entertainment...","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","vengeance20","23 December 2017","Heard about another Jumanji Film being made, but thought it was going to be a remake of sorts. Well, through years of development it seems to be more of a different take on the 1995 classic! And a good take it was!Starting at 1996, a young man finds a ""board game"" on the beach after hearing the iconic ""jungle drums"" sound emitting from the box partially covered in sand. Like the original, he finds it, takes it home with him, & then finds out it's an Nintendo like game & plugs it into his console & starts playing, he gets sucked in & is trapped in the game, similar to the original, but as a computer games console, not a board game, interesting take.So fast forward 21 years later, & 4 young teens who all come together via detention play the game & get sucked in after finding it in a store room in the school. It's then they find themselves in different bodies & each have 3 lives like that of a computer console game. They then learn of the curse of the jungle via a green jewel & must place it back where it was & shout ""Jumanji!"".The film I thought was pretty good! Of course it wouldn't be nearly as good as it's counter back in '95, but it's pretty damn close to be an original & somewhat is! The story was simple & easy to follow, the characters were great & likable, Karen Gillan was a babe in this film! (sorry had to say it!), but she & the others were great! I also liked the humour in this film too! It was funny & fitted well!I was kind of peeved it wasn't set in the real world as appose to a jungle, but I suppose it was because they were sucked into a different world so it made sense in a way, & it wasn't too bad either!Overall this film was a good watch & matches pretty well with the original film! 9/10 Go watch it!","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Tweekums","30 June 2019","This film opens with the viewer being introduced to the four high school protagonists who find themselves in detention together. They are; Spencer Gilpin, an intelligent but shy boy; Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson, Spencer's friend who is a football player needing academic 'help' who are caught cheating; Bethany Walker, a popular girl who used her phone in class and Martha Kaply, an academic high-flier who doesn't see the point of physical education... or PE teachers. Once in detention together they are left alone in a room and find an old games console. The hook it up to a TV and select their characters... then they find themselves sucked into the game in the bodies of their characters. They also gain their characters' allotted skills.Somewhat inevitably their new in-game avatars are rather different to their real world characters. Spencer finds himself in the body of man-mountain Dwayne Johnson; Fridge ends up as Kevin Hart, no longer a great athlete but with knowledge that the team will need; Bethany is perhaps the most shocked when she becomes Jack Black and Martha finds herself in the scantily clad body of Karen Gillan... complete with martial arts skills. They soon meet a character who gives them their task... if they are to exit the game they are to return a gem to the statue it was stolen from. If they are to escape they will need to adapt to their new strengths and weaknesses and work as a team as they face a variety of challenges. It helps that they each have three lives but it is far from clear what happens if they lose the third... although they assume it means real death.I haven't seen the original 'Jumanji' but thought this would be worth checking out as the concept sounded fun and the four lead actors have all impressed me in the past. They may be very different but the film this made me think of was 'The Breakfast Club'; not just because it involves students in detention. Like that film it shows the characters are more than their stereotypes; something they learn when they suddenly find themselves forced to as characters very different to their own. The cast are all on great form and provide many laughs. It was great seeing Dwayne Johnson playing a slightly wimpy character and it was hilarious seeing Jack Black as a high school girl! Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan really impressed as well. The action was solid with good CGI making it look real. The villain didn't have much of a character but that makes sense given that they are meant to be in a game... all the non-player characters are comically limited in what they say and do. The spectacular Hawaiian countryside is used to great effect to make the land of Jumanji. While there are no real surprises the story is a lot of with its impressive mix of action, humour and great characters. The humour mostly avoids crudeness... even the idea of a high school girl coming to terms with her new male body is dealt with in a way that is unlikely to offend too many people. Overall I'd definitely recommend this fans of 'Indiana Jones' style action.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","veeresh1209","6 April 2018","Reboots can be tricky. While some click, most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie. Last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like Jurassic World, The Mummy, Kong: Skull Island. But much like Spiderman: Homecoming, Jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers. 
Jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game. Four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention. Here they discover the Jumanji video game and enter the world of Jumanji as their avatars. Then starts the fun ride. There are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from Alex's freak house. The movie uses time tested cliche - Four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when (literally) seen from some other's point of view. But the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them, at least till the movie ends.The movie does not take itself seriously, and that is a huge plus point. The plot of the movie is crazy, there are man eating albino (what?!) rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side. But such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself, which makes you fall in love with it more.The bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors. All of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry. Jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters. Parts where Dwayne Johnson(Spencer) stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits. Not to mention his hilarious display of 'smoldering intensity'. Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart and Jack Blake as a women in a man's body is perfect. Karen Gillan, who is this mean Nebula in MCU, comes up with a very charming performance.All in all, Jumanji is a movie that you can watch without any regret. It will make you gasp, wonder and laugh hysterically. It is definitely worth a watch.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","dontpanik","9 December 2017","We went to see this as part of the early screening for Amazon Prime members. I always worry that all the funniest parts of a movie are spoiled in the trailer leaving nothing left in the film. That isn't the case. I was either smiling or laughing the entire movie, as was the rest of the theater. Is it Citizen Kane? No. Was I going to the theater wanting to watch a drama that delved deep into the characters' lives? No, again.Our 4 heroes are sent to detention where they discover and are consequently sucked into Jumanji. They become the avatars they chose for the game and must complete the object of the game without using up all their lives. They have to work together, as a team. It is so much fun. It's predictable, funny, cute and the most important, entertaining. The actors are great in it, including a few cameos that were unexpected. The humor isn't too crude, but still slapstick-y and funny. It was along the vein of Shrek, Rat Race, or Clue. Again, if you're looking for deep and can't stand watching a movie without questioning everything, skip this one. This is one of those movies I'll be buying just so I can put it on and laugh.","10/10"

The girl is hot, Jack Black ""owns it"", I've never been overly enthused about Kevin Hart, but he was fantastic. and The Rock just knocked it out of the park. I saw one review which reads: ""not a wrestling fan ever so to see 'the rock' in movies, instantly puts me off!"" Does anyone else want to vomit at the inanity, irony and ludicrousness of that statement? Then you have the user who out of 40+ titles he/she has reviewed in the past has only ever rated TWO above three stars. Seriously, if you don't enjoy films and find them so terrible, find a new hobby already. You've got one guy saying the shirt one of the kids wore was outdated. So, I'm guessing one can only wear clothing depicting the current year? Then you have the reviewers who maybe didn't understand the dialogue since they can barely communicate correctly themselves (such gems - I kid you not - as: 'averege'; 'what so ever'; 'family fair' (fare); 'are just wasn't'; 'due to it has'; 'all of there' {their); 'coz it is boring story'; 'no compare with'). Finally, you have the maybe half dozen reviewers who are so caught up in their bigotry that they can't relax and enjoy a film if it isn't whitewashed and who complain about the ""Hollywood liberal agenda of diversity"". Leave the politics at the door, man.
In short, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle was a fantastic hour or more of rip-riding fun and laughs.Except for one very funny moment, Dwayne Johnson retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead, provides a smoldering and intense performance, riddled with good-natured hilarity as the lead in this film. Gillan was great in Doctor Who, and although I thought she was the weakest of both characters and actors in this film, she still held her own and looked fantastic doing so. She has one of those faces you can't help but love. Kevin Hart was fantastic as the diminutive valet and looking back, I think he was somehow involved in every funny moment in which I laughed the hardest. Finally, the master, the maestro (though I never really was a fan prior to this), Jack Black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection.10/10 and definitely a film I will be purchasing right after I click ""Submit"". You can never have enough laughter in life, and Jumanji, Welcome to the Jungle delivers barrels-full.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","damianphelps","7 March 2021","I will admit from the outset I was concerned about this. The original Jumanji is pretty incredible and I was worried that the use of The Rock may distract from the clever elements of the film.
To The Rock's credit it doesn't. You clearly notice him in it but he doesn't overpower the film.The sidekicks are a big part of the success here, it allows for more depth and humour to be spread across the film.The should be proud of the effort here in building a new legacy and not diminishing the original.Fun for all :)","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","MajorMAlice","13 March 2018","I would say I gave it a 10 to balance out the bobo-heads with no funny-bone in their body's low scores, but no; this movie deserves a 10 and more. Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a stand-alone, HILARIOUS romp which leaves the original in the dust. Heck, HILARIOUS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. Note that this is not to say that the original Jumanji was bad. On the contrary, it was great, especially for when it was filmed and who better than SIR Robin Williams, but in terms of laugh-out-loud good fun and non-stop smiles, this Jumanji far outpaces and outdoes the original. While my BF and I have somewhat different tastes in movies, and he is not a Rock fan (he loved him as a wrestler, not so much as an actor), we both laughed SO MUCH while watching this. The Rock knocks it out of the park with equally stellar performances by Jack Black and Kevin Hart. What is even more fabulous is that it has kids humor, yes, but also 'thinking-people's humor' in the form of obscure little tidbits which are dropped here and there and keep you on your toes and grinning ear-to-ear. There is hardly any scene where you step out of the roller coaster ride of fun it sets you on from the moment they (and you) are IN Jumanji.Do yourself a favor. Watch this, and if you don't laugh raucously at LEAST six times, seriously, consider what else might be wrong. In fact, if you read through some of the negative comments, you see the same old, bored, stagnant people complaining about it being ""too PC"", AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. Cry me a river. If you notice these people's other reviews, it is easy to see that anything that they consider too scary (read: progressive) to fit in the mold of their little minds and world, automatically gets relegated to the 1/10 pile. Shame.In closing, this Jumanji gained a place within my favorite movies of all time, and the only thing which makes me sad about it, is that 1. I wonder if upon a fourth viewing (we saw it three times) through my 20th it will lose some of its luster; and 2. that it wasn't much, much longer, as I did not want the fun to end.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","davispittman","31 December 2017","I'll start out by saying that my family is a really big fan of the Robin Williams/Bonnie Hunt Jumanji movie, I personally thought it was alright. Nothing great, but not bad either. I went into this movie with my doubts about it's quality. One, because I wasn't the biggest fan of the original, and two because I was fearful it would just be another generic action romp. I was WRONG. This is one of the best action films I've seen in some time, and there are many reasons as to why this one works so well. Reason number one: the casting. This cast is just perfectly put together. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson really was great in the lead role, one of his best performances in my opinion. Kevin Hart serves as the ever hilarious comedic relief, and he did a fabulous job of making the audience laugh their asses off. Jack Black is really great here as well, very funny, really the best middle aged man in Hollywood you could pick to play as a teenage girl stuck in another body. And lastly, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas give fun entertaining performances. The acting is a big plus for this movie. Reason number two: the writing. The script allows for many things: comedy, action, and some serious stuff too. Funny lines for the comedic heavyweights and more touching/sweet content for when it's called for. And finally, reason number three: very exciting action and effects. The action scenes are done well and achieve the level of excitement that they are going for. And the visual effects are top of the line as well. Overall, this is just a great film overall, and it even gave a small harken back to the original 90s film. Great lovable characters, exciting action, skilled writing... just a joy overall. 9/10 for Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","DarkVulcan29","29 December 2017","A delightful follow up to the 1995 film that starred the late great Robin Williams, comes the new film 22 years later, I really like the way it let's the audience know that it is a sequel and not a reboot. It 's joyfully adventure basic a send up of Indiana Jones and Lara Croft films. But the characters really stick together, that is what makes the film fun to watch. Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan , Kevin Hart and Jack Black play there parts very well, has teenagers who get pulled in a video game , and our in the bodies of the characters of the game. Jack Black steals most of the scenes has a teenage girl trapped in the body of a man. Villians here look like cast offs from a Mad Max film, but are still fun to watch. It's not totally a kids film, there are a few adult jokes put in. I really was entertained here, it's not a masterpiece but just a fun time, and sometimes that is all you need. So go in this expecting nothing more or less. I believe video game fans will find this a fun time.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","regula1","8 December 2017","The original Jumanji was supposed to be a one-and-done film, even though it teased the potential for a sequel. Many voiced trepidation at the prospect of a sequel after all these years later, and after the tragic death of original star Robin Williams, there were valid concerns about whether this sequel could be both a good movie and a fitting sequel and tribute to what had come before.I am glad to report that it fulfilled all expectations.The film relies almost entirely on its star power, and it has that in spades with the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. Where the charm resides, though, is the actors playing against their types through the means of real-world to video game body switching: The Rock embodying a nerdy hypochondriac, Hart an all-star jock, Gillan a shy insecure reject, and perhaps most brilliant of them all, Black housing a she's-all-that pretty girl. Together our four teenage protagonists get sucked into the video game incarnation of Jumanji, a jungle land that is threatened from the typical video game threat, and our heroes must do the usual video game tasks in order to beat the game and return to the real world, all without getting killed in-game, which will get them killed in real life after three lives.The film thematically treads the same sort of ground that other teen movies tend to cover, mainly the stereotypical high school tropes get thrust into a situation that forces them to work together to correct each other's flaws and by the end they return to their 'normal' lives as better people.What the film does different in the body-switching is that these tropes are transferred onto adult actors, people who each have tropes of their own, and the way that each actor gets to play against their type is definitely what makes this movie so fun.On the flipside, like a video game, the villain is very one- dimensional, and while the narrative isn't necessarily harmed by it, it does stand out as something that's lacking, wishing that the villain was more than just 'I will kill you because reasons'.Also, the character introductions in the real world at the beginning of the film feel very forced, as in we all know they end up in the game, and the reasons they get into the situation feel very convenient, as if the writers could not find an elegant means to get these four people in the same place in front of the game console at the same time, so they just threw them all together.These are fairly minor nitpicks, as the pace of this film is fast, it doesn't really drag at all, and while they do repeat a joke or two, it doesn't step over the line into annoying. All this makes for a very fun film, definitely worth your time this holiday season, and after once it gets released on home media.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","ThomasDrufke","23 December 2017","Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is easily the best video game movie ever made. Everyone who follows movies even remotely knows that's not a hard task to complete, but Jumanji earnestly gets that title from me by being self-aware, armed with charismatic performances, and an undeniably fun and energetic tone from beginning to end.The second pairing from Kevin hart and Dwayne Johnson comes as way of a sequel to the classic 1995 film, Jumani. Instead of just rebooting a beloved film 20 years later, this installment does feel like a standalone film, but in more than one way, it honors the legacy that began with the Robin Williams led film in the 90's. What better way to do that than get The Rock and Hart to team-up again for an adventurous action-comedy. Their chemistry, along with Karen Gillan and Jack Black are quite the team. Luckily, the film doesn't rely too heavily on Hart and Johnson's funny banter from Central Intelligence last year. Each character had their own arc and I didn't feel as though any one particular character was put in the background.Did I approve of all the character choices and humor? Certainly not. Jack Black is a naturally funny guy, but I wasn't too fond of his portrayal of a popular teenage girl. All of the characters are stereotypes obviously, but for some reason that character rubbed me the wrong way. Gillan on the other-hand, was much more in her comfort zone than it seemed like she was in the Guardians films. Her range of playing a scared and vulnerable young woman to be a ""dance fighting"" bada** was a joy to watch, and playing off of Johnson may have even superseded Johnson and Hart for me.Like everyone else, I was very skeptical of this film for the last few years. What was the need to go back and try to recapture the spirit of the first film? Well, they reinvented the wheel without replacing the entire car. Using video games instead of a board game seemed like a cheap trick, but it ended up being the best decision the franchise could have made. Where do you go from here? Well, it now seems the possibilities are endless. In all, a well-rounded cast, endless energy, and a little heart go a long way with this one.8.6/10","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","rockman182","22 December 2017","The original Jumanji is a nostalgic film from my childhood. It still held up when I rewatched it earlier this month. The effects aren't the greatest but the film was fun and had a lot of heart. I was not one of those annoying people who had pitchforks out when they heard about Jumanji being rebooted or getting a sequel. Always give a film a chance, that's what I do. After seeing promo pics and trailers I was hyped. I like The Rock and Kevin Hart working together, and also love Karen Gillan. The film looked like a fresh spin on the original and even looked like an effort that wanted to stand on its own. It does exactly that. Say what you want, this is a very fun film.Four different teenagers are given detention and once there they discover an old video game named Jumanji. They plug the game system in and are sucked into the world of Jumanji, primarily in a jungle where they must return a jewel into an enormous Jaguar statue. Sounds easy, but the jungle is filled with tricks and traps and wild animals. Oh yeah, the four characters become the characters in the game physically. This makes for a very entertaining time with almost non stop humor on top of its adventure.The actors do very well in this. Jack Black and Kevin Hart bring the comedy. Jack Black's character is actually the embodiment of a self absorbed teenage girl, and he plays that remarkably well. I dig Kevin Hart with his loud commentary. I also love that he's always getting knocked over thrown around, in the way of danger, or in this films case- explodes. All the humor in this film comes at you tenfold and it all works. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat and, while somewhat predictable its never boring. The action scenes are gripping and grand scale. I loved the world of the film and the connection between the characters.The film has a few nods to the original but the film is still quite independent from the original which is nice. Really its in name alone; the connection to the first. Overall, its a blast at the end of the year. Its a re-watchable and exciting comedy/adventure. Take off your critical lenses and actually sit and enjoy this. The negative things I'm reading about this are analyzing it on such a deep level. Dude, relax and enjoy.8/10","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","pal05052003","19 December 2017","Jumanji 2 is a hilarious, fun, escapist, adventure movie starring The Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. Using video game rules, the movie truly brings video game magic to the screen, and subtly pokes fun at the action genre. The Rock is great as usual and has a literally huge presence in the movie. The chemistry among the cast is great, and the Rock proves once again he is the go to guy if Hollywood wants to revitalize a franchise, though he has yet to prove he can fuel an actual franchise by himself. As for Jack Black and Kevin Hart, both provide great comedy to an already comical The Rock. However, Kevin Hart's character is more interesting than Black's and therefore wins the crown for best comical character in the movie. Karen Gillan is stunning, and kicks ass, though she is not given much else to do. The movie has great sweeping shots, and over the top action, but all of this makes the movie plausible, given the premise that the characters are trapped in a game world. Recommended for all to watch","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","alexanderliljefors","27 December 2023","One of the best adventure films since Indiana Jones!Honestly this is a great and genuinely funny film that really manages to capture that feeling of a jungle and exploring a mysterious world.The acting is great and it actually is one of those rare films that feels authentic and real.Its a really great concept that frels very intriguing and thrilling to watch.If you havent watch this i recommend to watch The original Jumanji from 1995 before watching this. I also really recommend watching ""Jumani: The next Level"" from 2019.Genuinely a great franchise of modern film that you need to watch!","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","peterp-450-298716","3 April 2018","""I think we got, like, sucked into the game.
And we've become the avatars that we chose.""I was sure about one thing. A remake of ""Jumanji"" is the same as repainting the Mona Lisa and exhibiting this copy. Ridiculous, inglorious and unnecessary. I was afraid this movie would be ridiculed and laughed with. And on top of that, they've asked Dwayne Johnson to join. Not exactly an actor you'll see in what they call the ""better"" films. I thought it would be something like ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" and that I would curse the makers afterwards, because they dared to copy a milestone with the late Robin Williams starring in it. For once, however, I have to admit that I was wrong. It's been a long time since I've amused myself so much while watching a movie.In the original movie, it was of course Robin Williams who took care of the humorous part. And also the inhabitants of the jungle (with some bad looking computer graphics) who stirred things up in town, were kind of fun. In this movie nobody really stands out. They are all hilarious. And this because of the fact that the four main characters (who are being sucked into the game) are totally the opposite of the in-game character they've chosen.During a detention these four totally different students discover this dust-covered Jumanji game. This well-known game has been tranformed into an oldskool console game (well, they had to keep up with the times). Spencer (Alex Wolff) is a spindly little boy, plagued by all kinds of allergies, who looks rather clumsy and timid. Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) is an immense athlete. Bethany (Madison Iseman) is such a typical blond teengirl who thinks she's the centre of the universe instead of the sun. Martha (Morgan Turner) is the shy type. Again the same stereotypes you'll see in a film about an American high-school.It becomes really funny after they have been transformed into the characters from the computer game. Maybe too predictable but still hilarious at times. The schmuck suddenly sees how his biceps have grown. The stuck-up, smartphone-addicted instagram bimbo notices to her horror that her perfectly streamlined teenage body is trapped in a chubby, male body. The timid girl is suddenly a duplicate of Lara Croft and to her surprise she has knowledge of certain combat techniques. The well-built sports fanatic gets a rather submissive role as a dwarfish male with a backpack.Now get ready for the big surprise. The most hilarious role is played by Dwayne Johnson. That was really the last thing I expected. And of course Jack Black provides some humorous moments. Although the male genitalia are the main subject here. And the part where Karen Gillian has to learn the art of seduction, I actually was laughing my head off. And finally, a small remark. The pilot in the game (who's the long-lost teenager) looks a lot like footballstar Eden Hazard!But not only the interplay and the witty interactions convinced me. I also thought that the cleverly put together concept of a video game, was a brilliant idea. The NPC's that showed up here and there, the cut scenes and the way the participants return to the game (after which the tattoo on their arm suddenly changes) are all elements you can experience in a game. In other words, this film scores extremely high in terms of originality. On the one hand, the film ""Jumanji : Welcome to the jungle"" is an extension of the original film. But on the other hand it's also a stand-alone film (with only one reference to the original flick). So I have to admit that I am pleasantly surprised by this film. And even with Dwayne Johnson in the lead. There are no more certainties in this life !","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","justin-fencsak","8 March 2018","When Jumanji leapt from book to screen in 1995, it became a hit loved by kids and their families like me who saw it at the Loews in Wayne. Robin Williams, fresh off hits like Aladdin and Mrs Doubtfire, delivered a performance for the ages. An animated tv series soon followed. Then Robin Williams passed away. Soon, it was time to reboot Jumanji for a new generation hooked on 3d games. Thus, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was born. The character that Williams played, Alan Parrish, is honored in an homage during the beginning of the movie. The main cast is excellent, with Karen Gillan, hot off Doctor Who and Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as Kevin Hart and Jack Black along with Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. The Rock, in his biggest hit of his career since the last Fast and Furious movie. The special effects are just as good as the original movie, and there's tons of pop culture and video game references in this film that is still playing in theaters while making its digital HD debut this week with a physical release in two weeks. You don't have to watch the original Jumanji in order to appreciate this film. Game on!!!","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","lunalovitt","8 April 2018","When I first heard they were making a reboot of Jumanji, I was skeptical. These days it seems like everything is getting a half-assed reboot or spinoff so when I went in to watch this movie I didn't expect anything life changing or original. And I was shocked with the results. This story was actually GOOD. It took the original concept that was Jumanji and made its own twists and turns and didn't actually butcher the original source. And I really enjoyed all the characters as well, which is something I couldn't exactly say about the original film. I was so surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie that honestly I find myself wanting to go back and re-watch it. When it comes to movies starring comedians, I don't really get very hopeful about the content and quality of the movie, especially these days when ""comedians"" turn out to mostly rely upon profanities and slap stick more than wit and actual humor. However, the jokes in this movie were on point and I really enjoyed Kevin Hart's performance as well as Dwayne Johnson's. They played well off one another and it wasn't over the top. And wow... I really did think Jack Black had hit the high point of his career back in Kung Fu Panda and was on the down slope, but he was easily one of the best parts of this movie. The casting for this movie was great overall.
 
Not only that, but this movie was more than the typical ""comedy"" movies you see nowadays that are all about getting drunk/spitting out as many curse words in a sentence as possible/being ""shocking"". There was a serious plot behind it with actual stakes and it played its serious moments very well. All of the characters went through important evolutions that were believable by the end of the film. Now, it wasn't perfect. There are things that were a bit off in terms of continuity and if you know the first Jumanji then you might see where I'm getting at, but it wasn't enough to take away from the film itself. Overall this was a very enjoyable movie and I'd definitely watch it again. The movie was a tasteful update to the Jumanji franchise, and to be honest I'd love to see if they have plans for a sequel. I'd certainly watch it given how well they treated this movie.Then again, I did watch Pitch Perfect 3 in the same night as this one, so this positive review might be a little biased when taking in both movies side by side in a short period of time.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","subxerogravity","22 December 2017","I've seen the original movie once or twice as a kid but don't recall it well enough to do a comparison.I do love the update of Junmanji adapting itself to a video game over a board game (but I do know lots of kids who still play board games). This was the second time Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart teamed up in a movie together. The first being Central Intelligence, though you can't go wrong with a little Hart and one big Johnson, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a better fit for them than Central Intelligence, even without Hart and Johnson's help from some star power like Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas.So just like with the original film, a few kids find some old game and begin to play it, only to get sucked into the game they are playing. Keeping with the video game tone the kids become the avatars they select. So this kid name Spencer, who in real life is a little nerd, gets to become The Rock, who plays Dr. Smolder Bravestone, not much of a doctor of anything but he's got strength, speed, and no weaknesses, so like I said, he becomes the Rock, and what kid does not want to become the Rock, right? (hell I'm a grown man and I want to become The Rock)Not all the other kids are as lucky with the avatars they randomly selected. 6 feet tall high school football star, becomes 5'3"" Kevin Hart, who plays Moose Finbar, and acts as Bravestone's weapons holder. Not that being Kevin Hart, who is funny and rich would not be cool, but not really something I've dreamed about, but it could be worse, you could be Bethany, a cute and shallow teenage girl who picks the avatar Shelly Oberon, who happens to be a fat middle age man. Some of the best laughs of the movie do come from Black playing a girl discovering the advantages and disadvantages of being a dude.Then we have Karen Gillan, as the avatar Ruby Roundhouse, a total jab at the female stereotypes in video games, a hot chick who can kick butt, but is not wearing enough clothing, which makes the user Martha uncomfortable.The movie is all about what it would be like to truly live out the game as the characters treat each adventure like a level in the video game and have to overcome these adventures without loosing the three lives they are given.It does not make for much character development. Each person comes into the game with with certain issues that seem to be what the film was going to focus on, but the whole thing went by too fast to be of any substance.This new Jumanji works on the pure star power it has as we watch The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black interact with each other as they play the game. It's worth it for that and that alone","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","bob-the-movie-man","21 December 2017","In 1995, Joe Johnston (""The Rocketeer"", ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") directed ""Jumanji"" - a quirky, fantastical and dark film starring the late, great Robin Williams that got a rough critical reception at the time of release, but was embraced by the public and has gone on to be a modern classic. So when it was announced that a sequel was in the works 22 years later, my first reaction was ""Oh no... is nothing sacred?"". It's fair to say that I went into this flick with extremely low expectations.But I have to say that - given this low base - I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually quite a fun fantasy film that I predict that older kids will adore. Initially set (neatly) in 1995, a teen - Alex (Nick Jonas, of the Jonas Brothers) unearths the board game Jumanji where it ended up buried in beach-sand at the end of the last film. ""Who plays board games any more?"" he scoffs, which the game hears and morphs into a game cartridge. Cheesy? Yes, but no more crazy than the goings on of the first film. Back in 2017, four high-school teens - geeky Spencer (Alex Wolff, ""Patriot's Day""); sports-jock Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain); self-obsessed beauty Bethany (Madison Iseman); and self-conscious, nerdy and shy Martha (Morgan Turner) - find the game and are sucked into it, having to complete all the game levels before they can escape.But they are not themselves in the game; they adopt the Avatars they chose to play: Dr Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson, ""San Andreas""); Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart, ""Get Hard""); Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan, ""Dr Who"", ""The Circle""; ""Guardians of the Galaxy""); and Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black, ""Sex Tape"", ""Kong""). Can they combine their respective game talents - and suppress the human mental baggage they brought with them - to escape the game?There was a really dark time-travelling angle to the storyline of the original film - the traumatic start of Disney's ""Flight of the Navigator"" was perhaps also borrowed from the concept in the book by Chris Van Allsburg - and an attempt is made to recreate this in the sequel. The first film rather pulled its punches though in favour of a rather Hollywood ending: will this be the case this time? The film delivers laughs, but in a rather inconsistent fashion - it is mostly smile-worthy rather than laugh-out-loud funny. Much fun is had with the sex change of Bethany's character, with Jack Black's member featuring - erm - prominently. The characters all have strengths and weaknesses, like a game of Top Trumps, and this also entertains. But the most humour derives from the ""three lives and it's game over"" device giving the opportunity for various grisly ends, often relating to the above referenced weaknesses. Given the cast that's been signed up, the acting is not exactly first rate although Karen Gillan shines as the brightest star. But ""it's not bloody Shakespeare"" so ham-acting is not that much of a problem and the cast all have fun with their roles. Dwayne Johnson in particular gets to play out of character as the 'nerd within the hunk', and his ""smouldering look"" skill - arched eyebrow and all - is hilarious. Rhys Darby, looking so much like Hugh Jackman that I had to do several double takes, also turns up as an English game-guide in a Land Rover, and Bobby Cannavale (""Ant Man"") is Van Pelt, the villain of the piece.There has been much controversy over Karen Gillan's child-sized outfit. But she is clearly a parallel to the well-endowed Lara Croft, and young male teens didn't play that game for the jungle scenery! She is meant to be a hot and sexy video game character, and man - does she deliver! Gillan is not just hot in the film: she is #lavahot. This makes her comic attempts at flirting lessons (as the internally conflicted Martha) especially funny. Hats off to her stunt doubles as well, for some awe-inspiring martial arts fight scenes.Fans of ""Lost"" will again delight in the Jumanji scenery, surely one of the most over-used film locations in Hawaii if not the world!Where the film gets bogged down is in too much cod-faced philosophizing over the teenager's ""journeys"". This is laid on in such a clunky manner in the early (slow!) scenes that the script could have been significantly tightened up. And as I said above, the script - written, rather obviously, by a raft of writers - could have been so much funnier. Most of the humour comes from visually seeing what's happening: not from the dialogue.Directed by Jake Kasdan (son of director and Star Wars/Raiders screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan) it's really not half as bad as it could have been or as I feared, and I would gladly watch it again. For it's target audience, which is probably kids aged 10 to 14, I think they will love it. And, unlike many holiday films, the parents won't be totally bored either (especially the Dads, for the obvious misogynistic reasons outlined above!).","8/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","tk-to-dj","10 December 2017","Jumanji 1995 has many memorial moments for example: The reveal of the Jumanji board, monkeys robbing a police car, the stampede, sinking floors, the flooded room with some crocodiles, the incredible use of the sound track, basically a lot of stuff. The original is well crafted and now it's 2017 and we have Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It's a fun, action comedy film with really cool references to the first film but as much as it entertains me it's not Jumanji. As Robin Williams said ""I've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares"" but in this film the jungle is safe enough to make margaritas and have scented candles on display. Dwayne Johnson tries to play a geeky character but he still plays that big tough guy. Kevin Hart plays himself nothing new, Karen Gillan plays a geeky shy girl and she has done that before and finally the highlight of the film is Jack Black playing as a teenage girl named Bethany. Everything Jack says is incredibly funny and will leave you falling off your seat. Like I said before it's not Jumanji, 6.5/10.","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","kosmasp","11 April 2018","I guess you could do worse than hire The Rock to help make a decent remake. So if you are a big fan of the Jumanji with Robin Williams in it, this may feel weird at first for you, but if you can get over it, you will have quite a decent movie to enjoy watching.The effects are good, the characters are fun and while it might be a bit too weird and off at times, this still is entertaining enough to hold its own. It's a nice ensemble of actors and they all have something to add to the story. Some cliches will be served, but you always have that. It still has some nice touches for fans of games, which is a nice treat.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Irishchatter","26 December 2019","So my family and I decided to watch this on Netflix tonight, I am glad to say I wasn't disappointed in this sequel because when most sequel movies pop up after so many goddamn years, they tend to be absolutely rubbish!Seeing Jack Black unleash his feminine side without hesitation was the absolute spark. Also it was actually surprising that Kevin Hart was funny in this, for real I would tend to skip his stand up shows since they are unfunny so yeah.I'm not gonna waffle more no sense remarks on this movie, just watch it, you'll definitely like the amount of action that went into it!!!","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","scott-82443","22 December 2017","Fun movie for family. Silly at times with decent action and interesting people. If you are a guy wanting to bring wife/girlfriend to movie you'll both walk out feeling you got your money's worth then this is a great pick. It won't win any fancy awards but best movie in theaters right now.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","msbreviews","8 April 2018","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This is one of the best surprises of 2017, simply because no one expected this film to be this funny and entertaining! While the original movie has its moments, it loses itself in its silliness and nonsense. Jake Kasdan's installment proves to be a well-directed remake/reboot/sequel/whatever with a hilarious screenplay and a fast pacing (plus a cool score).Nevertheless, without this cast, it wouldn't be as good as it is. The fact that everyone (except Kevin Hart) portrays an anti-type character is itself remarkable. Watching a beast like Dwayne Johnson play an easily scared kid or Jack Black acting like he is a young teenage girl trapped in a middle-aged man's body is something that I never thought I needed until I actually witnessed it. Karen Gillan also does a fantastic job and Bobby Cannavale, unfortunately, is just portraying a villain who shows up once in a while, for a few seconds.Still, the film has its narrative flaws and two of them are arguably plot holes. The CGI sometimes is too noticeable and it bothered me a little. Basically, if you are able to accept or ignore the story's lack of logic on some details, you are in for a hell of a ride. It's entertaining from beginning to end and it even has some unexpected emotional moments, so if you need to watch an adventurous comedy with some friends at home, watch Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. You are not going to be disappointed!","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","masonsaul","12 December 2019","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a surprisingly incredibly fun sequel/reboot. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas are all incredible and the film is consistently funny throughout and hilarious at certain parts. It's well paced and the direction by Jake Kasdan is great, resulting in lots of enjoyable action sequences. The music by Henry Jackman is really good. It's only brought down slightly by Bobby Cannavale being wasted in a one note performance as the villain.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","joshbarton15","9 December 2017","Jumanji is a film I grew up with so it'll always hold a place in my heart. It's by no means the greatest film ever made but it is a film I never thought would need a sequel, the very idea being a product of the lazy Hollywood cycle. To do a sequel to Jumanji, you have to be brave enough to evolve the franchise and not just rehash it all, which is exactly what they did with Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.When four teenagers get sucked into the video game Jumanji, they become their chosen avatars; Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black), Franklin Finbar (Kevin Hart) and Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan). Together they must play along and finish the game to stand any chance of getting back home.The evolution of Jumanji from board game to video game is one of the sensible ways that the creative team bring us a sequel two decades after the original was released. It's the only way the kids of today would ever play it so to see the game itself change to attract new players makes sense. The idea of a sequel after all this time is one that left me skeptical however, thanks to a changed concept of the story taking place inside the game rather than the game coming to the real world, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle quickly became a sequel to become interested in.The changed concept is one that leads to a good old-fashioned adventure romp full of action and plenty of fun for the entire family. The idea of the kids being sucked into the game and being forced to play it out as characters totally opposite to their everyday selves makes for an amusing watch, the raucous laughter from the audience being a telling sign.No one is having more fun here than the four leads of the film mind. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan all make Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle such great entertainment; Johnson milking it while playing a nerd trapped inside the body fit for an action movie star, Hart revelling in the big guy trapped in a small guy's body role, Black stealing the film as the Instagram obsessed girl playing as an overweight professor, a role he seems so suited for, and Gillan bringing the fierceness when she needs to as Ruby Roundhouse a.k.a. the ""Killer of Men"" which, as you've guessed, is so far away from her character back in the real world. You get a sense that working on this set would have been so much fun.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle works as a continuation of the Jumanji franchise, even if there are people out there who are adamant it won't. It's the perfect kind of film to take the family along to and I can guarantee fun will be had all round. It was much better than I was expecting and I'm ready to call it the biggest surprise of the year.","1/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","MovieCriticOnline","5 March 2018","It is so cliche and formulated. Every note is so carefully (overly) crafted. You say this and then you say that. Everything feels wooden, inauthentic. The original wasn't great, but fun entertainment and stuck to the book. Each character is a millennia caricature with ""cutesy"" moments they spent months writing. I didn't see one spontaneous moment in the entire film. They took the cast of Breakfast Club and stuck it in Jumanji. And they made sure they got every racial representative in there, not because the original books had it, but because they wanted to get social justice.I feel as annoyed by forced social justice racial diversity, as I would if they remade the Cosby show with Asian, White and Hispanic actors.The acting is just so bad. The mediocrity that people seem to enjoy today is astounding. The movie made ZERO sense, so they made sure they explained it, laying it out in lazy expositions.When you have to explain everything, your writing is poorly done. Show -- don't tell. The CGI was horrible.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","jon.h.ochiai","24 December 2017","I really enjoyed ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"". ""Jumanji"" is way more than its movie trailer. Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan are awesome. The Rock embodies a genuine ""nerd' charm in his action hero persona. It's nice to 'see' Karen not hidden behind the Nebula visage of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". I'm a fan from her short lived series ""Selfie"". Gillan is beautiful, beguiling, and comedic charm. Jack Black as Shelly the gender swapped avatar practically steals the show illustrating the movie's surprising message. Game avatar Shelly, who's real life persona is ""it"" girl Bethany, schools now stunning Martha (Gillan) how be attractive to men. Shelly says, ""You're hot. Now own it."" Black offers comic relief in the video game mayhem as Shelly confesses to Smolder Bravestone (Johnson) and diminutive Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart) that having penis makes it so easy to pee. In the touching narrative arc, as their avatars in ""Jumanji"" Martha tells Bethany that she is so self-absorbed, consequently totally so selfish. Bethany tells Martha that she judges people first, before they have chance to hurt her. Director Jake Kasdan surprises not so much with the light hearted large-scale action with Johnson and Gillan kicking some ass battling motorcycle villains commanded by Bravestone's arch nemesis Van Pelt, played by ruthless vile Bobby Cannavale. Rather his poignant message in this video gamer movie is: Be who you are. This is amazing given that the screenplay based on the book, ""Jumanji"" has screenwriters Chis McKenna, Erik Sommer, Scott Rosenberg, and Jeff Pinker. Usually having that many writers inevitably generates kluge. Instead they are often touching. Young Spencer now The Rock's Bravestone has been in love with teen iconoclast Martha, now Ruby Roundhouse, since 7th grade. Both Johnson and Gillan are the most beautiful screen actors in paradox as Spencer says, ""I'm a nerd."" Martha says, ""I like nerds."" Bravestone fears death realizing that he only has one game ""life"" remaining in ""Jumanji"", doubting if he can save his friends and return the magical green jewel to the Jaguar statue. His friend Finbar, played by Hart, reminds that in the real world, ""We all only have one life."" So do your best. That's what anyone can do. Johnson is amazing movie star swag and gentle introspection as Bravestone. Hart is nervous comic energy as Finbar. He tells someone about his avatar's weakness, ""Cake makes me explode."" Don't often hear that one. Hart is also all heart. Their partnership along with Gillan and Black are about seeing others as greater than they know. In the end that's what makes you become. And perhaps, the hero arises from within. ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is derivative of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"". 
""Jumanji"" does not aim to be as iconic, although it is about: Who you are? Who are you going to be? Young Spencer, Fridge, Bethany, and Martha, played convincingly by Alex Wolf, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman, and Morgan Turner, all enter the video game ""Jumanji"" as who they are. Perhaps, they transform as greater. Really that's up to them. Director Kasdan invites you along for the ride with cool martial arts and gorgeous locales. Go along for the ride. The ride is well worth it.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","bettycjung","1 January 2018","1/1/18. Ok, i'm going to say that this was pure fun and extremely enjoyable to watch! I can't say that for too many movies these days, but this one will have staying power until everyone looking for a fun movie have had a chance to see it! Johnson, Black and Hart were all in fine form, at their best, and Gillan was a pure surprise. I am sure we will see more of her in the future. This is truly one of the FEW remakes I can recommend to see. It's not exactly a remake-remake, but a theme in variation. I have not heard so much giggling in a theater audience in a long time, it kept ALL viewers young and old engaged. When was the last time you can say that of any movie? Go see it!","3/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","thebricks","9 December 2017","Saw this at a sneak preview courtesy of Amazon, this was a great film. Everyone in the audience loved it. It's honestly more of a movie about 90's videogames, and if you played them a lot like I did, you'll love this film. Karen Gillan was the only weak spot of the entire film, but I assume she didn't have many lines because of her Scottish accent, but she is a great actress who was criminally underused. The one Jonas brother did a great job as the Seaplane pilot, I was pleasantly surprised.Highly recommend this film, it's definitely great holiday fare.","5/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Leofwine_draca","19 November 2019","A lot of the goodwill surrounding this reboot/long-time-coming sequel is thanks to The Rock, who gives an exemplary - and very funny - performance as a nerdish teenager trapped in a hulking action man's body. The rest is merely so-so by Hollywood standards, but at least it's inoffensive and fast-paced, so there's little to dislike. Just not too much to love either.Compared to the original JUMANJI, this one has been updated a little to the video game era, and I did like the old nod to Atari. The plotting is one of the worst things about this, with a generic, barely-glimpsed villain and random action scenes utilising barely-impressive CGI animal effects. Of the cast, Kevin Hart is quite funny, but I found Jack Black bland and Karen Gillan to be completely out of her depth; the obvious doubling in every one of her fight scenes also gets to be a little much.","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","kuuk3","8 December 2017","Saw via an early Unlimited Screening. Its no Oscar contender, but for a comedy adventure family film; it fulfils its purpose. None of the heroes use guns, although they do snap necks. They also show several deaths with blood splatter. So not for the squeamish. There are also scenes of bugs entering ears which can be off-putting.The teenage high school drama and love story is cheesy, as is the school bully / loner story arc. Its nothing we have not seen before. But it sets up the character traits and once were in the Jungle, it gets a lot better. It feels a little short, and some scenes like the Transporter Hanger was suppose to hard, but the lack of bad guys didn't make much sense. Every scene appeared to have been written to serve each characters death in turn. From eating cake to walking alongside a cliff. Trying to keep track of who had how many lives left let you predict who was going to die next. But it was at least trying to show character growth with each plot point and establish how these people change which is something I suppose. Removing the staples from magazines before recycling was nonsense. But that's the level of thought that had gone into the writing process. But again, its not trying to win any Oscars and is up against Star Wars in the cinema (whose stupid idea was that?) so I doubt its going to beat it at the box office. But once were in the game, its a fun, adventure film with four strong comedic actors doing what they do best. It excelled at its goal and is worth watching on the big screen.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","TheMovieDiorama","24 February 2018","If someone said to me ""Luke, there's a Jumanji sequel coming out..."" I would've laughed and shouted ""Objection!"". Yet, here we are and guess what? It doesn't suck! The same concept as the original but substituting the board game with a retro video game from 1996. Four students are magically transported into the game where they must place a jewel at the head of a jaguar mountain in order to save Jumanji. Fortunately the creators didn't rehash the exact same idea, instead they implemented a modern twist to it. That is the sequel's strength, deconstructing how video games function. Back in my youth when I aspired to be a video game developer, I self-taught all the elements into making a game. NPCs, avatars, levels, respawning etc. so their inclusion in this felt like a little nod to me which brought a gleeful smile to my face. This re-imagination focussed on comedy and action, the fantasy traits from the original have been put to one side. Whilst the comedy is hit and miss (mostly miss) and the action is plagued with CGI...I was still entertained. Jack Black was the standout as he portrays a girl in a middle aged man's body, had me laugh quite a few times. Dwayne Johnson was likeable as ever, but then again so were everyone else. The differing character archetypes and the ""you can be whoever you want to be"" moral felt extremely forced and all too familiar. Include the plot linearity, pointless antagonist and lack of pop songs (honestly, would've been more appropriate than an original musical score) and you have yourself a good film. Not great, but highly watchable. Maybe that is just what audiences needed, to which I cannot complain. A pleasant surprise is how I would describe this. Was just waiting for Guns N' Roses to play...waited patiently...the film was ending in its incredibly cringeworthy eye rolling way...and...YES! Credits song! Luke was happy.","3/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Tigerbai1","5 April 2018","Jack Black steals the show and Karen Gillan as Martha WOW talk about easy on the eyes -- I thought she was pretty as Amy Pond in Doctor Who - I believe she's getting more beautiful. I didn't even know she was in the movie. I don't think you can really compare it to the original because they are so different -- the first one was more dark & not as much comedy, but I love them both. If you have not seen the original go back and watch it. Enjoy.","5/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","phubbs","6 April 2018","Welcome to the jungle...really? Is that the best they could come up with? How many movies have used that in one way or another now?So at the end of the first movie (in 1969) the board game Jumanji was thrown into a river by Alan Parrish; 26 years later (1995) its somehow ended up in France apparently. Fast forward to 1996 and the board game has once again been discovered...but back in America? (I trust that wasn't supposed to be the same beach from the first movie). Anyway the game has somehow evolved with the times and is now a videogame console; and once again it lures another unsuspecting youth into its jungle themed clutches. Fast forward again to 2016 and four students will also discover the board game which will trigger the same things that happened before. And round and round we go.So I gotta admit that I liked the idea that this mysterious game can somehow evolve with the times. Back in the first movie (1969) it was a board game to blend in with the era. Now its a videogame console which of course is perfect for this era. The whole idea of the protagonists choosing a game avatar to play as which then turns out to be their live action avatar once inside the game is pretty cool (although 'Red Dwarf' did it first). This does inevitably lead to very stereotypical characters which is deliberate...but doesn't excuse the stereotypical teenage protagonists which wasn't deliberate I'm guessing.Yeah so the teenagers, they're a straight 'Breakfast Club' type bunch for sure. You've got the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the weirdo. So yeah its a complete rip-off. I really felt like they could of done better with these characters despite the movie being full of deliberate cliches and stereotypes. As for the avatars they are also rather cliche, naturally. The Rock is of course just playing the same character he always does, basically himself. Jack Black is the squat, spectacled, old fashioned looking professor type. Kevin Hart is the goofy sidekick type. And Karen Gillian is Lara Croft essentially.One thing that did get me thinking was the in-game characters, the baddies and the in-game guide. The in-game guide and various baddie henchmen all seemed to act like actual videogame characters on rails. In other words they don't interact with the protagonists on a personal level, they just do and say what they were programmed. But some henchmen and the main villain (Bobby Cannavale as Professor Van Pelt, same name as the big game hunter from the first movie) seemed to not do this. It did seem like Van Pelt behaved differently and not in a programmed way like the others, almost as if he were a real person. Now in the original movie we never saw the jungle in the game, obviously this time we do. Alas its not really been visualised that well in my opinion. I always had the impression the jungle was set in an old fashioned British colonial type era mixed with a bit of 'Tarzan' type fantasy. Like the exterior of the board game indicates. Of course as the game evolved so did the interior jungle it seems. This unfortunately has led to all sorts of modern crap turning up like military choppers, motorbikes, modern guns and weapons, ridiculous chase sequences, and lots of explosions. Now I'm sure some people will have liked these elements but for me it totally ruined the entire feel of the movie, or at least the look and feel I was hoping for.Gone is the possibility of quaintness and charm, enter vast CGI chase sequences on-board a military chopper (being chased by man eating CGI rhinos. Why didn't they just shoot them?). Stupid chase sequences with hordes of motorbike riding bad guys. Lots of gunfire, explosions and of course the obligatory martial arts sequences from Ruby Roundhouse. I might add that Ruby Roundhouse spends lots of time trying to learn how to flirt and act sexy to distract some bad guys, but ends up just kicking the crap out of them. Her entire character is utterly pointless, why did we need all that shit when she can just beat them up. Its like one sequence where The Rock's character says he knows CPR but doesn't actually do it when its required. He just stands there and gives instructions to another character, eh??Its really such a shame that this movie went down the route it did. Obviously there was gonna be CGI involved, obviously there was gonna be greenscreen involved, but Jesus Christ could they not do any better than this?! Most of the CGI is bad, real bad. Most of the greenscreen is obvious, real obvious. In fact it gets noticeably worse towards the end in my opinion. There are barely any practical effects which the first movie did incorporate in places. This movie is just ugly from top to bottom and its not helped by all the ludicrous action sequences. Its like half the movie wants to be like 'The Phantom', and the other half like 'Rambo'. Its such a clash of genres and tone.There is also a large plot hole in the way this story works, I think, unless I missed something. In the original Alan Parrish goes back to the point where he started playing the game in 1969 and changes time. This is obviously meant that Judith and Peter would never have played (in 1995) and wouldn't know anything about the game or Alan (having never met him). In this new movie the protagonists meet up with the kid (Alex) who got trapped in the game from 1996. When they all leave Alex goes back to the point he started playing in 1996 and changes time. So if he changed time, how come the four main protagonists still remember everything when they get back to their present day of 2016? Surely there's a chance they would never have ended up playing the game, or the game wouldn't have ended up in the school (?).Anyway once again I find myself completely mystified by a modern movies success. How on earth did this pile of crap make so much money? How on earth did people find this enjoyable?? I could maybe understand it if this was an original movie and the first had never existed, but it does exist! I simply cannot fathom how anyone can accept this utter garbage after the excellent original movie (complete with a terrific Robin Williams) which came out back in 1995. There are some neat little touches here and there, I like the evolution and mystery of the game, and Jack Black is always a pleasure. But apart from that, this was yet another cookie cutter Dwayne Johnson flick. CGI laden trash of the highest order.3.5/10","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","empire331","2 January 2018","While not as funny and intriguing as the original movie, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle delivers good visuals, a predictable storyline and a good performance by Jack Black.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","MichaelNontonMulu","20 December 2017","Well this movie was exactly what I would hope for in term of comedic situation and provided us a good amount of laugh. In fact what my wife and I noticed was the movie was a lot more comedic than adventurous. This was a bit different from the movie's predecessor, the 1995 version of Jumanji which felt having more adventure. Apart from being a sequel to that movie, this one also served as a tribute to Robin Williams who played the lead character of Alan Parrish. From my personal view, the original movie was something that truly blow my mind with the obviously awesome special effect at that time and also a wonderful experience seeing so many animals came and wreak havoc in the city. While in this movie, the characters were the ones who went inside the game and the animals scenes were not that frequent.The movie seemed to focus on the characters development and chemistry which were fun to see. I actually loved Jack Black's character whom I think was totally spot on. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson seemed to hit it off very easily, most likely because they had played in an action comedy movie earlier Central Intelligence. Meanwhile Karen Gillan was totally different from the other roles that I had seen earlier as she provided few funny moments, with the funniest one relating to 2 bad guards. What I loved the most was the high school students were transformed into totally different adult persons and had to adjust themselves with their transformation. Though this also provided some rather crude jokes which probably not understood by young children. The special effects were definitely a lot better than the 1995 version (especially if you see the old one now). During the almost 2 hours duration of the movie, my wife and I had plenty of laughs and for me personally, I was happy and satisfied watching this one as it provided me with the light pop corn movie where I do not have to overthink and just enjoy it. Btw, there was no end credit scene in the movie which was rather surprising as I thought (and hoped) there would be one.Anyway, if you are looking for a fun, light, comedy adventure movie, then you definitely should see this one. If you have seen the original movie, you might also enjoy this as it had the aura and some scenes that would remind you with that one. It would be best if you have seen the original movie first before seeing this one to really appreciate and understand it better. And please do not expect a heavy logical movie where you need to over analyze it. Just go to the cinema and experience the fun.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id","5/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","ZCDomingos","26 December 2017","I'm going to be honest, at first I really didn't consider watching this, specially because I watched the first one and I feel in love instantly. I mean, these days sequels to a 20 years old movies or reboots aren't that great, and I'm not that stingy with reboots, because I just want to watch a movie and not compare to the original one, I like watching it as a standalone. But with these one, I was so worried, but oh man, I love to be wrong in these situations.
It was brilliant, I was not feeling the modern version of Jumanji, but that was cleared in the beginning and it didn't bothered me that much, actually. The characters were amazing to watch, mostly because I easily related to them if I was in that situation with my friends. 
The plot was good enough, nothing new and unique, but it was well planned and cohesive, and that's one of the most important aspects of a plot. 
The game theme was so well written in this movie, and once again super cohesive and it follows it's rules, which demonstrates excellent writing and not just ""for a moment in particular alteration"". The cast was phenomenal, even though I liked The Roch way more before, it was still pleasant to watch him in a different role, actually more funny and interesting than I want to admit, and the rest of the cast I was already in love, specially Jack Black, who killed this performance alongside Kevin Hart and Karen Gillian (who I never watch before, but I'm already in love).
This is a perfect family adventurous movie, you don't have to watch the first one, but there are easter eggs in this sequel that are so special to those who enjoyed the first one, like me.
Give it a go, I can't promise you'll love it, but to me it's good entertainment","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","MLDinTN","13 July 2018","One thing for sure nick jonas is such a terrible actor, I don't want to see him on screen. Anyways, this movie is about 4 teens that get sucked into a video game. In the game, their characters are complete opposites of their real selves. They must solve the mystery of the island and return this emerald to the top of some peek. Like a game, they have 3 lives and learn to use death to their advantage. Along the way, the meet, Alex, played by nick jonas, whom was a teen that went missing 20 years ago. He has been stuck in the game, not able to advance. There is some crazy CGI I can only assume meant to look video game listic. Like stampeding rhinos, attacking hippos, a den of snakes, driving a bike over impossible terrain. The tone is kept light hearted, trying to be funny at times.FINAL VERDICT: I think this is geared for 12 year olds, just too silly for me to say it's worth watching.","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","alessandrowoodbridge","24 December 2017","I would watch this movie two more times at least. This was a very funny movie. Arguably one of the best performance Jack Black has done. When I watched this with my family, in a packed movie theatre, I kid you not, the entire cinema was laughing during quite a few of the scenes. The humour is excellently tailored to the audience and is a beautiful tribute to the original Jumanji with Robin Williams. The way it fantastically coincides with the original movie and moves onto a sort of sequel to this is beautiful, and a rare thing these days. The movie is very funny and easily one of the greatest movies to have come out this year. It is certainly in the top 15 movies that have come out, post 2010, accompanied with the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool and now the recent movie that just came out, Bright. If you felt that Bright was also under-appreciated by movie critics, the exact same thing has happened here as Jumanji is a 100% gaurantee, a movie that will be appreciated after watching. Personally, I would watch it again and again with people. It is not just a movie to watch and discard, this is one to put on the bookshelf and watch again in the future. Loved it. Thank you for such a great movie with a fantastic and fun cast who clearly have great chemistry on and off the screen.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","hiraishinnojutsu","21 December 2017","Start with a slow pace, this move gave me the same movie experience when I watched Geostorm (2017): it's so boring, that in the middle of it, I just want this movie to just skip to end credits already. even when I saw the trailer, the movie just wasn't too promising, and man, I've never been feeling so wrong when I decided to just give it a go despite the former reason. the first Jumanji movie (1995), though not a masterpiece, was at least likeable to the point that it became almost the entire today's twenty-something's childhood. This movie almost do nothing but insult that beautiful legacy by just existing as a sequel no one even asked before (almost like the female version of Ghostbusters did (2016) to the original Ghostbusters (1984), and thank god I didn't watch the former on the theater, otherwise I just banged my head to the hardest and the thickest wall many times until I felt I had unwatched it). Sure the jokes make everyone laughs (and I hate to admit that I laughed few times too), but not all the jokes are the good jokes worth laughing out loud for. I'm pretty sure some of the viewers decided to use a cringe expression to some of the jokes, especially the ones that included male's vital organ as the laughing material. The action scenes were not good either, I mean, to the overall scenes, it feels like they were sinking very deep in the bottom of the ocean in the middle of a vast sea of talking, jokes, drama, and any other kind of unimportant moments. some of the moments with the cgi (and the plot) makes me think this movie should have been made into a tv series instead of a 2-hour long movie that ends up as a one of the year's worst movie ever set foot on the big screen (though I don't think many people would like it either). so, in short, all I was saying can be put in this one sentence: not even the comedy trio Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson-Kevin Hart-Jack Black can make this movie interesting to watch from beginning to end.","2/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","aubrielynnrose","12 July 2023","When I saw another Jumani coming out I rolled my eyes at another remake. A huge fan of Robin Williams and the first one. However the cast was awesome. The concept was different from the original yet with one scene they tied it into the first movie. They brought it into modern times with their digital twist. Watching the Rock and Kevin Heart and Jack Black play teenage opposites of themselves was hysterical. It was action packed and suspenseful enough to hold the attention of adults but not too much where young kids would be too scared to enjoy. My two young kids, husband and I enjoyed it and had a great family movie night!It's definitely a movie I'd watch again.","6/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","anselmdaniel","18 January 2020","This review contains spoilers.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fantasy adventure comedy movie that premiered in 2017. The movie is directed by Jake Kasdan, produced by Matt Tolmach, and William Teitler. The story is written by Chris McKenna. The movie stars Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. The movie is a successor to 1995's movie Jumanji. Jumanji which was once a board game becomes a video game that traps school students that play it. The students must work past their differences and cooperate in order to beat the game and win freedom.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a pleasant surprise. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has interesting concepts and execution. The movie became interesting to watch simply because of the ideas it has that represent video games on movies. This is not a video game movie but rather a movie that is based on concepts found in video games. There is still a plot that is akin to movies and the movie uses this to good effect by lampooning concepts found in video games. A running gag in the movie is that non-playable characters simply repeat lines. This is used to good effect by the characters being introduced to non-playable characters not replying to what the players throw at them.The plot of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is basic. This movie has four students that become trapped that ultimately has to solve the mystery of why a student went missing years before. There is not a villain in this movie. There are only obstacles that the students must overcome that are present in the video game they become trapped in. The movie serves these concepts of obstacles well as the characters of Spencer Gilpin, Bethany Walker, Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson, and Martha Kaply have to overcome their differences in order to escape the video game. The actors that play these characters' avatars do an admirable job in the roles. They portray the underlying characters well and it leads to hilarious events in the movie.The movie does have some missed opportunities. I felt that the movie's plot was so basic that it could have been expanded for comedic effect. There are many tropes in video games that could have applied to this movie that are relatable by the audience. If some of these events were shown like a fog-of-war effect or a rendering limit, it could have been fun seeing the player characters see this limitation.I would recommend 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'. This is a solid movie and it serves as more of a spiritual successor to 1995's Jumanji movie.Grade: B","8/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","hjalsayegh","23 December 2017","Movies about video games have the worst rep in movie history. Add to that this being a sequel and has Jack Black in it as a teenage girl... yeah I was expecting something intolerable with it.It starts off lame as expected. A bunch of walking stereotypes all get a contrived reason to have detention together where they find the game and start playing. This leads to the first continuity error of the movie, The game turned into a gaming cartilage when the 90's kid ignored it at first. kindda off it's version of keeping up with the times. When the other kids come across it, it's a console.make no mistake the first 15-20 minutes of this drag like hell. once they're in the game however it's a 180. I totally buy that they are avatars of those same teens. the ""game"" is very straight forward and easy to grasp from the get go with the movie being more about the character's development then anything else. They started off paper thin but the movie played it up nicely, the visuals were fun and... I can't believe I'm saying this but Jack Black was actually funny in this!There is a tie in with the original but it's subtle and I liked how the ending was faithful to how the original ended. This was fun movie for the family. it started at ground zero but made you care about the characters and get invested in it as it went on. 8.5 stars and a recommendation from me.","8/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","29 March 2018","In the months leading up to the release of 2017's ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"", pretty much all you could hear was moans and groans from the collective film-going audience. People were upset that the beloved 1995 Robin Williams classic was getting a sequel. Purists were infuriated that the movie was updating the treacherous game for modern times. Online commentators couldn't get over co-star Karen Gillan's laughably skimpy outfit and took pot-shots at the movie over it. This is one of those films that just couldn't catch a break.Yet, something happened. Early reviews weren't just solid- they were absolutely glowing. A slew of sneak-preview screenings garnered extremely positive feedback from audiences. And when the film was finally released, it earned a near-unanimous acclaim. For a film that just couldn't catch a break, ""Welcome to the Jungle"" became a welcome and fantastic example of that old saying ""never judge a book by its cover."" Everyone was so wrapped up in pre-release drama and accusations... we just never considered that it might have not only been good- it might have actually been better than the original.Twenty years after the original adventure, a group of modern-day high school students all find themselves stuck in detention for varying reasons. Neurotic geek Spencer (Alex Wolff), meat-headed football star Anthony (Ser'Darius Blain), awkward loner Martha (Morgan Turner) and self-obsessed popular-girl Bethany (Madison Iseman). While sorting old magazines for recycling, the group discovers a mysterious video-game entitled ""Jumanji"" and boot it up, only to find themselves magically pulled inside of the game. Now occupying the bodies of the characters they chose (Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black), the troubled teenagers must complete the game's objective and solve increasingly difficult ""levels"" in order to escape. Along the way, they find a new ally in Alex (Nick Jonas), a long-lost kid who has been stuck in the game since 1996, all while being tracked by the game's villainous baddie Russell Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), whom has attained control over Jumanji's animal kingdom.The greatest treats of ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" are the playful and creative tone the story takes, and the excellent cast who have a grand time hamming it up for the camera. Co-written by Chris McKenna of ""Community"" fame, the script is an absolute blast and a half that both pays tribute to the original film while also taking the story in interesting new directions. The idea of Jumanji transforming itself into a video-game to attract modern teenagers is actually really clever, and it keeps the sequel fresh and unique while still remaining true to the original. There's also a ton of really fun meta-humor that fans of modern games will absolutely adore. I really got a kick over how the secondary characters can only speak a few specific lines over and over, in a playful nod to how video-game NPC's usually only have a handful of programmed responses. And the uproariously funny fact that Gillan's aforementioned skimpy outfit is a satirical swipe at how games often objectify female characters. (Like I said... never judge a book by its cover...)This is aided quite well by director Jake Kasdan's keen eye for visuals and sharp sense of pacing. The film's action set-pieces are genuinely thrilling, the humor is well-delivered and there's almost never a dull moment to be had. Kasdan has honed his skills throughout the years with some delightful projects, including the woefully underrated ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"", and here, that experience pays off in spades. And I can't wait to see what he does next.But perhaps the films greatest achievement is the absolutely outstanding cast. Particularly Johnson, Hart, Gillan and Black, who get to play against type and seem to relish in this in each and every moment. Everyone knows Johnson is one kick-butt dude... so it's a lot of fun seeing him playing the role of a neurotic teen whose allergic to just about everything. Gillan often plays sexy side-kicks or treacherous characters, which makes for a good contrast when she's playing an uncomfortable weirdo who can't talk to guys and doesn't like to be noticed. Hart's an absolute hoot playing a giant linebacker stuck in a diminutive body. And Jack Black... my god, Jack Black is outstanding as a popular teen girl stuck in a middle-aged man's body. He gets the biggest laughs of the film, and wisely never plays the part too broad. He's just perfect, perfect, perfect.It's a genuine surprise just how much fun this film is. I know as a 90's kid myself, I had my standards set high and thought nothing could come close to the original. And I was very pleasantly shocked when I walked out of the theater and realized that in many ways, ""Welcome to the Jungle"" is better than the original. It's sharp. Exciting. Hilarious. It really is the perfect continuation. Sure I could nit-pick the fact that the villainous Van Pelt is a bit under-developed. And I could argue that a few of the effects don't quite work. But on the whole... yeah. If you loved the original, I can't imagine you wouldn't love this stellar sequel just as much if not more.I'm giving ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" an excellent 9 out of 10 for its sheer, infectious fun-factor. Definitely go in with an open mind and give it a shot. Because take it from me... no matter what pre-conceived notions you might have, it'll defy your expectations in the best of ways!","1/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","nogodnomasters","31 December 2017","This is a sequel to the original film and not a reboot. Having watched the first film is not necessary to view this film. In fact not seeing it may be more helpful. In this film four students in detention get sucked into the game and must complete the game in order to return home from the jungle. What made the film good was the characters. It was a ""Breakfast Club"" type of thing where four teens discover themselves and overcome their fears and shortcomings to form a winning team. In the transformation they become opposite characters from what they are in real life with the self absorbed Bethany becoming Jack Black. The film had humor, action, drama, and a feel good ending. Take the family. Guide: No f-words, sex, or nudity. Worst on-screen kiss for 2017.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","ratari","22 April 2018","When I saw Jumanji in 1995 Starring Robin Williams, I was immediately swept away . It was non-stop action and fun. It was exhilarating. It was a wild entertaining ride!Now we come to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017). What can I say?
I like all of the actors. Special effects were great. That's where it just comes to a slow boring, dying, disappointing halt. A few jokes were funny, I'll admit. A good action, comedy HAS TO KEEP YOU OFF BALANCE! That is a must. You have to feel like you just don't know what surprise is around the corner. It has to keep you on the edge of your seat, so to speak and it has keep you laughing. This film did neither. As I have often said, timing is everything in a movie. Dead spots are taboo. A well written and well edited film keeps it moving with constant, ongoing discovery.
This was more like a committee got together and decided to ""get a few throw pillows and some paint and make a movie"".
It felt like each scene was painfully contrived by amateurs. Too many dead spots.Most reviewers here thought it was great. I have to respectfully disagree and go against the grain. I make no apologies.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Misstumbler","22 December 2017","I actually come to watch this movie with low expectation. I watched 1st Jumanji and it was really great (and I watched it a couple times). The sequel is a little different with it's successor, with the theme is still same, a game that involved real adventures to it's player. Four teenagers sucked into the game, and they become a character they chose (which is very different from their real life). The movie is so funny, and if you played RPGs game you will find this really entertaining. The humour is still suitable for young audiences, so it's a family movie too. And while it's a humour adventures movie, it still have a good message. So I really recommend it, hope you'll enjoy it too.","7/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","kirbylee70-599-526179","29 March 2018","Back in 1995 a movie came out that featured a board game as its centerpiece. Starring Robin Williams the movie told the story of a boy with a secret that is sucked into the world of the game only to be released years later when two more children began playing the same board game. When word came out that the movie, treasured by fans around the world, was being remade those fans were not quite sure what to expect. Rest easy because JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is just as wild, just as adventurous and just as much fun as the original.But no one plays board games these days right? The movie opens in 1996 and that's the case when a young teen named Alex tosses the board game aside to play his video games. The next day he looks at the case again to see it is now a video game, begins playing and disappears from this world.Fast forward to the present and a group of 4 teens are sent to detention. Spencer, the class nerd, and Fridge, the star ball player, are in trouble for Spencer doing Fridge's homework. Bethany is a self-absorbed young girl who lives on her cell phone, so much she had it on during a test. And Martha is a self-styled outcast sent here because she argued with a teacher. All are there for Saturday detention and instructed to clean out a storage room. But they find the old Jumanji game, hook it up to the TV and begin playing only to be sucked into the game just like Alex years ago.When they arrive in the jungle it takes them a while to realize what is going on. Spencer is now a muscle bound adventurer and played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Fridge is his sidekick and responsible for carrying a backpack with his weapons and played by Kevin Hart. Martha has turned into a fighting machine ala Laura Croft and played by Karen Gillian. And Bethany is now a knowledgeable professor played by Jack Black. Once they acclimate themselves to their predicament a transport arrives to pick them up.Driving the vehicle is Nigel, in reality a part of the game who is there to pass along information to the group and set them on their way. He tells them the story of an evil adventurer and Spencer's rival Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) who stole a famed jewel from the eye of a jaguar statue plunging Jumanji into darkness. Their task is to retrieve the jewel and take it back to be replaced in the statue. But there are several tasks involved along the way just like any game requires.Each learns about their strengths and weaknesses before they set out. They also find out the hard way what the stripes that seem to be tattooed on their arms mean. Each one is a life they have while playing the game. Lose a life, lose a stripe. And when they're all gone, its game over for that person.The thing that makes this film work is the interplay between the actors on screen as well as the alterations in their characters from the real world to the world of Jumanji. Spencer's 180 change has him looking at his arms and amazed at how big they are. Martha can't figure out why she's wearing such skimpy clothes in the jungle. Fridge can't believe he's little more than a sidekick. And Bethany bemoans her frumpy appearance and the loss of her much loved cell phone. But they all adapt while teasing one another about their changes.The acting from all four is wonderful to watch. For me Jack Black has always been hit or miss and he hits in this role, especially when he has to go to the bathroom. Gillian gets a chance to shine after her makeup laden role in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. Hart and Johnson, so amazing together in CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE, are just as good here. Johnson in particular shines in his comedic moments, especially when he gives a smoldering look.The effects are solid here and almost all CGI. But they're done well enough that it doesn't matter unlike some films that rely on those effects while doing them poorly. They play well into the story here and that story is solid enough to make you realize this isn't a remake so much as a reboot of the original.I found myself laughing throughout the film as well as cheering on the team making their way through the game. While there are a few jokes that adults will enjoy more than kids, they're not the sort that will be offensive and have you trying to explain them to the young ones. All in all I had a blast with this one and odds are I'll watch it again. My guess is you will as well.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","danjamz","11 December 2017","This sequel took so long to come to fruition, the most unbelievable thing is that the writing could still be so bad. It genuinely feels like they cast the actors first, then wrote supposedly ""cool and funny"" scenes about them, making it feel more like a bunch of unconnected sketches and action sequences than a real story.The main problem is that the humour seemed almost entirely aimed at the handful of young kids in my (very busy) screening, they loved it of course; but literally everyone else... silence for the entire movie. The special effects are fine and the action sequences exciting enough, but without a half-decent story to hold it together, it all feels a bit empty. Ultimately keep your expectations rock bottom and you can probably just go along for the ride. But 22 years after the original, I would highly recommend you give the old one another try before you bother with this.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","MihaiSorinToma","19 September 2018","Four very different teenagers are sucked into a video game and transported to the world of Jumanji. Each equipped with an unique set of skills but also weaknesses, they must find a way to finish the game before remaining out of lives in order to go back to their own world.It's a movie which follows about the same concept as the original flick, but also improving it in terms of visual effects. The four new characters are very likeable and funny, playing their part very well in the adventure that follows. Their evolution as teenagers and their relationship with one another is also presented in detail, presenting how each is able to overcome his condition with the help of the others. Their part is the most important, very well played by the actors, contributing decisively to the outcome. Using plenty of references to video games, this movie manages to create a very entertaining atmosphere in which the action can take part. Speaking of which, we have plenty of it, exaggerated of course as they are part of a video game, but still very enjoyable.The plot isn't much as far as the game is concerned, but it is good enough to keep it all together and make it a very good all-rounder. It's not predictable or linear, even having a mystery to be guessed, but it's not breath-taking either. It excels though through dialog, character complexity and development, making it very good in this department. The visual effects however are top notch. It truly is a delight for the eyes to see all the action sequences and all other events which are made possible using CGI.It's a movie which I truly enjoyed. It manages to create a good time for its viewers, while having some great actors who play their characters with style. It's not spectacular in terms of story but it makes up through action, suspense, CGI and even a bit of drama. A very good watch overall.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","BA_Harrison","28 December 2017","I wasn't expecting anything from Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle other than some light-hearted Hollywood escapism, and that's exactly what I got: a couple of hours of pure popcorn entertainment with a predictable message to be comfortable with who you are and make the most of your life.A sequel to the original 1995 film (not a remake!), the film sees four high-schoolers tasked with cleaning up a classroom, where they find an old video console, loaded with a cartridge: Jumanji. Setting up the game, they each take a controller and choose a character, after which they are sucked into the world of Jumanji, where they become their avatars.Nerd Spencer (Alex Wolff) becomes musclebound adventurer Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson); meek Martha (Morgan Turner) becomes kick-ass babe Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan); shallow beauty Bethany (Madison Iseman) becomes middle-aged, overweight cartographer Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black); and jock Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) becomes short zoologist Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart). To escape the game, the players must work their way through the various levels and return a jewel, the Jaguar's Eye, to its rightful place in a huge statue.Aimed at the whole family, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is equal parts action and comedy, and largely succeeds in both areas, with some great gags (Jack Black, for once, manages to be funny and not throughly annoying) and several well-mounted set-pieces, the best of which involves a stampede of rhinos and a damaged helicopter. Of course, things work out exactly the way you imagine they will, but although there are few genuine surprises, the film still manages to be quite the thrill-ride.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Aaron1375","26 December 2017","First off, I was not the biggest fan of the first movie with Robin Williams. It was not bad, but just did not click for me. When I first heard about this film, I had no desire to see it; however, when I saw the trailer and saw that it was now a video game and the people became their avatars I thought I would give it a go. Suffice to say, it was a rather amusing and action filled adventure that I was not disappointed in at all. Not the best film I have seen all year, but still rather good. I figured the whole video game setting would make it more enjoyable for me than the whole crazy stuff happening in the real world setting of the first film. The film is a mixture of comedy and action as I would say it is nearly a 50/50 split with maybe a dash more on the comedy side. The cast all did a good job as the actors and actress playing the avatars within the game all were able to pick up on the teens who they supposedly were traits very nicely and made up a lot of the comedy in this film. The story has the Jumanji game found on a beach. A young man picks it up and opens it up, but immediately dismisses it and goes to playing video games. Something happens within the night and the board game becomes a video game and soon the young man disappears. Years later, a nerdy guy, an athlete, a popular hot girl and a bit of an awkward girl get detention. They are charged with cleaning out a room, but happen across the video game Jumanji. They soon decide to play and each of them is plunged into the game and become the avatar they have chosen. The nerdy kid is now a brave and muscular explorer. The athlete a small and diminutive zoologist and backpack carrier. The awkward girl becomes a very attractive and hot video game heroine and the popular girl becomes an overweight professor and reader of maps! They are charged with getting a strange jewel back to where it belongs; however, they have limited lives and seemingly unlimited dangers awaiting them in the jungles of Jumanji. They have to cross the dreaded jungles, get through a bazaar and try to outsmart the villain of the piece and try to stop themselves from being killed in the process! The actors in this all do a really good job as they make the film. If not for the way they act, this would be kind of just another generic jungle action piece. Dwayne Johnson continues to be a solid actor and still the best wrestler turned actor as he has to play a guy who looks huge, but the actual person being a very insecure and scared individual. Karen Gillian does a really good job at being super hot and sexy, but also extremely awkward. Kevin Hart is very funny, but the actor that stole the show was Jack Black as the professor who the popular and self absorbed girl became as he actual seems like he is that girl. They all are what make this movie extremely good and funny. The villain though is bit of a throwaway, almost seeming to be no threat at all. So I enjoyed the film, at times I thought it did get a bit too serious and I did think it ran a bit long, but overall I really enjoyed it. I think it is the only non comic film I have seen so far this year at the theaters other than John Wick 2. The first film just was not for me, but I enjoyed this sequel quite a bit. I do classify it as a sequel and not a reboot as it is just a new setting as the game itself has evolved over time to become something new. The actors were great and though the ones playing the avatars are in the majority of the film, the ones playing the 'real' them were really good too. The film had a mixture of comedy and action, but though it was nearly even I would still say that at its core it is more of a comedy film. It was a nice change of pace and I enjoyed watching it with my parents and they enjoyed it as well so well done to Sony for making a very enjoyable film.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Paragon240","2 January 2023","The sequel no one saw coming or expected to light up the box office as it did! Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun adventure film with hilarious characters that works in every way. I will be honest; I was not a fan of the original movie - it freaked me out as a child. But the new film minimized the horror elements of Jumanji and focused more on adventure and humor. This time instead of a board game, Jumanji has morphed into a video game that sucks its unsuspecting victims into its deadly world. Welcome to the Jungle leans into all the video game tropes with hilarious results with jokes about skills, lives, NPCs, boss battles, and more. The movie is at its best with all the humor surrounding the body-swapped teens dealing with the game's characters they now inhabit - the skinny nerd becoming the muscular hero, the jock becoming a tiny sidekick, and the funniest of all, the pretty popular girl becoming Jack Black (who is the real stand out of the film). Jumanji is a must-see family adventure film that brings fun and laughs to everyone who dares to play the game.","9/10"

This movie is so funny and barely anything compared to the 1995 version! Such a crazy adventure that seems to have a high budget, I guess that's ok sometimes better than most Transformers films.

A very good fantasy as well as adventure comedy movie.I remember an old jumanji movie of 1995 but this one is far better than that.The movie is about the four kid who accidentally found an old game that took them into the world of game and full of quest to perform. Gamers will find it very exciting as these four kid runs through different experiences and missions to keep them alive. The movie moves forward along with the same pace of the game and finally reveals it's final stage.The actions are quite acceptable. Some comedy scenes are very very amusing. Dwayne johnson has done really well along with his other three companions.This is not a serious type of movie at all. So please don't watch it seriously.Rather seat and watch it for fun.

At the beginning I thought ""Oh It's The Breakfast Club"" stuck in a fantasy world.Now I will say ""That is still partially true"" but what this film is rarely hits a false note. It was lots of fun with a huge heart.Set twenty-one years after the first film, the plot follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji, playing as the characters they chose.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","jtindahouse","18 March 2018","'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is a surprisingly well made and well executed film. I'll admit I had very little hope for it going in. I wasn't a big fan of the original and I'm not a big fan of Kevin Hart's brand of humour. I had almost no anticipation for the film whatsoever. It started out a little slowly (there's maybe a 15 minute period before the big stars actually come into the movie), but after that it kicked into gear and was a very fun two hour ride. The set up for the film is done perfectly. The lull at the start is completely necessary and makes every thing so much better later on. Knowing who these characters are before going into the game compared to what they become once they're in there is the best thing the film has going for it. Jack Black's character arc in particular is especially hilarious. In fact in what was an incredibly strong performance by the entire cast Black would have to be my stand out. Dwayne Johnson continues to be Hollywood's most improved comedian. Compare what he achieves now to his work early in his career and it's worlds apart. These days he's almost becoming a sure sign of quality. Kevin Hart was the surprise for me. I rarely enjoy his work, but here he was hilarious. Whoever wrote his one-liners did a fantastic job. They were almost always effective. The whole movie is just put together very well. The three lives per character structure was very clever and allowed so much freedom for the story to progress. Also I loved that there was no mucking around with the aspect of getting them into the game. They're in quickly and boom, the fun can begin. Too many films draw this process out in an attempt to be clever or create believability. I would happily recommend 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' to anyone looking for a good laugh and a fun time.","7/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","jeannefrancoise","2 January 2018","Dear readers, Jumanji is part of my childhood memories. I love the movie and the Jumanji 2017 movie is really fun, especially the characters and many funny scenes that make me laugh until my popcorn scrambling. Dwayne Johnson can do mimiques of face like a teenager. The plot is ordinary, about to conquer a quest of game, but the adventure is never boring. I appreciate the Director of Casting who can search the faces of all actors similar to the faces of game characters, this is miraculous.The only weakness that I found in Jumanji 2017 movie is that the core story itself: how can people get into the game. This is super imaginative and that part also makes us curious about the game business with the question of such: ""can we really doing game like in reality?"" and if yes, ""could we comeback?"" The final scene is also quite fiction for me, but I hope Jumanji 2017 movie can be an eternal movie like Home Alone or Air Buddy and every time we watch it, never boring.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","thepriceofpayne","16 December 2019","""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is actually a welcome surprise from a studio who's had some franchise issues recently. The film works as a semi-sequel, homage, and reboot of the Robin Williams classic, and successfully makes an entertaining adventure featuring wonderful performances from Karen Gillian, Dwayne Johnson, the scene stealing Jack Black, and Kevin Hart (despite the fact he's playing himself). This film is a fun and exciting Jungle adventure that will give you just the right amount of nostalgia while also creating something new and inviting, even if the writing can be standard at times.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","pensman","7 January 2018","I like Jack Black but he's running his niche character a little thin. He made King Kong (2005) bearable, and was perfect in Tropic Thunder, and I liked the semi-serious turn in The Holiday. Here like in most of his films, he helps with the comic turns but in an usual way that almost makes this his movie. Kevin Hart plays Kevin Hart. The Rock likewise plays the Rock. In this turn the game is amped up to being a video game but you know the drill. It's a pretty much mindless romp that I would have waited to see on HBO or Netflix but that a friend had passes. I guess I am tired of CGI and loud booms and plotless films. I suspect if you are under thirty you will enjoy this and have some laughs but the studios are really pushing Jumanji to the breaking point but I'm sure they will squeeze another film out of this franchise depending on the profits. I am beginning to wish Hollywood would start on the road to bankruptcy already with the endless repetitions.","9/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","scifi-97852","4 December 2018","I'm going to be flat honest, I went into this movie expecting not to enjoy it. It's a sequel 20 years later to a movie I really, really loved. And not to mention that Robin Williams made such a huge impact on my childhood and has sadly since passed, meaning anything anyone did would have to ultimately be compared to his original work, I expected to be tearing this movie apart.I expected to be doing that.But I'm not.Everyone in this movie really loved this movie and it came through. And they obviously loved the original too. They didn't try to reinvent the wheel, but instead redesigned it to fit a new vehicle. The game was still the game but in a new way that was still dated (feeling old and new at the same time) just like a game that is mysterious and possibly ancient should be. The characters chemistry worked well together, these guys are obviously friends on set and probably off too. And the dynamics of the story felt appropriate for kids my this generation, just like the dynamics felt right in the first movie for my generation.In the end I found myself laughing and saying aww and yes, even falling for the smoulderingly a time or two. If you go into this looking for a faithful remake of the first film you're going to be sorely disappointed. But if you're looking for a sequel done by people who obviously loved the original and wanted to continue the fascinating and amazing world of Jumanji, it's well worth it.","4/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","rebeccalucy","20 December 2017","A surprisingly good continuation of this series, with some good humour and a modern update with a twist. The acting is decent, with the rock and Kevin Hart giving better performances than usual. But Karen Gillan and Jack Black supplied most of the great comedy in the film. Jack had to portray a very stereotypical popular girl, but he gives it all he has got and adds some much needed heart. However, the villian is very under used and bland. Bobby Canavale did not have any time to develop his character, so he does seem as such a big threat.I really enjoyed the video game update, with the multiple lives they allow for urgency and a little comedy. They definitely use the video game idea to their advantage, but it could become a little dated in the future. Also, some of the comedy falls flat and could become dated also. Such as the constant references to technology. The cinematography and editing is basic but that obviously wasn't the focus. Some of the backgrounds are beautiful with the lush jungle. However the CGI could use a little more work considering the amount it is used. Overall, a fun update to Jumanji work at least one watch!","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Ishaan_Bhatnagar","1 January 2018","Jumanji killed the viewer with its boring and but obvious elements. The script is not interesting at all, useless punches to make comedy, unnecessary CGI and Visual Effects. The villain of the movie and the different levels of the game (if considered so) should have been worked upon. Gaming Industry brings you a wide scope of adding elements of entertainment and this movie seems to be a nothing more than a coin gamebox.
The Rock fans are going to applaud his appearance but we have already seen him doing helicopter stunts previously. This movie is not worthy option to be viewed in cinemas.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","AngelHonesty","10 February 2020","I was worried that this movie would never measure up to the original, since the first Jumanji was a masterpiece of fun, but I was met with pleasant surprise. Instead of trying to redo something that didn't need redoing, they took the movie in a different direction, letting the viewer enter the jungle of Jumanji.The cast in this film was amazing! The jokes were perfect and suited the characters perfectly. No one else could have pulled this off but Jack Black, The Rock and Kevin Hart.The downfalls of the movie was that the CGI was terrible, the film dragged on a little with constant action scenes and there's absolutely no depth to the show. But over all the faults were made up by the humor. If you looking for something light, family expectable and full of fun laughs, defiantly give this one a try.","9/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","JackCowart34","13 July 2022","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is technically a sequel, but is perfectly capable of standing alone as one of the most effectively paced, smartly written, and conceptually engrossing adventure films released in recent years. The actors that play the four main characters have fantastic chemistry and impressive comedic timing. Each of them were given a difficult task of playing against type, excluding Kevin Hart who virtually plays the same character you've seen him as in countless other movies. As far as supporting actors go, Bobby Cannavale clearly had a good time playing the villain. The jungle setting provides beautiful scenery, and Kasdan uses CGI relatively sparingly, but rather effectively. The dialogue was hysterically witty, and the fight scenes were well choreographed. The only time the film seemed to drag was in the first twenty minutes before they had entered the game. Regardless, that's a somewhat minute problem for a film that more than makes up for the slow setup in the ensuing ninety minutes.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","vesil_vesalier","31 March 2018","I love being surprised by movies, don't you?I've said before that expectations destroy movies, and I still hold that it's true. But what's interesting is having LOW expectations of movies. Then, when you go in expecting to hate every freaking scene in the film, you're pleased when there are things about it you liked.In the case of what I guess is classified as a ""Reboot"" (although having an Easter Egg planted right smack in the middle of the movie that tells you otherwise means it's a sequel), JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE was an absolute riot.I liked the original JUMANJI, but I never fell in love with it. Robin Williams was excellent because honestly, even in amazingly bad films such as TOYS, it wasn't Robin I was irritated with. Guys like him always push it as hard as they can, but they can't do more than what they're stuck to work with.Comparing the two, I would say that what truly was lacking in the original was a definitive sense of humor. Trying to balance humor and drama is tough, VERY tough, because the themes don't generally mix together. One usually dominates over the other, making one the flavor while the other is the main course. In the first JUMANJI, it wasn't demanding enough to be scary, and it wasn't funny enough to be hilarious.While I won't say that WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is scary in any way, it does at least TRY to have a more pressing urgency to it. The original wasn't terribly clear on the more interesting rules of the game: if one of the players died, for REAL, what would have happened? It's presumed, based on the theme of the film, that it's not possible for the players to die. Here, coming up with a definite penalty system, clearly illustrated early on in the predicament of the four students stuck in Jumanji, the pressure is on. It's delivered with humor, but it's there, and it keeps you guessing throughout the film as to what exactly Game Over would be, when somebody fails.One of the most shining moments of the film has to be the main cast, acting as if they were the teenagers that inhabit their bodies. On the comedy side, nobody can beat Jack Black, who is the avatar of the popular cellphone-obsessed white teenage girl, reacting and over-reacting to the fact that she's now an overweight, middle-aged pudgy white dude. Dwayne Johnson also shines here, stretching his acting muscles to emulate the leader of the gang, as they try to team up and make their way through Jumanji. Karen Gillan, whom I've never had the pleasure of seeing in anything before now, was also hilarious in her own way, her avatar being the opposite of the teenager that's stuck inside of her. And Kevin Hart, the man who makes comedy as a profession, is good, but strangely outplayed here, delivering yuks but never really stealing the show. On the dramatic side, the film never does take itself too seriously, but I believe it to be one of its strengths. The main drama comes from the ticking of the clock, from the pressure of racing toward the ending without assurances that everything's going to be okay. If you want a criticism, I will give you two of them: I'm not sure if the kids who start out the movie are acting poorly, or acting poorly on purpose. I think it's the latter, where the director knew he'd have less screen time with them than with their avatars, so he needed a way to kind of... over-identify their personalities early on, so you could see Dwayne and co. pull off such great jobs at emulating them. I THINK that's the reason. Because honestly, the first part of this movie was, for me, the toughest to get through.Secondly, the villain's scenes seemed unnecessary, most of the time. The team could have been fighting Jumanji as a semi-formed background filled with enemies, and it would have been just as effective. The heavy, whose character is a nod to the original JUMANJI, feels out of place here, without a real definitive character or personality of any kind.Overall, however, I had a blast with this film, and I laughed myself to tears through a lot of it. I don't remember having NEARLY as much fun with the original. The marketeers want to call this a ""reboot"", and I see, according to IMDb, that the studios are already gearing up for what's listed as ""JUMANJI 2"", but I don't care what the marketeers are saying, cause it's just not true. This was a SEQUEL to the original, and it lives in that rarest of categories where it was much better than the original.And that's where I will leave it. The review, I mean. Because I'd love to get my hands on this movie, and add it to my collection.","9/10"

There was great action scenes, some humorous bits of dialogue and enough of a plot to keep things moving.This is obviously not very deep (which was exactly what I was after) fairly predictable and does play to stereotypes - but none of that matters.If you are after some easy family fun then is perfect!

These four high school students, get pulled into a video game called Jumanji. They also get turned into their respective game avatars. Now, Spencer(Dwayne Johnson), Fridge(Kevin Hart), Bethany(Jack Black) & Martha(Karen Gillan) have to finish the game, to return to the real world. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a thoroughly entertaining film. Director Jake Kasdan has successfully introduced Jumanji to a new generation, while also honoring the 1995 Robin Williams classic. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is immersive(especially in IMAX). The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. My favorites are the helicopter scene & the climax. The effortless camaraderie among the four main cast members is another strong-point of the film. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Spencer. Kevin Hart is hysterical as Fridge. Jack Black is hilarious as Bethany. Karen Gillan is outstanding as Martha. Together, Johnson, Hart, Black & Gillan make the audience guffaw uncontrollably, with their histrionics. Rhys Darby is impressive as Nigel. Bobby Cannavale is great as Van Pelt. Nick Jonas is amazing as Alex. Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman & Morgan Turner are awesome as Young Spencer, Young Fridge, Young Bethany & Young Martha, respectively. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a must watch, for fans of Jumanji(1995) & newcomers alike. Go & have a great time with your entire family!","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","xherridea","14 July 2020","I quite enjoyed this film. I admit I don't have much nostalgia to the original so I went in as basically a blank slate and thought it was a nice family film. I don't think it's the best option but it's jokes usually land and the action scenes are fun. I think the general storyline is kind of weak and some of the jokes aren't that good, also it's pretty predictable and the main characters are a little annoying. But overall it's alright","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","garthlotel","25 February 2018","This movie delivers lots of laughs and great pacing, decent action and special effects. The stereotypical characters are a let down, especially the token female who only gets to be sexy (come on, it's 2018). But if you look past the shortcomings, you will be able to enjoy Jack Black's funniest role in a while.","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","n-kefala","7 January 2018","""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is a light-hearted, easy-to-watch action/comedy, that strikes the balance between referencing its nostalgic origins without being obnoxious. Also with a different take on the coming-of-age story, and a good dynamic between the five main actors. Mostly great fun, with Jack Black outrageously entertaining and Dwayne Johnson who is sweetly funny as the muscular incarnation of a nerd.
Like a video game, the narrative lacks any character development, relying on chases and the fear of death. But all-in-all, the rebooted version of ""Jumanji"" remains a fun-family film to watch over the year and I think without a doubt, will bring more productions as soon as possible.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","namashi_1","21 December 2017","A standalone sequel to the 1995 classic 'Jumanji', 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' never comes close to its evergreen hit, but is entertaining nonetheless. With an exciting theme, brisk pacing & a scene-stealing Jack Black performance, this Christmas Biggie is the one you should watch with your family this weekend. 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji, and, playing as the characters they chose, must beat the game in order to return to the real world.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' rises on the strength of its perfectly done casting. Dwayne Johnson is charming & likable, playing an against type role of a guy who's scared of almost everything around him. Its good to see the Hollywood A-Lister take on a role that is completely opposite to his general buff image. Kevin Hart, too, is game & raises some laughs as the guy with the backpack. Karen Gillan is sexy & shows skill for some kick-ass action, especially her when she dances while beating up the bad-guys. But its Jack Black, who steals the show. His character, a girl in reality, is a riot. His feminine body-language as well as his dialogue delivery, to his hilarious reaction of having a penis, is laugh-out-loud funny. Black is in great comedic form, proving once again that he can land a joke better than most comedians working in Hollywood today. Its a performance that's bound to get the most laughs & claps. Nick Jonas charms in his part too. And the kids back in reality, bring earnestness to their parts. The rest of 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is pure fun. The pacing is brisk, the action is sharp, the comic moments of its 4 principal characters are mostly on point & the visuals are sure to please the kids. Its a big-budgeted blockbuster, that does the genre right, by never being anything else but a popcorn entertainer. If I had to count on the flaws, however, it would be the villain here, played by a one-note Bobby Cannavale, who comes across as a baddie only there to exist for the sake of a villain. But that's me asking too much from a family-movie, that actually entertains, despite its flaws.With Co-Writer & Director Jake Kasdan catching the pulse of this blockbuster & excellent Cinematography by Gyula Pados, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' offers a good time at the movies. Go, enjoy!","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","YoniSade","2 January 2018","What a waste of my time and money.
I should've trusted my instincts about the trailer and clips to not to set foot in the cinema watching this crap.
Unfunny recycled jokes, lame story and kindergarden level villain.
Jumanji suppose to be exciting, emotional, funny and a little scary, but this movie failed to achieve none of it.
The screenwriters probably wrote the script in the bathroom on toilet paper and forgot to wipe with it their ass.
 
Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are from now on my official kryptonite. Arnold S. had more charisma than both of them together.
Even Jack Black who I dig, gave a goosebumps level performance.Robin Williams is probably turning in his grave.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","soumyadeepkoley","7 April 2018","First of all, the acting skills of Karen Gillan and Kevin Hart deserve a standing ovation. Kevin Hart was absolutely in his best self in this movie. The superb cast of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart coupled with Karen Gillan's beauty makes this movie most interesting. Once you are into it, you can't help but notice the stunning visuals; thanks to the Kualoa Ranch private nature reserve, where the movie was filmed. The storyline is excellent, with every detail taken care of - right from how swash plates of a helicopter blade control the pitch of the blades, creating thrust, to how game environments often defy real world physics. The slapstick humour adds to the comical charm of this wonderful movie - a mind freshener for the whole family.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","HorrorFanatic4Life","3 March 2019","I was hesitant to watch this as it seemed to have been overly advertised and just got sick of hearing about it and I've also never been a huge fan of Jack Black, but he has instantly turned me into a fan after watching this! Don't doubt me when I say this movie is worth the 2 hours and the money spent. It is nothing like the original, so don't expect that. But I will say I like it better than the original, which is hard to do these days. Jack Black nailed his character of a teenage, social-media-driven girl and had me laughing with almost every word he spoke. The rest of the cast added their humour as well which just made it an amazingly funny movie overall. It's not one that is so focused on the plot as much as it is just being plain funny, which is alright with me and great for anyone looking for a good laugh.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","tinovalkki","25 December 2017","22 years ago released original Jumanji with Robin Williams wasn't as big success as makers expected. Even it wasn't so big box office magnet it has still become a movie classic. Maybe that is a reason who we were have to wait the sequel so long. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is not exactly a sequel even it start where last movie ended. More it is a original story, not re-filming. Because the original movie is such a classic this could be a catastrophic. It is good to see, that it isn't. Even this is not something big movie history, it is still quite enjoyable adventure movie. Script is quite stupid, but has enough of strengths to hold the story together. It is very solid two hour movie experience and timing is strict enough to to keep you oriented. Great effects combined with good storytelling is satisfying enough. Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black are fun to watch. Well timing action with great effects makes this movie quite enjoyable to watch. It may not be any movie classic, but surely it is fun to watch.","3/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","fciocca","28 February 2020","For a person that watched several times the original Jumanji movie, I found this production an insult. Characters are really annoying and completely cliché. There is the strong guy, the nerd, the hot girl and the wannabe funny guy. I don't understand why ruining an old classic tha made dream when I was a child, rebooting the franchise more than 20 years later.I cannot judge the story, as I did not finish to watch, but the movie does not hook me up. This is just another case of Hollywood trying hard to squeeze an amazing 90s franchise, just to earn as much money as possible. I will try to finish the movie, but this will be painful.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","editionsnl","31 December 2017","Using the washroom after viewing this movie had me more on the edge of my seat than the film itself. Average cinematography, the characters were stereotypical and boring, the plot was highly predictable and trite (as in, there was no part of the entire movie that caught me off guard or that I didn't expect), and the scenes that were apparently meant to be suspenseful or exciting were not. The film was full of cheesy, forced dialogue and pointless romantic subplots (one of my biggest pet peeves in action/adventure movies). It did have a few funny moments, which is just about the only thing that made me give it higher than a 1/10 rating.It's not the worst thing I've seen in my life, and to be fair I don't usually watch this genre of movie (it was the one my cousin wanted to see), but around halfway through I definitely was bored and looking forward to the end. In hindsight, I wouldn't have spent $10 and two hours on this. It's probably an all right family movie or an appealing plot for a 12-year-old, but for me it was a total yawn.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Students_SimoneVeil","8 January 2019","It's four teens that are lost in a magic video game (JUMANJI) and the only way to escape is to cooperate to finish the game and go back to reality. I think that Dwayne Johnson (Spencer), Kevin Hart (Fridge), Jack Black (Bethany), Karen Gillan (Martha) and Nick Jonas (Alex) are so fantastic in their characters. This movie is the most mysterious, the most humorous, the most original because is a good cover and the funniest movie. And it is really little scary. Jake Kasdan was the best director for this movie. The special effects ars just really splendid and I liked are. It's the best movie I've ever seen. I recommend it 100% because it is the most captivating and the funniest movie in this world.","7/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","CatfishOpinions","20 July 2022","I usually have very very low expectations for these random action comedy movies that come out all the time. They're usually incredibly cringey, dull, unfunny or forgettable. But I was delighted to discover that this movie is not one of those.Really the only way to go about creating a sequel to Jumanji starring Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black is not to take yourself seriously. This movie only works because the entire time it is marveling at how stupid and over-the-top it is. They make fun of themselves, they mock the plot itself at points, and nothing in the story is taken too seriously. So you're both laughing AT the movie and WITH the movie. It knows that its own existence is pretty dumb. And that's how it's able to be fun instead of cringey!Also, the action is pretty good. Everything is exciting and fun and, like I said, very self-aware. The comedy is also actually pretty good for what you'd usually expect in these kinds of movies. Lots of the jokes were genuinely funny and the way all the actors made fun of themselves and hammed it up was pretty entertaining.So yes! Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a success in my book. I have lots of respect for it.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","namikazedante","30 December 2017","I really wanted to like this movie because after seeing the cast on 'The Graham Norton Show' they seemed to click so good together and they were so funny. So funny I was laughing really heard. But about the movie. It starts off exactly where the first one left off which is pretty amazing and awesome but after that great scene then the movie just spirals down to another 5/10 hollywood crap-fest. Filled with cliche moments, forced laughter and such cringe worthy moments I just had to look up into the ceiling because it was really terrible at times. True the movie has it moments and it is funny at times but the main plot is nothing like the original which I saw last week and it still holds up and that is a 8/10 movie even though it has some lame jokes here and there. But it's a truly amazing movie. But when it comes to this one. Sure it is entertaining and The cast is great but the movie is so poorly written and I was sitting there expecting a twist or something cool to happen but it's really lame if you compare it to the first movie which was and still is an amazing movie. The intro and build up of Alan Parrish story which seems like a Stephen King inspired moment, how it is filmed and the style and yeah everything. But nope I really wanted to like this movie but I can't give more than 5/10 because of all the terrible, cliche, cringe and hollywood nonsense it brings with it. And yes it is even a very weak 5/10. Disappointed.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","JoeytheBrit","6 May 2020","Enjoyable update of the old Robin Williams movie sees the board game replaced by an outdated video game, and gets plenty of mileage out of having the likes of Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black playing the teenagers who are trapped in their bodies while in the game.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","bobandlulureview","27 March 2018","Just as much as I love reading books, I enjoy watching movies too. It's a gene inherited from my parents. 
Now, besides watching movies in the theatres, I record movies on my set-top box and watch it at night, within the comfortable confines of our living room. 
I have new found company for animated films in my five year old. (Though, I really think he comes just for the popcorn). I record movies for Arjun as well and he has now slowly graduated to watching non-animated children's films like Home Alone, Baby's Day Out, Dunston Checks In, Zathura etc. I recently made him watch Jumanji (Part 1) on TV and he seemed to like it. 
And what do you know! Part 2 had hit the theatres. I wasn't even aware of a sequel until I heard it on the radio. I screeched in delight and looked around in the car at the other passengers. My parents had suddenly something very important to discuss and my husband began avoiding eye contact. Arjun looked at me and said ""we'll go driving"". Please note that I have recently started driving and shall do another post reviewing the Alto K10 automatic car. 
I LOVED (still do) Jumanji. I couldn't wait to watch the sequel and dish it. Sequels rarely match up to the original. We went to a nondescript mall closest to our house that had the most convenient timing, post lunch. Not expecting a jam packed theatre, I decided to book tickets at the counter. Bad decision, as the only seats available was at the first row. 
I was a bit disappointed thinking Arjun would have to strain his neck, looking up at the screen, the whole time. We grabbed our 3D glasses. Arjun wasn't pleased with his small ""baby glasses"". Since we'd just had lunch, I had to pull the drooling 5 year old away from the popcorn counter with the promise of cheese popcorn during the ""intermission"". The couple walking towards our seat was wondering why I was giving them dirty looks. They plonked themselves next to us with their gigantic tub of popcorn! (Exaggerated eye-roll) 
Arjun is very loud in theatres. He waits for the theatre to quieten before he can make his proclamation to the public. ""I am very very hungry, you haven't given me anything to eat"" said Arjun looking at our neighbours' popcorn. Thankfully, the screen lit up and the trailers of the upcoming films began. It started off with the Akshay Kumar starrer 'Padman'. The audience drowned in laughter, the trailer was funny. Arjun waited for his moment and loudly asked, ""This is not a Batman, this is a Padman, but what is a Pad?"" Everyone burst out laughing again. Arjun was pleased and with that he forgot his popcorn. 
REVIEW BEGINS HERE: The movie begins with a kid inserting a cartridge into a video game console and my heart sank a little. I have no patience for spotty high school kids and how dare they change the game from a board game to a video game. Are all these millennials too cool for board games!
The movie proceeds with four high school kids being sucked into the game's setting into the world of Jumanji where they don on their respective video game avatars. This is where Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes his entry which was met with a lot of hoots and cat calls in the theatre and a ""Why are you screaming now"" from Arjun. The four characters are then enlisted to return the jewel, 'Jaguar's eye' to a gigantic rocky Jaguar statue. The movie follows their journey from their entry into the game all the way up till the statue. The path is trodden with hurdles thrown in by Russel Van Pelt, a hunter, who wants the jewel for himself in order to be able to control the animals of Jumanji. Each player has three lives, losing all of which would mean death. This is a typical action-adventure film and it reminded me of a light hearted version of Hunger Games. 
The 3D effects are superb and the effect was much more pronounced being in the first row. The movie is HILARIOUS, the actors are funny especially Jack Black and Kevin Hart. The five year old had his eyebrows up and mouth wide open so I am presuming he enjoyed it too. At the risk of sounding unfaithful to Robin Williams, Dwayne did an excellent job as the protagonist, Dr. Smolder Bravestone. 
Yes, I would record this movie when it comes on TV and watch it again.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","markymarc-1","8 December 2017","I saw the original numerous times and enjoyed that but the poor CGI always ruined it for me. I had some trepidation about going to see this but an Amazon Prime early screening ticket made me watch it.I don't regret it, as it was enjoyable fun, made me laugh a few times and had decent CGI which did not take me out of the movie. The leads had great comedic talent and I liked the way that they made me feel like they actually were in other people's bodies. It was a bonus to see one of my favorite actors appear mid movie. The only quibble I have is that the bad guy was a let down. I kept waiting for him to show his powers and be a great threat and expecting a big ""boss"" fight but sadly it did not happen. Also the Transport Hanger was built up as hard level to beat and it was not. They easily outnumbered the guards who were defeated by a single character. I'm glad they decided at the end that this would not have a sequel. When you see the scene you will know what I mean. All in all, a great piece of entertainment with great action, adventure and comedy.","9/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","bowmanblue","1 January 2018","...but it probably helps! Direct sequels to films that are released a loooong time after the original don't have a tendency to do that well at the Box Office ('Basic Instinct 2' - anyone remember that?). Most times it appears that the original fan-base isn't in the cinema-going demographic and the film doesn't click with today's audience. However, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' not only does well to differentiate itself from the original, but also succeeds without the inclusion of the man who (arguably) helped make the first instalment so special - the ever excellent Robin Williams.'Jumanji' was about a magic board game that sucked players in and made them play the game 'for real' in order to survive. Well, in this day and age, the producers of the film obviously realise that no self-respecting kid would ever play a board game any more (sadly, in my opinion - I love a bit of Monopoly!) so they've brought it right up to date and turned the board game into a computer game. So, when four high school students find themselves in detention cleaning out the school's dusty basement, they stumble across the 'antique' console and decide to kill some time playing a quick game (this never happened to the 'Breakfast Club' did it?!).Now, this is where the film gets a bit different. The first ten to fifteen minutes are spent introducing us - the audience - to our young heroes. However, as soon as they enter the computer game, all of them acquire 'avatars' i.e. in-game characters who are all older, hunkier and possessing skills required for completing the game. Therefore, pretty much the entire film is spent with the kids' 'adult' incarnations, but seeing as one such incarnation is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, that's not so bad. So, our young heroes quickly become 'old' heroes and have to save a fictional jungle-land from a tyrannical regime. I guess that's a pretty standard plot for either a modern action film or a computer game. I suppose that's what this film is - a standard action film and it's enjoyable enough if that's all you're looking for or expecting. However, if you're a fan of computer games and the clichés that come with the medium, you'll get a lot more out of it than just a few action set pieces. It does brilliantly at poking fun of all the silly things you can expect from video games - everything from entering the game with three 'lives' to owning a backpack which can seemingly fit numerous ridiculously-large items in and never slow its owner down.But, however many 'in-jokes' are included for us gamers and no matter how impressive the action scenes are, the film would be nothing without the stars and I have to hand it to the four (adult) actors who take the reigns for the majority of the film. It's because of them that this film succeeds, for they don't just have to play 'their' characters - they have to play their teenage incarnations playing adult characters who are, in turn, playing clichéd computer game characters. And, as much as I love Dwayne Johnson in everything he does, I have to say that the star of the show is Jack Black. This is because he's - technically - playing a spoilt teenage girl. No, seriously. And he does it perfectly, stealing every scene as he goes. Also, you may not expect much 'character development' in a film about kids being drawn into a computer game, but I thought there was actually a decent enough 'journey' for the youngsters (albeit in their adult bodies!) to go on and they ended their story as different people to how they began it.So, if you're only looking for a run-of-the-mill action film to put your brain on hold to, then you'll certainly find it here. However, if, like me, you're a gamer and want to see a film that lovingly pokes fun at everything we hold dear, you'll definitely find that here to. Special mention to something that happens at the end. I expected something to happen between a pair of characters and it didn't. Something more 'realistic' happened instead and I found myself awarding 'kudos points' to the film's writers for not taking the predictable route at the end.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","jackstonestone","9 March 2022","So jumanji welcome to the jungle is a movie about characters that get in trouble at school and then they find a video game that has existed for a very long period of time from the electrical engineering portion of the school this game was put away on the bottom of a table and then by some accident they figured out that this video game is actually like possessed and that they all magically get pulled into the game and they figure out that they are avatars of the game and then they also figure out their very own special abilities and superpowers and then they go on a super big and cool adventure but there is a main antagonist of the the game that is after them and trying to kill them and stop them from putting a magical jewel inside of a giant animal shaped mountain to get them out of the game and they do end up doing that and in the end they all become friends because during the adventure that they all had they started to get to know each other a whole lot more well and have started to get along with one each other as well. HOWEVER, this movie is very underrated in my opinion and that it deserves better reviews but only in my personal opinion because I would not want to offend anyone else out there or be rude or mean because I'm just making a review so here we go. So first of all the casting call for this movie is amazing with a lot of actors that I both love and recognize and seeing both Jack black and the rock and Kevin Hart all in the same movie is just such a wonderful thing to see and i think that a lot of other people who watched this movie loved that to. Also i really do love how each of the characters has their very own special skills and superpowers that can be utilized and are mandatory for completing the adventure and that they're not just skills and abilities that they just have for fun but they're actually useful in this sense. Also the humor and comedy of this movie with both Jack black and Kevin Hart is just as good as they've ever been. Also all of the action in this movie like riding around in a helicopter while getting shot at by guns and misses and being chased and hunted down by various animals that are being controlled by a jungle super villain and having cool fight scenes along the way really does make this more of an adventure to watch but in general it's just really entertaining to watch. Also the cgi and special effects like the animals and the respawning of all the characters falling from the sky and having like really cool superhero landings on the way down and the rock doing really cool super strength fighting moves sending enemies flying into the air. Also i love the character development in this Kacie for how all of the characters become friends at the end of the adventure that they have vecause before they barley liked each other or even knew each other that well but now they are all friends now and that's a very nice way to end of this movie. In conclusion, this movie has a lot of very wonderful story elements to offer and it does it well in execution, so what would I rate this movie on a scale of 1 to 10, a solid 9 because of logic sometimes but that's about it everything else was great in my personal opinion.","7/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","sefrafer","25 December 2017","The phrase says do not judge a book by its cover and well here is not judge a movie for his trailer, the film is good and no, it is not better than the original, but if it works as a sequel and it is quite funny the director Jake Kasdan managed to make a good combination between action and comedy and although there are several jokes about male reproductive organs (apparently the fashion joke this 2017) but the interesting thing is the great chemistry that exists between the actors Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was very funny to see him perform in a different way gave a certain charisma to his character,ack Black no doubt takes the movie his humor is excellent and goes according to the situation,Kevin Hart funny situations that make you like,Karen Gillan gives touches of action and sympathy,even Nick Jonas did well his role,but if he has his bad side the movie, the rules of the game in original base sometimes they do not make sense and you take a lot of freedom with these rules, other thing is we see all the time that idea in cartoons and movies(Dungeons and Dragons and The Thirteenth Floor)out of that I think the movie works, it's fun, it's entertaining, perfect for the season, I take out a tear that reference to Alan Parrish his legacy is intact.","8/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","rolandjordaan2","14 September 2018","Like most people from my generation I was mad as hell when I heard that they were remaking the 1995 cult classic 'Jumanj', then cooled down a bit when I heard it was actually a sequel and not a remake, then got mad again when I saw the cast and then got furious when I learned that Jumanji has turned into a video game...now having actually seen it...it pains me to admit...I really loved the hell out of this movie, honestly, this was one of the most enjoyable movies I've sat through this year. It is a sequel, sure, but while paying clever homages to the original, it is completely doing its own thing with truly likable and relatable characters, some real tear-jerker moments and a few scenes that actually do get slightly intense (nothing like the intensity the original created, but while that movie was quite dark, this is a comedy, plain and simple). I truly thought I'd be the last person recommending this film, but, put your feelings for the original aside, see this as a standalone film and just go in and enjoy it, you truly will not be disappointed.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","drunken_munki","19 October 2021","They took the interesting idea from the 1995 movie, and made it better.The characters are first and foremost the main reason why this is enjoyable and why the film works as a jungle adventure. The four teens are taken out of their world and dropped into the Jungle as recreated in the form of a video game simulation. The Jumanji game box updated itself, presumably with the same magic that allows it to create a world of its own.The actors did a lot here to play as the 'game' characters as if played by the younger cast. The nesting of characters inside characters was very clever and allows some real exploration of the young characters and the predicaments of being stuck in the game.The visuals are excellent, the action is paced out well and the plot is unravelled as a simple action adventure, but with the character work between everything it is very entertaining. Also very funny, a lot of the material is delivered excellently and this had a lot of very funny moments.I can't speak to the older film, it was one I watched as a kid. Anyway, this is a clever rework of the material and I think they did an excellent job. Something that a lot of modern movies lack is 'soul', but I have to say this film has it in spades. The ending was moving.8/10 excellent escapism in the style of classic adventure such as 'Indiana Jones' but set with some interesting concepts and twists with modern technology.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","statuskuo","23 December 2017","How refreshing...a teen adventure comedy that has little to do with self-hatred and darkness. This is a throwback movie down to the epic music. This is just a plain fun movie. Despite the fact that there are missing elements from the original, this movie boosts the dusty board game concept into the video game concept (it's like the movies ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" both are good, but you just need an extra jump start).
It was then no surprise to see Jake Kasdan direct this, as there is smart set-up (their abilities and weaknesses) and payoff (not going to give it away). I am going to bet right now, he is going to direct some ""Star Wars"" movie in the future (as his dad Lawrence Kasdan, wrote arguably the best one so far).
Yes, there are lingering questions after the fact, but it makes sense now why Dwayne Johnson is the star he is. He is not above being a nerd, doing nerdy things.
Go see this movie and just have fun.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","chriskylie","14 August 2020","A silly, warm-hearted, well executed adventure film for all the family. Jumanji is fully aware of what sort of film it is and what it's audience wants and it sticks to that formula unashamedly. But that's why Jumanji is a surprising success. It's got enough old school ""Indiana Jones"" style capers to appeal to the nostalgics, whilst incorporating plenty of modern gaming references and in-jokes to entertain a new crowd. There isn't a weak link in the cast (Black and Gillan both comedic standouts) and although highly predictable Jumanji even has a credible moral core. I'd happily play it again.","1/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","RhapsodyReviews","27 December 2019","Review:
'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is an adventure-comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan. It is the third installment of the 'Jumanji' franchise, after 'Zathura: A Space Adventure' (2005) and a direct sequel to 'Jumanji' (1995), which was based on the children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg.
This is a fun, hilarious adventure family film, what more can you ask for? The chemistry between all the actors are on point, bringing a fun adventure film to life.
Set twenty-one years after Jumanji, it follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji and play as their chosen characters. Joining another player, they must beat the game to return home.
Every character in the video games world was played to perfection. Dwayne Johnson basically retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead, provides a smoldering and intense performance, riddled with good-natured hilarity as the lead in this film. Kevin Hart was great as the sidekick, I think he was involved in every funny moment in which I laughed the hardest. Karen Gillan was perfect as the badass who was played by a shy teenage girl. Finally, the master of the whole film, Jack Black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection.
The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish throughout the movie, which I liked, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.
Overall, it's a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","suspiria77","9 April 2018","I am happy to say the new Jumanji is an absolute delight from start to finish. All of the actors are excellent but Jack Black truly shines as a high school girl trapped in, well, Jack Black's body. The action and special effects are thrilling, but the movie really shines in the comedy and the chemistry between the cast.A really smart choice on the filmmaker's part was to take the time at the beginning of the movie to establish the characters of the four main teenagers, so much so that when they enter the video game you still feel like you are watching those four characters even as they have been replaced by their more famous counterparts, which is a testament to the acting of those four stars.This taking time at the beginning makes the first act a little bit light on the action, but it makes up for that once our hapless heroes arrive in the world of Jumanji. The helicopter sequence in particular is a standout, one that left my five year old quite literally on the edge of her seat.The film is also funny, very, very funny. Jack Black has had a rough stretch of bombs and has been almost forgotten in recent years, but he absolutely takes over this movie in sections, reminding us of his considerable comedic talent. This is not to take away anything from the rest of the cast, who all have great moments, the banter between Johnson and Hart is fantastic, and Gillan's dance fighting is a particularly enjoyable moment as well.While it can be said that the happy ending and the main characters never seem truly in danger throughout the film, I don't think anyone is going to see this film for realism or for an unhappy resolution so it's hard to fault it for that. If you are looking for a fast paced fun bit of entertainment for the whole family (my five year old daughter and 65 year old father in law loved it equally) you can't do much better than Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.Rating *** (out of Four)","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","GiraffeDoor","30 November 2019","Doubtlessly there are going to be killjoys who feel the first movie somehow morphs if any kind of derivative material is made from is and that this sequel has ""ruined"" a classic.Admittedly I had a few qualms about some universe mechanics but that's not really why I watch those movies.Not the poignant, emotional powerhouse of the first one, just a bit of fun with just enough character development surrounding the theme of being your best self. It's actually pretty darling how the jock, two nerds (I call them that with love) and a conventionally attractive social media addict realise by the end they have more in common with each other than they first realised.The whole thing looks stunning and the set pieces are everything you want. They combine, spectacle, humour and great suspense.I was a little thrown by the thing of different actors playing the main characters playing the characters while they are in the game but it didn't taint the picture. Jack Black made a very convincing teenage girl though they sadly milked this gag for a lot more than it was worth, especially when she tries to teach Ruby how to flirt.I have more mixed feelings about the way the whole thing is presented exactly like a video game and takes a lot of time to mock game play mechanics. I actually like that it's a videogame now. It's pretty frightening to think the game can evolve to make sure that people won't lose interest in it. I did get the impression that no one in the game is sentient but the main characters and this was a negative but I choose to try and interpret it the other way.Ultimately a good bit of fun viewing that ticks all the boxes for its genre.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","leonblackwood","3 May 2018","The Review:
I was in two minds about this remake, mainly because I really enjoyed the original but I must admit, I liked what they done with the storyline. Some of the slapstick comedy wasn't that great, and I personally think that they could have done much more with the concept but I still enjoyed the movie, and the chemistry between the various characters was amusing. The CGI was also quite impressive, and I liked the twist when they went into the game but once the shock element went out the window, it seemed to go downhill. Anyway, the movie is based on 4 characters, Spencer (Dwayne Johnson, Martha (Karen Gillan), Fridge (Kevin Hart) and Bethany (Jack Black), who have all been given detention at school. Whilst on detention in the basement of the school, they come across an old video game, which turns out to be Jumanji, so they connect it to a TV and they decide to play it. After picking there various characters, the 4 teenagers get transported into the game, and they change into the characters that they have picked. Once they work out what has happened, Nigel (Rhys Darby), explains to them that they have to retrieve the Jaguar's Eye from a corrupt archaeologist, Russell Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), which they have to return to a Jaguar statue to leave the game. Whilst on there mission, they come across another teenager, Alex (Nick Jonas), who has been stuck in the game for 20 years, so they join forces to get the priceless relic, so they can return it to it's rightful place. The various characters all bring something different to the movie, and I liked the fact that Jack Black was actually a girl. The Rock just had to be the brave one, which wasn't surprising but Kevin Hart was quite funny as the Fridge. Although I found the movie entertaining, the humour was a bit too safe for me and a lot of the scenes were pretty far fetched. With that aside, I would watch the movie again, and I can appreciate that the director tried something different with a great concept but I still think that it could have been much better. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Jake Kasdan, who also brought you Sex Tape starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel, Bad Teacher, which also starred Cameron Diaz, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, The TV Set, Orange County and Zero Effect. Judging by his previous movies, he's obviously come from a comedy background, so this project was slightly out of his comfort zone. He's also worked on various TV series, like Freaks & Geeks, Grosse Pointe, Undeclared, Cracking Up, New Girl and the Grinder, and he is due to make another Bad Teacher movie, which is in development. For a remake, this movie certainly blew up at the box office, and it's made the Rock one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood today but for it's time, the original is still better in my eyes, even though it only made $263million at the box office, with a $65million budget. Budget: $90million
Worldwide Gross: $957millionGenre: Action, Adventure, Comedy
Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, Rhys Darby, Bobby Cannavale, Nick Jones, Alex Wolff, Missi Pyle and Colin Hanks. 6/10","9/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","jimbo-53-186511","29 December 2019","When 4 teenagers are summoned to do detention, 1 of the teenagers comes across an old computer console whilst rooting around in the room. Out of curiosity, the teenagers fire it up and each pick a character to play as on the game. Unbeknownst to them, once they select their characters they end up sucked into the game and become the very avatars they've chosen. The stakes are high for the teenagers when they find that they can only be freed from the game by returning a jewel back to the Jaguar to release a curse that has been put on Jumanji.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has a very 'Breakfast Club' type opening to proceedings with the characters ending up in detention and playing similar clichéd characters to what we saw in that film over 30 years ago. However, the screenwriters have carefully crafted the characters in this manner as a mere set-up for them arriving in the game as the adult avatars that they've chosen.In effect, what this does is allows the teenagers to retain their original personalities, but in the bodies of completely different people. It perhaps doesn't sound that amusing if you look at it written down, but when you see the results on screen then you'll understand what I'm getting at. In fact, the character chemistry is really where the film is at its best; Spencer and Fridge have their roles slightly reversed in the game which sets up some fun interplay between Johnson and Hart (particularly when Fridge forgets that he is no longer bigger and tougher than Spencer). Black perhaps has the most fun camping it up as a teenage girl trapped inside a middle-aged man's body - I have to admit part of me found it a little creepy, but a lot of me found it very funny (particularly when Bethany is trying to get used to her new 'body'). Gillan doesn't quite have as much fun as the others as she is mostly forced to play it straight - although her flirting scene is good and she looks terrific in those little shorts!!!). Jonas is perhaps the slight weak link here as he never seems to quite gel with the rest of the cast. I don't rate him as much of an actor, but he was OK in this one.I've talked a lot about the characters and they are a big selling point in this film; the original film had Robin Williams and it's fair to say that he completed dominated that picture. In this film, the 4 teenagers play as computer game characters and all bring different skill-sets to the table; this automatically makes the narrative more involving as you know that each character needs the other which sets up a strong dynamic. In the original film I always felt that Williams carried the film whereas in this remake the 4 actors all bring it to life making it feel like a nice collective effort.If I was to be critical of the film then I did feel that the story was only so-so and I thought the villain was poor as were his band of goons.In summary then this was a fun adventure which mostly works due to the strong chemistry and camaraderie between the 4 leads. Having them play as computer game characters rather than just been sucked into the game as themselves adds another dimension to the film and makes them interesting. If you're in one of those 'switch off brain and enjoy moods' then just sit back and relax as there's a lot of joy to be found in this film.","8/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","bodhi-13262","30 December 2017","The infamous board-game as we know it has evolved, and this time it has taken the form a new system with new players. Having hit the reset button, does the 'Jumanji' from the 90s adapt as well as it does in the present day?1. Picking up where we left off from the original 1995 film with the board-game buried under the sand on a beach, it is discovered once again. Neglected by its finder, the game transfers into that of an obsolete video-game system which is jump-started by four students serving detention at a local high-school. From that point, they all are sucked into the world of Jumanji and embody their respective avatars they choose to serve as in the game. Keeping this spoiler free, the premise within the game itself is nothing special or original in the least. The players are tasked with finding a certain sacred object of which they must journey and deliver to at a certain sacred place in order to return to the real-world. They all have their respective strengths, weaknesses and abilities which they must use and work together while on their journey. The plot may be simple, but it serves its purpose well enough.2. This movie should be the blueprint for future comedies to show that raunchy, vulgar and excessive sexual humor isn't always necessary in making a film funny and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the same as I did with the original as a kid growing up. Though the presence of the late Robin Williams will surely be missed, I think he'd be proud of this film. Williams was a comedic genius during his time, but the humor delivered by both Jack Black (Prof. Osbern) and Kevin Hart ('Mouse' Finbar) will have your stomach in knots. Black in particular steals the show more so than Kevin Hart, seeing as his charter is embodied by the self-centered teenage girl Bethany (Madison Iseman). Black's acting and portrayal of his real-life counter-part was nothing short of outstanding. His gestures and voice in particular sold me on him being a girl trapped in a man's body. Don't get me wrong, Kevin Hart has his laugh-out-loud moments as well.3. The action was surprisingly good for a family film. I'm not sure how well younger audiences will fare watching this as there are some frightening sequences as well as brief sexual references and innuendos throughout. Unlike the first, this sequel is PG-13 as it takes certain and surprising liberties I wasn't expecting it to. Whenever there's action....call Dwayne Johnson, who literally delivers a knock-out punch with his performance as the daring Dr. Bravestone. I must say, I enjoyed Johnson's comedic chops in this more than any other film I've seen him in thus far. Never having been a fan of the Jonas Brothers back in the day, Nick Jonas (Alex) actaully surprised me as to how good of an actor he is. I used to cringe at his acting during his Disney channel run, but I'm glad to see he's finally bettered himself. I suppose there's no point in hiding my undying love for Karen Gillan. She's beautiful, deadly, funny and a joy to watch on screen.4. My only complaint and first major flaw of this film is the villain. Bobby Cannavale has proven himself as a good actor, but here he falters as the treacherous hunter/explorer Van Pelt. This movie would have been close to perfect had they not failed to include a worthy antagonist. Van Pelt could have been played by any actor to be honest. The character himself is weak and his goal is like any other cliche in which he wants the thing which the heroes have so he hunts them down to get back the thing that will give him power instead of the other thing happening. Apart from that, the cinematography and editing was phenomenal in this. The breathtaking scenery and shots of the various Hawaiian isles blew me away. Though not as cinematic in scope as 'Kong: Skull Island', it still urges me to want to visit Hawaii. If there was one other minor thing the film was weak in was the score. I felt Henry Jackman could have composed music more exciting.With his last film being the atrocious 'Sex Tape', Jake Kasdan has redeemed himself and proven to also be a good action director. If you're hoping this film to be a tribute to Robin Williams in some way, it really isn't, although it mentions subtle ties to the first. 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is by far one of the best comedies this year and is certainly on my top 10 list of best movies of 2017.","8/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","funnycommentor","18 July 2023","I have to admit, when I first watched ""Jumanji"" (1995) I really enjoyed that movie and I was so hyped about the sequel! Eventually, the sequel was as good as the original movie and I definitely enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and kinda similar to the previous movie. The storyline was very well written, kinda different than the original movie and everything was well-explained, however it was kinda simple and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, kinda well-developed and really likeable. In my opinion, that movie had a better filming location (jungle, Hawaii) instead of the previous movie's filming location. The casting was really GOOD and their acting was perfect, everyone portrayed their character amazingly well. Also, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and full of epic chase/fight scenes. The opening scene was kinda unpredictable and it was definitely promising. The ending scene was kinda unexpected and it was definitely really good. Moreover, the cinematography and the CGI effects of the movie were INCREDIBLE. Overall, it was an enjoyable sequel, very funny, adventurous and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","mohdaqif","2 April 2018","I was watched this movie 3 months ago on East Coast Mall and it was wonderful movie. This is the best The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) movie i ever seen since The Rundown (2003). Kevin Hart's also great too. Jack Black was good, Karen Gillan was great too. This movie is the sequel of 1995 of the same film staring Robin Williams, who died in 2014, causing suicide by hanging. I also like Robin Williams since Patch Adams and RV (2006). I haven't seen Mrs. Doubtfire yet, but I will watch it very soon. I also watch the original film, it was the great movie.I wonder don't why people hate this movie because this is not Jumanji. Well, I like this film, it was a funny movie. Just for it, my cousin's sister paid us RM 17 for movie tickets. I laugh this part because Kevin hart ate the cake, causing the explode.This is my favorite film 2017 since Baby Driver, Abang Long Fadil 2, John Wick Chapter 2, Spider-Man Homecoming and Wonder Woman.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","TxMike","30 March 2018","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library.The 1995 Jumanji had a quite different story, and at the end the last scene shows the Jumanji game box in the sand, on a beach, for another unsuspecting person to find it.The current version shows that scene and some 20 years after the first it is updated to reflect modern times. Four high school students are in after-school detention, for four unrelated reasons. One of them finds an old electronic game box, they manage to hook it up to an old TV, then proceed to each select a Jumanji game character. Upon completion each is sucked into the fictional reality of the Jumanji world where they have to elude beasts and other dangers, and find a way to correct a wrongdoing to save Jumanji.Just fun entertainment, the most enjoyment is from each character. For example a meek geek boy becomes a muscular fighter (The Rock) while a large football player called The Fridge becomes a short weekling (Kevin Hart). One of the girls becomes a man (Jack Black) and marvels at the extra body part she now has.Well made and fun entertainment. Much of it shot in beautiful Hawaii.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8 November 2019","The original Jumanji (1995) back in the mid 1990s was a phenomenon in itself. It may have not smashed records like that of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) or Jurassic Park (1993), but it was also no underground film that went totally under the radar. Many fans remember it fondly for not only having likable characters and an interesting story, but also because of the lasting impression it left. While Jumanji was marketed as a family film, it definitely had some rather intense moments. When a sequel was announced to this film, somehow the reaction wasn't as largely lambasted. Probably majority of people were curious as to how such a feat could be pulled off. To everyone's surprise, things went better than expected, especially with respect to other game to movie adaptations.Directed by Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher (2011) and Sex Tape (2014)) and writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers (The Lego Batman Movie (2017)), Scott Rosenberg (Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)) and Jeff Pinkner (The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)) all penning the script put together a sequel that remarkably matches up the original. Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman) and Martha (Morgan Turner) are all everyday high school students. Spencer's a nerd, Fridge is an athlete, Bethany is the popular girl and Martha is not. After they all receive detention for disobeying their teachers, they discover the Jumanji game in the form of a video game in the room they sit. It is there they discover there's more to the game than just something to use their time. Once inside the game, is when things get uniquely comical.Spencer becomes the macho Dr. ""Smolder"" Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Fridge turns into Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) and Bethany, to her shock is now Professor Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (Jack Black). And what makes the plot to this sequel a worthy follow-up is because of how it changes the scenario for everyone involved. Unlike the original where the game turned its surrounding environment into the jungle, here the people playing the game get transported into the game (which is a jungle). On top of that, the four main stars are also not turning in performances they usually fit the mold too. Johnson, Black, Gillan and Hart all have to play the younger actors' personalities and not their own. While some mannerisms are kept the same, seeing the veteran actors act like teenagers is very different.This leads to some very comedic scenes revolving around their situation. It's all opposites as to how they looked in real life. However aside from the physical aspect, the characters also have other moments to develop and learn to work as a team. There's also appearances from Nick Jonas and Bobby Cannavale who plays Van Pelt (the villain from the original movie). Most of the time replacing an already existing character would constitute as bad continuity, but here there's a justifiable reason as to why Van Pelt is being played by another actor, so it's okay. However one thing that does need to be addressed, is more use of the lesser known stars. Yes, having Jack Black, Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan and Kevin Hart star does help, but it would be nice to see more attention given to the younger actors. There's also the whole thing about how the story continues after this....it is rather definitive.As for visuals, the cinematography was handled by Gyula Pados. For what's shown, it looks great. The backgrounds are lush green and the inside scope of Jumanji looks vast and wide. Pados seems to know how to handle this based on the fact that he also shot for other big landscape films like Predators (2010) and Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015). Lastly, the film score composed by Henry Jackman was well done too. Jackman has lent his talents to all genres like Monsters Vs. Aliens (2009), Kick-Ass (2010) and Winnie the Pooh (2011), so it shows that he can handle not only more tender moments but also lively action sequences too. While he doesn't reprise the creepy theme of James Horner's score, he does create a new one that fits the tone and it is repeated throughout.While the younger actors don't get as much time to shine, nor does this sequel really leave it open to more stories, this sequel is definitely on point with its predecessor. The action/comedy mix well, the scenario has the main leads challenge their performance skills, the cinematography is lit fantastically and the music is a welcome addition to franchise.","8/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Geoff1963","30 December 2017","Lots of action, a few life lessons, and plenty of humour. The young characters, dealing with ( in one case, EXTREMELY ) different adult bodies, was very well done.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Abdulxoxo","13 February 2021","This movie reverses the whole concept of the original, instead of stuff coming out of the game, this time stuff goes into the game. We then find ourselves in Jumanji with the four teenagers who have now turned into their avatars. After getting over the initial shock of the situation, they realise that each of their characters have unique strengths and weaknesses and they must work together and use their abilities to complete the game in order to go home. The actual plot wasn't as terrible and sort of worked as a loose sequel to the original. The scenario plays out like a computer game which which was pretty cool and mostly well done. Like a computer game each character gets a certain number of lives. There were also details like non-player characters repeating certain phrases because they only have very specific roles to play in the game. I thought that side of the film was well written. However it's the performances that make this movie so good. In particular Jack Black, who almost steals the whole film. His impressions of a teenage girl in a middle-aged man's body were hilarious. We know he's a funny physical actor and he takes full advantage in this film to have fun with the scenario. Dwayne Johnson is also really good. His characters real life persona of Spencer is a geek who's afraid of everything. Yet that kid is now in Johnson's body with the strength and charisma of Bravestone, who literally smoulders. Kevin Hart is also hilarious. Karen Gillan doesn't exactly play against type, but she does become a badass character who is also very funny especially when trying to flirt.
On the whole, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is packed full of both terrific action and comedy, and superb performances.","9/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","view_and_review","24 December 2017","22 years after Jumanji debuted it has been redone (well, it can be considered a sequel). Normally, I'm so apprehensive about remakes and sequels because they're simply never as good as the original. But this time I was extremely hopeful because the trailers were so good. In fact, the trailers were too good. The various trailers gave away the first quarter of the movie. There wasn't a punchline in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie except that I'd already seen it. That still left 75% or more of the movie to be viewed untainted but it did suck to be watching reruns at the start. I guess that's the catch 22. Because the trailers were so good I committed to watch it, yet those same trailers stole some of my enjoyment.Still, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a clever remake. Instead of a board game it's now a video game and instead of all of the events occurring within your surroundings the player is drawn into the game. The movie provided plenty of laughs courtesy of Kevin Hart followed by Jack Black. As a story it made sense and flowed well. I still think the original is better but this was a good tribute.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Howlin Wolf","27 May 2018","Tremendous fun.Who would have thought that I'd find Kevin Hart to be the most amusing, of the troupe?!I see Jack Black getting all the praise, and whilst he is hilarious, taking on the mind of a teenage girl is an immediately funny conceit; Kevin Hart really sells the lines and makes them funnier then they might be with somebody else's reading, so I'm going to give him some credit, too.Dwayne Johnson also demonstrates once again how effective he is, when it comes to playing brawny guys who conceal a sensitive side.I feel like this is a genuine, crowdpleasing entertainment, of the kind that Hollywood has been unable to deliver properly, in some years (somewhere around 1996, as it happens... What are the odds? :-) )","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","jetkot","26 December 2017","All Jumanji fans will agree that this movie is a perfect tribute to the original. I was not expecting a good film as most sequels lose the plot and just cash in on the success of the first film. This one was excellent. Dwayne Johnson has definitely come a long way. He looks fantastic and acts really well. Karen Gillan looks seductively hot and acts really well. Her role is brilliant. Kevin Hart and Jack Black give out a genuinely heart warming performance and you leave smiling . They make you laugh plenty of times. Excellent film","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","martin-807-452270","3 January 2018","So...Jumanji - Welcome to the jungle.***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***I totally loved the original Jumanji, can't believe it's over 20 years old! I remember watching the herd of rhino crashing through the town centre and being incredibly impressed with the CGI and all that nonsense, and it was actually touching how Robin Williams' family had suffered after his disappearance. Was a great film and I re-watched it recently in preparation for this sequel and it is still an excellent film.I really liked this new movie - it's very well made, quite funny and superbly paced. Loved it. If (like me) you've ever played D&D then this is about as close as you'll ever get I suppose. Anyone who has played a Computer game or RPG should love it and let's face it that's quite a big market.Karen Gillen is particularly good, after such small roles in Guardians of the Galaxy she deserved a more prominent role. Jack Black is excellent and the Dwayne The Rock is, um just the Rock with more asides than usual.Some awesome CGI and imaginative camera work really made this film for me. It did deserve a slightly better polish on the script and some of the plot points could have done with a nudge, but on the whole I thought it was great. I'd watch it again.But now I need a third part when we discover who made the game and why... Or maybe I don't need a prequel at all and sometimes things can just be because that's how things are.4.5/5 Excellent fun.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","DKosty123","27 December 2017","With Jack Black and Kevin Hart, comedy is to be expected here. This adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's book is that and a whole lot more. The action carries the film at a steady pace. It is a satisfying adventure from start to finish. Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan (Guardians Of The Galaxy) create a strong top 4 with excellent support. Do not compare this with the 1995 film, sequel it is not.Overall, this film carries itself well. Enjoy the ride this movie offers. It starts with the finding of the game, everyone getting sucked into the contest, and then the playing of the game in order to get everyone to win the game and escape. It is an amazing game, so well scripted that the audience enjoys it instead of looking for more than it is. The film at 1 minute under 2 hours is just about perfect.There's lots action and plenty of plot to keep everyone aware of what they are aiming for. I never saw the 1st film and after seeing this one, I see no reason to as this one holds it's own with any film. Adventure is the key to success here and the script and cast bring it allin.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","fletcherc21","21 December 2017","This sequel essentially only brings the name and concept of getting trapped in a game from the original. It is essentially an action heavy version of The Breakfast Club, as four high schoolers from different social groups are all in detention together and get sucked into the game. Along the way they grow and develop and move past their differences and realize they need to work together to get out of the game. The core of the movie is simple body swap comedy, which they all do well, but Jack Black excels in particular as a shallow self obsessed teenage girl trapped in Jack Black's body. The plot is essentially a video game, reminiscent of Tomb Raider or Uncharted, but used as a vehicle for humorous moments. The humor plays to all ages with jokes targeted at kids and jokes for adults. The adult jokes were mostly about flirting and social interactions with very few of them being sexual. There was only one joke that the 7 year old next to me felt the need to ask his mom about, but it was subtle enough that she could just move past it. There was also not a single fart or poop joke, which is a miracle in a modern comedy.This sequel is one of the few that actually surpasses the original, which was scarier for kids and not as funny for everyone else. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is the action comedy that leans on the comedy and is actually funny without being crude.","7/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","expertocrede","15 November 2020","I think I have watched a simple and cheap teenager movie which is from 2005. The story is so strong for a nice film but I am afraid they could not use correctly. Although visual effects are not outstanding if you want to choice like fantastic movie. Seems like producer did not want to spend money for this movie I sense an intense lack of quality and cheapness. Character introduction is pretty crucial in movies like this because we watch a loser men-women and apparently they improve themselves with time but I didn't take proper information before the action especially for girl. And then suddenly plot point 1 was over, they included the game. After that time during 20 minutes we watch the sexy girl joke. The story is never going on in that times. After the first scenes of motorbiker guys we watch billions of scenes which are trying to make epic. Al the time with increasing music sound, somebody explore himself and decide to become self-confident person, 5 minutes later again I watch the same thing . At least 4-5 scenes are like this. I have never watched a regularly rising of character story. Because of this reason I don't feel any signal of victory before the resolution part of script.Frankly, I like the game-inside point only. Rest of the movie don't satisfy me, if you want to spend time with your children you can choose it otherwise no need for watching.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","HorrorDisasterGuy-90617","18 December 2023","I enjoyed watching this movie and is creative. The story is unique with four teenagers get sucked into the video game and turn into the video game characters. I really like the four actors performance with the amount of humor they give out and how they act like the teenagers who they supposed to be. The movie is both great being a comedy and action with how it was executed. The comedy is funny with the actors and the video game logic it presented here. It contains a lot of funny moments and line from the characters of the movie and is entertaining to watch. The action is both enjoyable and suspenseful with the amount of action it presented here. Also, it contains a lot of great special effects and CGI in it. As for the characters, they are developed really well and have strong relationship to each of them.One flaw I have is one part of the ending that I still question about.","4/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","ericstevenson","29 December 2017","At first I thought this would be remake or reboot of the original ""Jumanji"" film, but instead it's definitely a sequel. It is sad to see none of the original actors or characters from the film but then again, that was over 20 years ago, so we can't really blame them. I still miss Robin Williams. I like the idea of updating the story into a video game and there are tons of amusing moments in this movie. The characters are really quite likeable especially Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black. The special effects could probably be better, but they're still nice.This movie really does have a lot of heart to it and I found myself rooting for the characters at the end. The ending is quite heartwarming and it feels well deserved for everybody. I admit I don't like the idea of all the creatures being inside the game and not coming out. We still get a lot of great jokes and playful jabs at video games in general. I was annoyed at how none of the creatures from the original film appeared in this. I mean, it is the same Jumanji as the original, right? ***","9/10"

Rant over, when I heard they were making this film I was worried as the original with Robin Williams and a young Kirsten Dunst was so good. I needn't have worried as this is even better. A brilliant cast of Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are so likeable they totally make this film so brilliant.They get materialised into a computer game during detention and have to save Jumanji form the nasty Van Pelt.It's such a fun film with dare I say it a touch of melacholy which all great films should have.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","FlashCallahan","16 January 2018","Four high school kids discover an old video game console and are drawn into the game's jungle setting, literally becoming the adult avatars they chose. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji...........you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, and change the way they think about themselves - or they'll be stuck in the game forever.........Having never been a fan of the first film, I wasn't so keen on seeing this, but due to them having some brilliant chemistry on screen and off, Johnson and Hart sold the film for me, especially with the fact that the former has to play against type as a nerdy guy trapped in the mans body.Lest to say, the overall outcome is a tepid sequel that owes more to Raiders Of The Lost Ark than the original movie.The main problem is that although the cast do well in depicting their teenage counterparts, those teenagers are rather unlikable, even though they all have life lessons taught to them throughout the film.Hart is wasted in this, he feels really restrained in this, and whereas he bounced of Johnson in Central Intelligence, the chemistry here is non existant, and could have been a crucial part to the films narrative.Gillan is good, but she's nothing more than a Lara Croft wannabe who is good at dance fighting, even though the choice of song is terrible.And then there is Black, I've never been a fan of the man, he became too self aware after School Of Rock, but he redeemed himself with Bernie slightly. Here, it's back to basics with him, chewing scenery with every breath he takes, sucking the life out of everything he's doing. And the humour regarding his character is a little too smutty for my liking and really feels out of place in the film.Action wise, it's adequate enough, there are a coup,e of good set pieces that pass the time, but all in all, it felt all a bit 'is that it?' Once the film reached its climax.Add a villain that could have easily been avoided, and you have a damp squib of a film that really disappoints.","8/10"

I enjoyed this movie very much, just as amazing as the original movie.Jack Black and Kevin Hart, two amazing actors, each time making me laugh again.

Jack Black playing a girl in his body - hilarious, especially going to the loo! Kevin Hart as the slow, shouldn't eat cake valet, playing the height card didn't get old. And Karen Gillan trying to flirt looked like me when I tried!And I totally forgot about the metal head in the beginning so that was a good wrap up. Nick Jonas was another good actor. And Colin Hanks at the end? I cried when he said ""we named her after the girl that saved my life"".

Whereas the original used the actual home of the players to stage the gameplay run amok, this version shoots the action in Hawaii, I believe, for God knows what reason & still have critters of the CG kind terrorize our players as if that makes any kind of difference. The sequel has already been scheduled for release next year but if I do happen to revisit this franchise, I'll watch it at home.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","tadpole-596-918256","3 January 2018",". . . there was first a children's book called JUMANJI, and then a family film titled the same. I do not believe that Japan's Sony Pictures was involved with either project. I vaguely recall the book was about a wholesome American board game, and the scariest thing about the original Made-in-the-USA flick involved kids on flying carpets in some sort of meteor shower. Before being subverted by Japanese propagandists, JUMANJI was not a wall-to-wall product placement vehicle for Asian motorcycles. It should go without saying that the original genuine American JUMANJI book and movie did NOT involve high school gals suddenly sprouting lizards, and then needing ten-minute lessons from the born-as-boys crowd on how to drain them. This insidious Sony Trojan Horse retains just enough of the trappings from the beloved U.S. original to sucker citizens into squandering their resources at theaters in our own Homeland in order to pervert our precious kiddies by filling their minds with smut and filth.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Pjtaylor-96-138044","27 December 2017","'Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle (2017)' relies almost solely on its central body-swapping conceit, which elevates it above several other action-comedies with a similarly broad 'save the day' story. The fantastic, against-type acting really is great fun. The four major stars easily pass as simple avatars for the 'real', more-or-less teenage cast who actually get sucked into the titular game. You actually forget that you're watching Dwayne Johnson instead of Alex Wolff. The film isn't hilarious but it's funny enough, humorously milking its video-game setting and unexpected characters for all they're worth. When it gets going, it's very enjoyable. It isn't exactly deep, but - if you're willing to go with it - it's entertaining, crowd-pleasing fluff. Plus, it actually does a decent job with character development. The action is exciting, the comedy is chuckle-worthy and the acting is surprisingly good. 7/10Note: This is a heavily edited version of a previously written review.","6/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","jamesba-640-753446","7 May 2018","I went in this film with the lowest expectations and the film managed to surprise me. It deserves and 8/10 for it's fun but is definitely a 6/10 film.It was a fun adventure film and I can't help but think that this would be reviewed favorably if it did not have the Jumanji name attached. This is a fact that does annoys me, and impacted my expectations.The first act of the film is dull, a clear rip off of the Breakfast Club, and gives the convoluted reason why this is a Jumanji film. Unfortunately, the first characters introduced are one dimensional and unlikable , you can see their arc from miles away. The film picks up quickly once our ""heroes"" finally gets to Jumanji and is the turning point. In testament to the setup, the characters do retain their traits throughout the movie, which was a shock considering the caliber of actors in the film, sorry Dwayne.This film succeeds due to it's comedy, which is on point for the most part and is driven by Jack Black. It was also helped by the fact that Kevin Hart is subdued, a wise decision as he is typically insufferable. Jack Black is finally back to his best, as he has been poor for many years and is the stand out part of the movie.The plot of the film is ludicrous and full holes, merely there to support the comedy but you don't mind as the comedy is spot-on. The action is acceptable and keeps the viewer engaged for the most part.This film is not a work of genius and doesn't pretend to be and is partly the reason it works. It doesn't have interesting visuals, a complex plot, terribly great acting but it is excellent fun and I would recommend to anyone looking to fill 2 hours.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","melkennedy-05060","28 February 2018","Gosh its been a long time since they've made something decent and fun (and funny) for the whole family. Was so worried this would be cliche or stupid but I found myself crying with laughter.Yes some of it is predictable, but some of it is original and funny and that should be enough. Never though I would say that Jack Black takes the lead over my man Dwayne Johnson but god hes funny. He plays a teenage girl brilliantly, in fact best ""body swap"" acting I've ever seen. Loved this, will watch again and again","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Quinoa1984","23 December 2017","Heres one you can chalk up to low expectations, but a movie with the unfortunate title of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (and look I get it, people still remember the song and it plays with a trailer, but it doesn't play as far as anything remotely clever) is an enjoyable experience. This all comes down to who is involved and, for the most part, how the director uses his cast and resources.Jake Kasdan is not especially known for big Hollywood spectacle on a 100 mil budget (whatever it is if it has Dwayne Johnson and it's *under* 100 mil that's an achievement), but he is known for, to varying degrees of success, his work in comedies like Orange County and the underrated Walk Hard. Kasdan isnt a Joe Johnston, who directed the first moderately successful/hey-its-not-some-nostalgic-classic-its-alright original, so he only has a competent sense of action and effects (theyre not *bad* theyre just competent and adequate and thats fine). What he does have in spades is the ability to get good work out of actors ready to stretch themselves just a little, and thats what you get here with an additional treat: video game meta(ish)ness.In other words, if you pay attention to movies currently and have seen what The Rock and Kevin Hart and (to a smaller extent) Jack Black have done in movies, this subverts that since the concept opens it up; the pitch is almost like, I dunno, Breakfast Club meets Tron but, of course, in a jungle, as four teens (dorks, jock, popular girl, et al) get stuck in a video game during detention and take on avatars of Johnson, Hart, the lovely Karen Gillan and Black and have to take on a mission all aren't quite ready for. Though this does leave us with seeing arcs play out with the original teen actors bookending the movie, they're solid arcs for what is at heart a kids comedy, and it's a comedy that banks on us knowing at least some (if not a lot more) of how we see these actors, for the most part, and what happens when Johnson has to play afraid of everything and Hart is a football star who has his stated video game character ""weakness"" as ""Speed"". Woops.Thats the other thing, on the whole, this movie understands video games likely more than 99% of other video game movies (if one wants to count Scott Pilgrim vs the World as one, and I would up to a point, thats the only one that really digs deep into understanding and satitirizing video games, at least until Ready Player One comes out, that I can think of). When we get a flashback, for example, of Bobby Cannavale's sneering weird-iris-eyed villain's origin a character explains to another that this is what's called a ""cut scene."" There are also life bars on the characters' arms and the uncertainty about what will happen if all the bars are gone and if that means actual death, not just dead-and-come-back, is not a plot hole so much as it works as genuine ambiguity for what these people are in to and for us. And, again, every major actor here is up to so the double work of playing these teen types and what their video game avatars are supposed to do (ie Black's Bethany is a cartographer, to which she states at one point shes a map ""doctor"", so to speak I guess).This is a genuinely clever, funny script that shows Kasdan's skill at mining for comedy based on everything the premise can give him. And it provides a lot for everyone in the cast (save maybe Cannave, who is better than this but whatever he's screen presency) to dig in to, and the arcs for them while a bit obvious are worthwhile and the message of looking past the types into what makes you stronger or more confident or just not, well, a dick to people or others (ie Bethanys self-centeredness or Fridge's stand-offish 'i dont need to study' aspect), works. This doesnt mean everything is as funny as it should be, which is why I said ""for the most part"" before; Jack Black is given one note to play as ""ugh""-y teen narcissist and it gets a bit tiring when there isn't something completely genius for him to say (which is often). It's to the point where, and I never thought I'd say this, Hart gets more or just stronger comedic material than Black does, or knows how to use how we see him to an advantage or whathaveyou. There's also a fifth character midway through that provides some story intrigue and more stakes (it also is a good move via set up and pay off from the opening of the film which may/may not be following up off the original, dont know doesnt matter) and he is serviceable as an actor but doesn't stand out like everyone elae does.This might just be grading on a curve since its far from anything great and isn't without some logical jumps to make - yes, I say this, for a Jumanj maybe standalone rebooquel - such as a thing that happens with a life exchange that just happens and is never properly explained (I'm not sure without spoiling it I can recall seeing a multi-player game where that was a thing, though I must admit I haven't been avid as a gamer in a while), and again the action and actual spectacle is only impressive inasmuch as what's there as Kasdan as competence but not an original or striking vision (perhaps the one perk to Johnston over the next gen director, albeit time and money have changed the quality of effects). But if you are curious in the slightest and the trailer didn't turn you off and like Johnson and Gillan and most of the folks involved in making this, you may be surprised to see people who give a damn about what they're doing and the lines they say and how their characters develop within the limitations of a children's fantasy adventure. It's the B side once you're done this season with Star Wars's A-side record.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Cinemaniac1984","4 January 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was an amazingly fun movie from start to finish. I honestly thought that it wasn't going to hold a candle to the 1995 classic with Robin Williams and that it was going to crash and burn at the box office. How wrong I was. I had a great time, and there were plenty of laughs. This movie fits perfectly into the modern day era with a lot of updated aspects of the story as well as a completely new cast.The movie starts off with in 1996, when teenager Alex (Mason Guccione) is given the Jumanji board game after his father discovers it on a beach following the events of the previous movie where it was dropped into a river. Alex is originally uninterested with the game however once he finds that it has transformed into a video game cartridge, he starts to play it. Alex then disappears and is never seen again. Fast forward to 2017 where teenagers Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman), and Martha (Morgan Turner) are unceremoniously given detention and their principal orders them to clean out a storage area at the school as punishment. Upon discovering the same video game cartridge, the four teenagers start to play the game and find themselves sucked into the world of Jumanji. To their horror, the teenagers find themselves as the four characters they picked to play the game. Spencer is the muscular explorer Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Fridge is the short zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Martha is the lethal commando Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Bethany is the overweight cartographer Dr. Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). The four characters are polar opposites to the teenagers. Spencer is a weak willed nerd who is academically clever, Fridge is the tall football jock who shows no interest in school, Bethany is beautiful but very self centered, and Martha is socially awkward. As their four respective characters, they learn from their guide Nigel (Rhys Darby) that to survive the world of Jumanji they must band together to complete the game. They also have to battle the possessed evil explorer Russel Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale).You couldn't have picked a diverse cast with Dwayne Johnson (San Andreas), Jack Black (Tropic Thunder), Kevin Hart (Ride Along) and Karen Gillan (Guardians of the Galaxy). All four are awesome in their respective roles and fit into the movie perfectly. Rhys Darby (Flight of the Concords) does a good job in his small role as the guide Nigel. I still think of Jonathan Hyde's Van Pelt from the original Jumanji movie however Bobby Cannavale (Boardwalk Empire) takes up a different version of Van Pelt in this movie and runs with it.As I said at the start, I didn't have much faith in this movie after being indifferent to Jumanji being resurrected. I didn't think much of the original trailer either. After rewatching the original movie which I have loved since I was 12 years old, I came across the trailer to the new movie and decided to give it a second go. I was completely wrong in thinking that this was going to be a box office failure. I was in absolute surprise to see how fun this movie was going to be. And it was absolutely fun from start to finish.If you liked the original Jumanji, you will not be disappointed. If you haven't seen the original Jumanji, still watch it. If you seek adventure, I guarantee you will have an amazing time. Sit back and have a blast.8/10.","9/10"

Jack Black is hilarious, and there's even some references to the late Robin Williams. Great work!","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","jellopuke","11 February 2018","There's a couple of jokes that might be too much, but for the most part this was a fun kids movie with lots of action and comedy and excitement. It's not exactly high art, but Jack Black was pretty funny as the teen girl stuck in a fat man's body and The Rock did a good job playing the nervous nerd with the mega physique. The villain was pointless and a huge waste of Bobby C. but there was a nice touch about having confidence in yourself that worked as minor pathos. Better than I was expecting.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Sophie_89","1 January 2019","When i first started watching this I thought I can't sit through two hours of these incredibily annoying teenagers, but then they changed into other characters when they got sucked into the game. I loved how they were all polar opposites of themselves in real life - the nerdy girl became a hot, high-kicking warrior, the nerdy guy became The Rock, the massive football player became the weedy side-kick and, in my opinion, the funniest of them all, the self-obsessed beauty queen became Jack Black! My jaw hurt from laughing so much at Jack Black playing a selfie-obsessed teenage girl! The adult actors were believeable in their portrayals of both their teenage characters and their characters in the Jumanji game. I'm always sceptical of these remakes of classic films but this one did not disappoint, thank you for not ruining the original!","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","cruise01","23 December 2017","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun comedy action film that has a great ensemble like Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan. And a whole lot of action to keep you entertained. Now does it succeed over the original film that has the beloved Robin Williams? No, I still loved the original film and also because the idea of a board game bringing real threats to the world from big spiders, a herd of elephants breaking through a house, and a flash storm in the living room. I thought this film was still good and fun. And it is a sequel to the original. But once you hear the jumanji drum rolls it sure does bring back memories from the original. The film starts with a teenager finding a board game on the beach in 1996. However, like he said, who plays board games and sets it aside as he continues to play video games. Overnight, the teen disappears and all is left is a jumanji video game. Now, 20 or so years later, Spencer (Alex Wolff), Bethany (Madison Iseman), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), and Martha (Morgan Turner) are all on detention in high school and are suppose to clean up the basement. Til they discover a Jumanji video game. They play and get thrown into the world of Jumanji as avatars like Dr. Smolder (Dwayne Johnson), Shelly (Jack Black), Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Mouse (Kevin Hart). They have to play the game and search for the missing eye of Jumanji to break the curse.The film is a lot of fun and it has some fun humor. Alex Wolff playing the nerdy teen. Madison Iseman playing a self centered popular teen, which she is obsessed with taking selfies and posting it. Ser'Darius Blain a jocky student. And Morgan Turner plays the awkward teen, who is sheltered from everyone. Then, the avatar versions of these characters like Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Kevin Hart were all fun and great. There is some exciting fun action as these characters travel the world of Jumanji. Being chased by the villain Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) biker goons as they are on the search for the eye. With a beastly Johnson punching guys through walls, and Karen Gillan dance fighting skills. They make a great combo. Black is more of a navigator with map reading skills and Hart is a weapon specialist. It is interesting to see how the world of Jumanji is. But at the same time, I miss the original idea of a board game coming to life. This film has action, bad guys chasing the good on motorcycles. The good guys walking through each stage of the game from death trap hallways, a stampede of rhinos and a helicopter chase, and being chased by Jaguars. If this film were a stand alone, it would have been better with no comparison. There is also some fun humor with these characters. Penis jokes on one male character that a girl is playing as. And seeing Jack Black teaching Karen Gillan how to flirt was hilarious. There is plenty of more with these characters. Overall, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a good action adventure film. It is a fun addition to the original. The cast was great. It has plenty of action and humor to keep you entertained. The plot was also good seeing the world of Jumanji and modernizing the game as a video game. But nowhere as great as the original.I rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend seeing the film in theatres it is fun for the whole family if you seen the original or not.","1/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","niallmaggs","5 January 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a (apparent) sequel to the 1995 classic Jumanji starring Robin Williams, surrounding a mysterious board game. The 2017 film has the same premise, except this time it's not a board game, but a video game from the 90's.Four students at a school receive detentions for different reasons, and end up together having to staple booklets. Spencer (Alex Wolf) discovers an old video game called 'Jumanji', the students set up the game and play it, but end up being sucked in, turning them into the form of the characters they chose. Spencer's character takes the form of Dwayne Johnson. The other characters actors' consist of Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black. From here onwards, there is non stop fun, action, great humour, and a glorious soundtrack!The premise here really works well. The plot takes unexpected twists and turns that keeps the audience on their toes. But what makes it thrive, is the great chemistry between the actors, in particular Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart; this type of chemistry can't be scripted. The one liners exchanged between both are hilarious and they work really well together. We'll definitely be seeing these two together in more movies in the future. It's not just these two that have great chemistry, Karen Gillan and Jack Black also really fit in with Johnson and Hart. All of them each have their own style and bring something different to the crew, Whether it's Johnson's charisma, Hart's comedy or Gillan's striking looks, there is something for everybody to enjoy in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.And trust me, Karen Gillan isn't just there for her beauty, she's hilarious and a vital asset to the rest of the team. All of her scenes are memorable, whether she's dancing to Big Mountain's Baby, I Love Your Way while beating soldiers up, or taking flirting advice from Jack Black, she's constantly the star among the popular likes of Dwayne Johnson, which demonstrates her strength as an actor if she can outdo The Rock! Her performance is brilliant, and the video game character is a complete opposite to the real life Martha, played by Morgan Turner. In real life she's shy, anxious and unpopular. However in the game she's a complete badass! The way the filmmakers handled each character is really great. The tough Spencer is a nerdy guy in real life. Completely different to Fridge (Kevin Hart) who is a strong, tough, popular football player, but in the game, he's quite cowardly, small and weak. This aspect I really liked.Henry Jackman's score is used really effectively. Every scene benefited with the heart pounding music. In particular, there is a lot of sequences where the tension and suspense is just incredible. The score also resembles the whole jungle premise, making the scenes feel real and not just seem like a movie set. The sound still stayed a reasonable volume and you can still hear the dialogue. In a lot of films, the booming sound is unpleasant, but in Jumanji the music is a great addition to the already-intense scenes.The action was almost non stop. You're on the edge of your seat constantly and there is a great supply of thrills. The action direction was also very good. The lack of shaky-cam worked well, and even when it was used, the scene wasn't ever jarring or jerking. The sequences stayed enjoyable and you CAN actually see what's going on. These types of scenes were also shot brilliantly and the cinematography was simple but effective.There were some instances where a couple of scenes went on for too long however, and the runtime could've been shortened by about fifteen minutes. The pace was also sometimes clunky and jumpy. It rushes the ending but spends too long on a couple of scenes in the second act. However, the majority of the film stays consistent and smooth.There is also a lack of character development, and there are no real arcs to follow. We don't see any of the characters change throughout except for the end scene, but there is no gradual shift of attitude toward each other, they just start off disliking each other one moment; then just start loving each other...The film also suffers from a painfully weak villain, who we learn very little about nor do we know why he's there in the first place. He isn't particularly fear inducing or scary, and is just a complete cruel idiot for no reason whatsoever. The climax is also rushed, underwhelming and a slight let-down.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is great fun and the comedy is brilliant and clever. The actors are excellent and their perfect for their role; they're most definitely likeable! The action is great and so's the chemistry between the characters, but does suffer from typical action clichés, however in the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is absolutely great!","8/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","FelipeCarrillo","30 December 2017","Art is the quality, activity or product executed from the fruit of skills, keeping a core artistic and communicative purpose, an own idea that is materialized through different resources predisposed by humans that ends up influencing what people think and feel, a way of expressing, a way of manifesting. Over the years, the evolution of man has stirred up the emersion of disparate disciplines, always focused on the aesthetic conception overlaid by the time, which were established as Arts, they were officially enumerated by Ricciotto Cuckold in 1911; dance, music and poetry form a reserved list of expressions whose basis is the exhibition of personal thought in response to the events of the world, each of these intervened, of course, by the perceptions and styles of the artist, thus placing originality, imagination and creativity as cardinal tools. Within this prodigious series of acts is the one which, personally, I consider the mother of all arts: cinema, clearly. The Seventh Art, as many call it, is capable of encompassing any of the traditional arts disseminated by human senses, it manages to join movements, narrations, colors and melodies by means of picture and sound. Precisely, an audio-(sound, hearing) visual (vision) experience represents the perfect mold, one in which each individual takes the role of emitter and receiver. From its birth on 28 December 1895 from the hand of the Lumière brothers to my latest showing on 28 December 2018 have passed 123 years of stories, biographies, tales, loves and disappointments, betrayals and loyalties, surprises and speeches; cinematic annals raised by masterpieces, debuts, sequels, trilogies or octologies from different men and women who show intimate insights on millions of screens around the world weekly, creating a range of universes that have written, officially, the highly controversial History of Film. At this point, today, it's revealed the difficulty of each release hitting cinemas to add something fruitfully n brand-new to the Book of Celluloid. More than half of them culminate in either average or deeply deceptive flicks, being only a small minority which gets to take a place, at least, in golden headlines from the best of the year, here, the actor germ: the lack of originality. This problem, sharply commented by this reviewer, affected and continues to affect the creative minds of Hollywood, the cinematic power that being on the brink of the abyss, opts to reuse, literally, proposals from the past, using new faces to get a new audience who shows interest in seeing more of the same, then, Will we get to the point where cinema establishes a unique series of stories on which the thousands of filmmakers work? We pray for no more recycling of ideas.Within the culture broth that has become American cinema, lies adaptation, remake, reboot and continuation; ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" drinks from these four disadvantaged categories. A hybrid that becomes an adaptation of the mythical reference book, a remake of the legacy and mythology of 90's story, a reboot of the time and customs in which the tale develops, a sequel when posing a contemporary plot with a fascinating twist, and even reaches to play with homage in certain fragments that venerate the motion picture from twenty-two years ago. With sufficient controversy and critic, more non-exemplary ideas are cooking up, desperately, with major studios as sponsors, while, quietly and gradually, small indie productions are dedicated to being such small minority.Jake Kasdan directs the flick that means the kick off for a possible needless saga of stories that, according to the grossing at the box office - which are predicted favorable -, will have the chance of arriving in the years to come. Basically, the mythology is preserved, a mythical board game in which every roll of the dice means a drastic change in the real world of the players, however, the variable in the declared sequel reverses the rules, it's founded on the transporting of the players inside the game - now video game cassettes - personified by the sexiest, most hilarious and requested movie stars of today. So far, everything looks interesting and potentially functional, however, this game is missing pieces. The script starts to waver hardly in the introduction of the new batch of actors, some high school boys who fit perfectly in the stereotyped juvenile roles, only, to pour them in the cloned characters of modern cinema. Although the film takes its time presenting the four young protagonists, the spectator never gets good vibes with any of them due to a lousy and clichéd sketch of characters, their attitudes fall into the abhorrent common places and end up in those same places. It's worth highlighting the high level of predictability that the script shows, it's possible to anticipate each move that story is going to execute, besides, adding a poor chemistry and charm between the quartet of the young characters. In the first act, there is a framing in which the four are seated side by side awaiting their punishment, however, there is an empty chair, opening the opportunity to foreshadow the sudden appearance of the character that would become the comic relief, but not, It's just an empty chair until the half the footage, at least, a pinch of subversion. Likewise, we shouldn't expect any kind of identification with the plastic avatars in the jungle-themed game, equally pigeonholed in the roles of strength, intelligence, beauty and stupidity; nor with an antagonist who allows different disgusting insects come out from inside his ears or mouth. Yeah man, the film knows how to build up ephemeral situations in which the vis comica of each one of them pops up, nevertheless, it never touches the same emotional, comical and even sinister dimensions of the feature film directed by Joe Johnston, where we watched a newcomer Kirsten Dunst along with the acting master Robin Williams. It's indisputable that thanks to the busiest and most popular cast, led by the always hilarious Jack Black, the story remains standing and manages to stretch a dynamic and kinetic pace as much as possible, however, it does by an odious predictability and some visual landscapes that don't exploit the huge possibilities that they held in their hands, even though most of the locations are real places (Hawaii) and its special medium-level digital effects. As is customary in these types of proposals, the film is as chaotic as the situations it exhibits due to traditional symptoms, that are hidden behind all the creative process. The first and main trigger is the number of screenwriters, four writers proposing and laughing at an executive table while they prepare a cocktail of dramatic and sidesplitting moments as unequally functional as necessarily witty. Chris McKenna, the man behind ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" and ""The LEGO Batman Movie"" - two of the superhero jewels of the year - was responsible for writing the global story, but apparently, it seems to have left all his powerful ideas in his previous works. Leaning ingeniously and respectfully on the world of video games, the central plot follows a traditional structure and doesn't provide eminent strangeness that should be the salvation key for this kind of movies, those that set up its stories more in the humor of the situations than in the humor of tale as such. As a strong point, a cunning, subtle play around the video-game-themed background, the screenwriters gave with an ingenious magical formula to overturn the storylines or the different settings of newfangled video game consoles with, of course, a narrative and parody purpose, however, many of these situations work well, even though the film is riddled with them.Jake Kasdan's ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" brings together three of the funniest movie stars of the moment, one ""Doctor Who"" Scottish actress and one former member of the American pop-rock band Jonas Brothers to deliver a free-entertainment film with the exact doses of nostalgia and new content, devoid of any drop of true originality, but brimming with one-liners and comical moments that follows the proper procedures of the typical mega-studio productions in the genre. A funny follow-up to close a year of surprising cinema of just quality, therefore, simply stays in that way, in a correct and admissible time killer, not something really substantial. One more play in the lucrative game called Hollywood. A game, just that.","6/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Darryl_Lazakar01","24 December 2017","Wow, just when you thought this movie will bomb... When it was first announced, everyone has low expectations for the stand-alone sequel to the late Robin Williams's 1995 hit. Everyone believes it's going to be a massive failure..Then BOOM! Defying everyone's expectations, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a surprisingly fun, enjoyable movie, that manages to stay true to the originals, while at the same time, might be one of the best video game movie so far.For starters, Dwayne Johnson once again proves that he's likable in every role he recieves, and his role as Smolder Bravestone speaks for itself. Kevin Hart literally plays himself, and he did a great job as Franklin Finbar. Karen Gillan did a great job as Ruby Roundhouse, despite being in a uncomfortable (and controversial) outfit. Jack Black is also really good in his role as Oberon. Nick Jonas also did a good job as Seaplane. The teenagers (Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Morgan Turner, and Madison Iseman, playing the real-life counterparts of Dwayne, Kevin, Karen, and Jack's characters respectively) did a great job as well.One of the things that made this movie works really well, is the ""fish-out-of-the-water"" story. Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan, all play a role that's not familiar to them, and they really did a great job. The pacing is perfect, explaining the plot right off the bat, resulting in a more fleshed out and more interesting story. Also, as the game is essentially a video game movie, there were plenty of video game references that some people might don't get it, but for those who understands, I think that it's a great throwback and a cool easter egg as well. The humor in this movie, it works perfectly. There's surprisingly plenty of sex jokes that works, but also not overused. The fight scenes are also very entertaining and over the top too (again, it's a ""video game"" movie, real life physics don't apply).Unfortunately, the movie does suffer from several aspects. The villain, played by Bobby Cannavale who btw did a good performance, like any other movie, is a simple, 1D character, who is simply evil. Though can be menacing, it doesn't change the fact that he's nothing more than some really evil guy who wants to rule everything and destroy anything stands in this way, etc. I also noticed that Kevin Hart's character is the only one of the main characters that is, seemingly not affected by the fish-out-of-the-water situation. I wish Kevin's performance were more out of his usual persona/fish-out-of-the-water performance, rather than playing as himself. Also, Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan has little to no chemistry whatsoever in their really odd awkward romance subplot, and the movie didn't take the more risky route, which is a shame since the final act is, personally, is kinda anticlimactic.Nevertheless, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle proves that Hollywood actually can make a good sequel to the old classics that brings something new to the table, while at the same time stays true to the originals. Fans of the original movie, while could be dissatisfied by the change from the board game to a video game, should watch this movie and came out satisfied, because I believe Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle captures the spirit of the original very well, and I'm really happy that it's actually really good and not just a bad attempt at milking money.Final Score: 8/10","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","metztex","24 March 2018","Spoilers are minor. No major plot give a ways. This film was very entertaining for me. While not as good as the original with Robin Williams, this film does provide a fresh updated look to the story line without compromising the precedent set in the previous film (unlike Last Jedi). Jack Black does an incredible job in this film and found myself laughing up a storm throughout. The Rock does well too but I could tell he was struggling a little with his character which is understandable and certainly not unforgivable. Bottom line, the Rock still did well. Main items I liked...Concept of teamwork!!! This true in everyday life. The struggles of two of characters to find their confidence in themselves is very well played and is great to see that gender is not considered in this area (it never should and is really irrelevant). Nicely done.On the flip side..bringing the other two down to earth into the real world from off their supposed high pedestals was also very nicely done. The football star suddenly stripped of his physical prowess and forced to deal with what most individuals have to on a day to day basis was very well done. Additionally, bringing the popular girl and placing her in a man's body for a time without all the modern toys of her cyberspace life was very entertaining. Granted I grew up in during the time before the internet, let alone ubiquitous cell phone availability, so from my point of view, it is hilarious! If you like action adventure movies with comedy mixed in, and you liked the first Jumangi, chances are you will like this film. I found it entertaining with few slow or distracting sub-plots.","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Troy_Campbell","27 December 2017","Technically a sequel, but realistically a soft reboot, Jumanji 2.0 takes the central concept of the original and transforms it into an action-adventure outing for its digitally-savvy audience. Board games are out and video games are in. It won't win any awards for screenwriting with it's predictable and plodding plot-high school stereotypes must save the titular game-world by returning a stolen jewel-however the team of scribes get one big tick; the introduction of a body swap conceit generates consistent laughs. In fact, the broad comedy is consistently (and surprisingly) excellent. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit, sure, but the combination of the cast's comedic timing and their willingness to poke fun at themselves is a winning formula that absolutely shines through. Dwayne Johnson is his usual likable self as jungle explorer Dr Smolder Bravestone, Karen Gillan is a crack-up as the awkward bad-ass Ruby Roundhouse, Kevin Hart gives good Kevin Hart as sidekick Mouse Finbar, and Jack Black unequivocally steals the show as an egotistical ""hot-girl"" stuck in the body of overweight, middle-aged man Professor Shelly Oberon. The set pieces are decent without ever really impressing, the raft of winks and nods to the 1995 version earning enough goodwill to let the lack of originality slide for two-thirds of the movie. The final act, however, becomes quite the slog to get through as the comedy is swept aside in favour of an action finale full of poor CGI, unmemorable sequences and an overacting Bobby Canavale as the sneering villain. A flawed action movie, but a good-quality laugh-at-loud comedy, Jumanji is the epitome of Boxing Day family flick: dumb but hilarious, messy but entertaining.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Prismark10","4 April 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is belated sequel/reimagining of the 1995 film Jumanji. There is a loose link to the character played by Robin Williams in the original.Jumanji was known for its CGI wild animal stampede, however this film shows how much CGI has come on from those days.The film starts off a little like The Breakfast Club as four diverse high school kids get detention and come across an old video console containing the Jumanji video game. The teenagers get transported into another dimension where they become video game characters different to their real world counterparts.Spencer the nerdy gamer becomes the muscular Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) with no weaknesses. Fridge, his big football playing former friend becomes Bravestone's sidekick and zoologist, Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart) who must avoid cake. Narcissistic 'it' girl Bethany becomes chubby and turns into cartographer Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black.) Clever but insular Martha turns into a kick ass Lara Croft type adventurer, Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan.)The characters must work together to save Jumanji by returning a stolen artefact while encountering various dangers and henchmen.This is a comedy adventure with some video game tropes. I always felt that the original Jumanji was a rather clumsy fantasy adventure which did not get the comedy balance right.It helps that Johnson and Hart have worked together previously and riff off each other. Director Jake Kasdan, whose father Lawrence Kasdan wrote some of the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies makes something more than a cynical adventure film. He allows some character growth, such as Spencer and Martha coming close as themselves although there is a moment where Dr Bravestone does wonder if it would be better to stay as the avatar in a video game.An entertaining film which kids would especially enjoy.","7/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Fluke_Skywalker","21 February 2018","Plot; Four kids serving detention after school find an old video game system that pulls them in and makes them players in the game. Of the top-10 grossing (domestic) films released in '17, five were super hero/comic book based and one was a Star Wars film. Debuting strong and having exceptional stamina at the box office (currently sitting @ #5 and likely to pass Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 for the #4 slot within the next week), this (kinda) sequel to 1995's Jumanji clearly scratched an itch for moviegoers looking for a different kind of popcorn adventure. It's not that it's original in any meaningful way, but it's fresh by virtue of the characters not wearing capes or wielding lightsabers. Hitting its marks and checking off most of the requisite genre boxes, Juamnji: Welcome to the Jungle delivers a reasonably entertaining 2 hrs. thanks in no small part to its talented and game cast. If all that sounds like a backhanded compliment... .","7/10"

I mean, it has silly scenes plus Kevin Hart who's the little king of humour. How can't you laugh with this guy? And The Rock, who was supposed to be only an action character, actually did a pretty good job for his role, making us smile all the time. I especially liked the ""heated"" moments, where things got serious & effervescent, because there was where the action really happened. Teenagers who learned to burst their ""comfort - zone"" bubble, got some teamwork skills and managed to successfully complete the game and return to the real life. What an adventure for them and for us!","5/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","jboothmillard","14 January 2018","The original Jumanji is one of my favourite movies of my childhood, I remember seeing it twice in the cinema, so it was surprising to find out there would be either a sequel or a reboot, having seen a couple of trailers I was certainly interested, directed by Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher). Basically it opens in 1996, in Brantford, New Hampshire, teenager Alex Vreeke (Mason Guccione) is given the board game Jumanji by his father, after it buried in the sand on a beach. Alex ignores it, being a board game, but in the night the game magically transforms into a video game cartridge, when he plays it, he is teleported into the game. Twenty years later, four students at Brantford High School are in detention, Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff) who is caught writing essays for Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain), who is also in detention for the plagiarism, while Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman) and Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner) have been disrespectful towards teachers. Principal Bentley (Marc Evan Jackson) ridicules the four teenagers and assigns them to clean up the basement, specifically removing staples from hundreds of magazines ready for recycling. The four find an old video games console, and Jumanji, the multiplayer action-adventure video game, they decide to play, each choosing one of the four playable character avatars, the fifth one is inaccessible, when Spencer hits Start, the four are sucked into the game. They find themselves in the jungle, each now in their game avatars, Spencer is now tough, muscular explorer Dr. Xander ""Smolder"" Bravestone (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), Fridge is short zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart) (he misread the name as ""Moose""), Martha is gorgeous commando and martial art expert Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Bethany is an overweight, male cartographer named Professor Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (Jack Black). They realise they have been transported into the video game, they each have three lives, each of their avatars have a set of skills and weaknesses, and if they lose, they will actually die. They meet the game's non-player character guide Nigel (Rhys Darby) who explains their mission, with a backstory; big-game hunter Russel Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) wants to obtain the ""Jaguar's Eye"", a jewel that controls all animal life in the jungle. To win the game and go home, the players must return the jewel to an enormous jaguar statue and call out ""Jumanji"". Along the way, the group begins to lose lives through various means when completing levels in the game, but they work together to obtain the clues and continue on, whilst also trying to get away from the various creatures, and Van Pelt's men. The group are rescued in a game level by Alex (Nick Jonas), the fifth player, his avatar is pilot Jefferson ""Seaplane"" McDonough, he has been staying in a treehouse, built by Jumanji player Alan Parrish, because he has only one remaining life, Alex is shocked to learn that he has been trapped in the game for twenty years, the newcomers vow to help him get out. In the next level, they commandeer a helicopter and fly for the jaguar statue to return the Jaguar's Eye, upon landing Alex loses his last life after a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs CPR in time, transferring one of her lives to Alex, saving him from dying. The group arrive at the statue, they find themselves surrounded by Van Pelt's forces and predatory guards, the five players working together, using their resources and skills, to distract the villains. The jewel is successfully returned to the statue, and they all call ""Jumanji"", the game ends, Van Pelt disintegrates into many rats, and the players return home, back to their former selves. Back in the real world, Alex is not with the other four, returning home, they find Vreeke household is no longer derelict, they find Alex (Colin Hanks) is now an adult, he was transported back to 1996, history was changed, and he is now married with a daughter named Bethany, in honour of the one who saved his life. In the end, Spencer and Fridge reconcile their friendship, Bethany becomes a better person with more socialising, and Martha starts dating Spencer, the four friends hear Jumanji's drumbeat in the school, they destroy it with a bowling ball to prevent anyone playing it again. Also starring Missi Pyle as Coach Web and Tim Matheson as Old Man Vreeke. Johnson also producing is always the reliable action hero, Hart and Black provide the laughs, and Gillan caused controversy with her costume, tiny shorts and a low-cut top, she is sexy and good at being the tough chick. This stand-alone sequel does reference the original, and has a nice tribute to former star Robin Williams, but it can be counted as its own movie, this one relies more on the laughs, the storyline is patchy but just about engages you, I really think it could have done with more danger, more creature encounters, but the special effects are done well, all in all it is a relatively fun action adventure comedy. Worth watching!","3/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","ayoreinf","25 December 2017","The original Jumanji is one of my all time favorites, of its genre. Mostly because on top of being a very effective kid fantasy movie, it uses cinematic language in a way that calls for very careful viewing. Something I didn't expect, and loved finding. (I always love this sort of a surprise). You won't find this clever usage of cinematic language in this one, but eventually it does make up for ir in a more straight forward manner, while not being any less clever. This one is a very well done movie. Superb acting, even though its often done in an underhanded style or maybe I should use the term subtle in this case. Anyhow, the greatest acting bits aren't obvious or spectacular, but are still there. When Dwayne Johnson ""smolders"", when Jack Black is being Bethany, when Karen Gillan is being Martha. I can't say any more without revealing too much, see the movie - you'll understand what I'm speaking about. Beyond the acting, this one is very carefully crafted to force actual teamwork, not just an instinctive support that was there in abundance in the original movie. In this one the group actually plans its moves repeatedly. I'm not saying there's no instinctive ""light bulb"" moments, but they too come as part of the story - it's a very well written story. The pacing, the editing, the CGI, and all other technical aspects of the movie are well above par. Bottom line - great fun movie with some added value to boot. Go see it, you'll have a blast.","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","MuviFan73","2 January 2018","What is a game? I say, it's not something from where we cannot get out alive. Thus I liked the part where three lives were awarded to every counterpart playing the game, in main lead.The second thing I liked is that, if challenges were given, strengths in the form of respected avatars were given either way, to accomplish the given tasks.I also liked the part where it was possible to destroy game apparatus, thus saving the movie from getting into horror genre.Final verdict: Although I expected better, it is still worth a watch.","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","MovieHead123","8 March 2018","I was skeptical at first because sequels usually turn out to be a disappointment, hence Mean Girls 2 and every Scream movie after the original one. I can name so many sequels in where I thought to myself, ""The should have just stopped after the first one"". I thought I'd feel the same way about Jumanji 2 Welcome To The Jungle, especially since the first one is one of the best movies of all time. It is a movie i shared with my daughter in hopes that it'd bring as much joy to her as it did to me as a child. Robin Williams and Kristin Dunst, talk about two of the most recognized actors in the 90's. Robin Williams played a big role in my childhood, as he brought so much laughter into my home with all of his movies, such as Mrs. Doubtfire, Ferngully, Aladdin, etc. He's the only celebrity who I've shed tears for when hearing the tragic news of his death (besides Anton Yelchin, that one hit me pretty hard too). Anyway, back to the point. You could see why my expectations for the second Jumanji were just ""blah"" so to speak. Boy, was I wrong! Of course, it doesn't compare to the original. However, it is absolutely hilarious and very entertaining. Not one dull moment. I LOVED IT! I could not stop laughing. I also choked up a bit in the end when grownup Alex tells Bethany that he named his daughter after the girl who saved his life. I always enjoy watching Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson. I love Kevin Hart as an actor, but not a fan of his standup. Anyway, I definitely recommend this movie. I gave it a 10. I gave the original Jumanji a 10 as well. but that's only because I couldn't give it a 20.","3/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","sjalkarjadottir","10 March 2018","... exceeded an expectation that was very low to start with though. I did like the chemistry between the characters, i liked the casting ... and it was an all in all very enjoyable movie.I was not blown away by the story though.. the story and the storytelling was stale and boring. It also seemed not to really know what it was trying to do with the game itself. If it was to be a computer game .. there were only very few and rather annoying snippets of what some computer games are like (like dumb NPCs and so) .. while if it was an adventure movie, those game sections felt out of place. While i liked the idea of it being a computer game, the director did not go the whole way .. and so it wasn t more than a little side feature, easily forgotten and irrelevant.The effects were rather bad in some scenes and OKish in others. CGI is not yet there though .. especially the animals looked very very bad (maybe they were meant to?) and did not blend into the world at all.However ... as i said, the character were good, and the movie as a whole was enjoyable.. just not outstanding.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","kastri_gr","15 January 2018","Junmaji Welcome to the jungle was a movie i couldn't expect it could be so exciting.The first Jumanji was very good thanks to Robin Williams who in my modest opinion was a very talented actor not only a comedian but this new version of Jumanji it was a pleasant shock for me.To begin with the movie is set first in 1996 when the jumanji board game was found on a beach and later we see the board game transformed to a video game for Atari console.The first person who plays transfered automatically to Jumanji in the jungle as a pilot and he waited there for 20 years until four young people (who were on detention in a highschool for mutlple reasons) found the Jumanji video game and they also transfered to the jungle as adventurous persons with great knowledge.Though someone can expect what he/she will see Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson act very funny in the movie such as Karen Gillan and Kevin Black give an awesome perfomance and i almost forgot the Van Pelt enemy in the Jumanji who is different in this new movie played by Bobby Cannavale.Rumors say that there is an alternative ending in which the Jumanji turns to a mobile application stated by the actress Karen Gillan.For me it is a movie ofcourse not for an oscar nomination but a movie with lots of fun and it is worth to be seen it in the cinema.","10/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","farismatthew-53074","11 January 2018","You know I feel like not enough people say this so looks like it is up to me, Hollywood needs to get original. I have personally watched a lot of the movies coming out recently and while sitting through this one it occurred to me that most of the are just remakes or sequels. why do people even go see these I mean went twice but that's because I take my reviews very seriously and look for minor details. The average person shouldn't be going around watching movies which have no original ideas, I mean you look at something like suicide squad, a great movie btw, and you realize that nothing like that has never been done before. I mean everything about it was original and compared to jumango, or what ever the name for this movie is, you realize that it is just a movie trying to be funny by reusing every joke ever heard. Overall the acting was sub par the worst by far being Jack Black. I had high hopes for him after his performance in Goose Bumps but man he really feel apart i guess. When it comes down to it I would say that if you do see this movie try to sneak in to as to avoid giving another unoriginal movie money.","5/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Vartiainen","4 March 2018","You know what, in this age of endless remakes and soft reboots, I actually think that a sequel to Jumanji is not actually all that terrible an idea. I mean, the original 1995 adventure film already hinted at possible sequels with its ending and the story and the world of Jumanji is such that you can tell countless stories with it. Plus, it also has the fact going for it that the original film was not a great one. I mean, it's good and nowadays more than nostalgic, but it's not a masterpiece. There is room for improvement here.And while I do not think that this film surpasses the original, it does come very close to matching it in quality. It keeps the lighthearted, tongue in cheek tone of the original, updates the visuals, changes the story enough to remain interesting, while still wholeheartedly feeling like a Jumanji story.What I liked the most were the actors. The ones playing the actual teenagers were okay, even if their characters are about as three-dimensional as the original Super Mario Bros game. But it's the characters playing the game characters that are the saving grace here. From Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan as two invincible heroes to Jack Black and Kevin Hart as their bumbling sidekicks. The fact that they have to act like they're being controlled by teenagers is admittedly a cheap joke, but it's a joke that keeps on giving. Especially Black as a self-centered queen bee brat.And that's actually the perfect way to sum up the film. Its humour and entertainment value are... cheap... -ish, no way around it, but it's just the right kind of cheap. Perhaps I do miss the more serious moments and actual drama of the original just a little bit, and I cannot say that the film gets modern teenagers particularly well, but on the other hand the action scenes are better, the locations are more interesting and it's simply too much fun to disdain in any meaningful way.Grab a bucket of popcorn, pop a soda, lean back and take a trip to the jungles of Jumanji. Watch out for the hippos.","7/10"

It was so much more fun than I imagined it could be. The humour was brilliant and the acting was spot on and you never forgot that the adult faces you know so well are actually the teenagers that started the film, because they play them so well!Also I loved the little details such as in-game characters repeating their lines as it makes you feel like you are a kid again playing a video game as well as watching a great movie. The original was a classic and in my opinion this film took it to the next level with the use of new technology, imagination, a different angle, great writing and as I mentioned, brilliant acting.","5/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","CANpatbuck3664","31 December 2017","If you play video games and are open to the actors/actresses in this cast, it would be hard not to geek out over this concept. Video game movies are hit and miss at best and maybe this was a new way to help that along. They took an existing property and made it a video game movie. There were cool instances where they brought in aspects of video games that genuinely worked (I liked the non-playable character gag where they can only have a few responses) and then there were other times where it was a little awkward and didn't translate effectively (the concept of the lives was a little clunky, they lost lives falling from some heights and not others and then using CPR to transfer one?). I have to admire their ambition but only partial points for execution.This is an action/comedy geared more towards families than adult audiences. Does it work on that level? I would say yes. The movie isn't hilarious but there were plenty of times where I was chuckling, and it also had some decent action in it. I don't think the movie was exceptional in either area, but it did its job. I did like how they brought in some Indiana Jones style elements too. Using specific traps and the returning the treasure to its rightful place were nice additions and made it feel like it was playing towards an old school adventure movie.I did have a couple of big problems with this movie. I felt like the characters of the kids were way too stereotypical (the awkward nerd, the self-involved pretty girl, the dumb jock etc.). I know that they can't be all completely fresh characters, but they still could have added a little more dimension by going in a different direction. The other is that the movie has some dialogue so bad that it will make you roll your eyes and snicker. I couldn't help but giggle at it (in an unintentionally funny way) and I know the movie is directed at kids but again I think they could have put a little more effort in. Other than playing with this cool idea, I thought the script for this was pretty mediocre. I also had a personal nitpick about more contemporary gaming being not referenced at all but that's admittedly due to the fact I wasn't involved in that era of gaming and I don't have a detailed memory of those type of games.As much as I had a couple of problems with the material, I wouldn't blame any of the main cast for it. Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman and Morgan Turner as Spencer, Fridge, Bethany and Martha were all okay. They didn't really impress me, but I think that was more the material than anything. The adult actors all really sold out. Dwayne Johnson is his usual charming self, Kevin Hart is funny in spurts, Karen Gillan was great in her role and the meta jokes about her character were pretty funny. Jack Black was just short of mugging the entire movie but he was one of the few actors who could have made his part work. The biggest surprise was that I didn't mind Nick Jonas all that much. Bobby Cannavale is a good actor but his villain was so forgettable that it wasn't worth an actor of his calibre.I was psyched going into this movie, the scores across the board were better than expected and I thought the marketing for it was pretty good. I walked out having enjoyed Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle but I did feel like it had the potential to be even better. Its doing well at the box office so maybe I'll like the sequel (if there is one) that much more. I would definitely like to see this cast again with the strong chemistry they had.

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","NoPantsBatman","6 January 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, the story of four teenagers, Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman) and Martha (Morgan Turner), who got stuck in a magical video game, which only way out is by finishing the game. It's a good concept, and the director Jake Kasdan delivered it in a funny way.While in the game, the teenagers transform into the characters they selected, which are played by Dwayne Johnson as Spencer, Kevin Hart as Fridge, Jack Black as Bethany and Karen Gillan as Martha. This transformation was a trigger for all of them to start questioning who they really are and to realize some of the problems and correspondent solutions to their problems. With a lot of adventure and a lot of funny moments, the movie definitely was not boring, and even though it had some corny moments, it was very enjoyable.As usual, Kevin Hart didn't disappoint with his humor. I just love seeing this actor in action. In my opinion, he deserved a bit more of screen time, but to be fair, the rest of the actors had to have their own time, and it was well distributed, I didn't feel like some got more attention than others, which is a good thing.Another thing that this movie succeeded to deliver was the feel and experience of a video game with ""real life graphics"". As a gamer, it was really funny to imagine myself in some of their situations. I don't want to spoil, you should see for yourself.Overall, the movie delivers what's intended: a Jumanji sequel. It has a lot of adventure, comedy and some good old life-changing moments. A solid 7 out of 10.","1/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","wycherleyp-960-470658","4 January 2018","I hate it when Hollywood decided to cash in on a beloved title so I did not go into this film with much hope, 
From the opening scene that was more or less a copy and paste from the ending of the original Jumanji it did not sit well with me.Thankfully this Jumanji film took me by surprise as it turned out to not be a reboot or Evan a sequel but a fresh new take on the game.A updated version of Jumanji that now involves it being a video game and not a board game. With a great cast from Karen Gillan to Dwayne the rock Johnson Jumanji is a brilliant fun film that edges on being a family film with some strong language but used in a comedy style.From the start of the game to the end Jumanji welcome to the jungle is a great start to 2018 and to be honest it's a film that was needed after a awful 2017 for films.With supporting cast from Jack black to kevin Hart Jumanji is a successful new take on a beloved title and I'll admit that I was wrong!","5/10"

"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","maclock","22 February 2018","I went to see Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle because I failed to correctly recall the start time of the movie that I had wanted to see and because my sister spoke positively about it. How I wish that I had gone home instead! Long story short, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a pretty bad film. I wouldn't bother watching it if I were you. Pass.","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","adamgill-45012","15 November 2018","If you want a film with many genuinely funny comedy moments, mucho action - and very little to think about - then Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is for you!The premise is a la ""Tron"" - players sucked into an alternate ""game world"" with levels and quests to boot. The action is riddled with well-placed comedy and I did actually find myself laughing out loud. I also found myself sometimes uttering the next line in a very formulaic presentation (""...it's game over, man.."")A fun family action film with a bit of everything. The (comedy) acting is top notch, the action, pace and storyline is very predictable - and it is very, very watchable!","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","slimboy-63866","27 January 2018","They should label this as a kids movie, and it might be boring even for kids ! just watched the first 30 minutes . what a waste of time","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","blumdeluxe","9 February 2020","""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" tells the story of four teenagers that are sucked into a computer game and have to work together in order to win back their former lives while at the same time adopting to the new roles they've been given in this world full of dangers and threats.It is in a way logical to transfer the classic Jumanji story into modern times by just turning the board into a video game. Apart from the fact that the whole concept of getting sucked into a game seems pretty uncreative to me in general, this is a thought that I understand. The way it is carried out is actually decent. You can watch the movie with less cringe than I've feared, some lines are nice or funny. However, I just don't get rid of the feeling that this is more a cash cow than it is the personal interest of someone to make a good film. The result is your typical Hollywood blockbuster that everyone can live with but no one will call particularly priceworthy or remarkable.All in all this is a decent movie for what it is supposed to be. It is not more and in a way not necessary but you can spend an entertaining evening and forget about it afterwards.","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","miltrobinreynolds","25 March 2018","I cry rarely. It must be an extraordinarily strong emotional movie for me to cry watching a movie. I cried watching A Beautiful Mind. Why did I cry watching Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle? Story was similar to that of Galaxy Quest (a great favorite of mine). But that's not why I cried. Humour was funny, some of it adolescent, but still funny. Moral of the story was good. All of the actors believable, interestingly complex. But that's not why I cried. I cried because I resonated with the feelings portrayed by the geeky couple. And for me, any movie that moves me to tears is a good movie. This is one that I'll buy and watch again.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","alancitolee","6 March 2022","I haven't seen the original so I was curious.I think it hits the mark for the age range it's aimed at. I am 49 and sat down with Mum and Dad and enjoyed it.I think the concept of gaming draws me in because i remember the history of games since i was a teen. It was 8 bit, dodgy little sprites, good tunes and excellent game play. Very basic compared to nowThe character development, humour and teeny romance is good enough.The only thing is that the level of mystery, intrigue and suspence is minimal. There is little depth to the story. I think someone pointed out that the development of the bad guy is pretty thin. CGI is per usual too much and not good enough to grab imagination. This flattens everything for me most of the time.But funny and entertaining. Interesting characters. Plenty of dramatic clichés from Hollywood's store: ""gee, you were ace... Oh really, thanks..."". But i got into the romance and it's good light entertainment.","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","mark.waltz","2 July 2023","If there was ever a movie character whom I wanted to see walk into an open manhole (while constantly on their phone) is the vapid, self-centered character played by Madison Iseman who is beyond annoying to watch. Fortunately she's not on the screen for long, somehow turning into Jack Black as part of an online Jumanji game, but those minutes she is turns out to be worse than a week of detention. Fortunately the other three teenagers don't give motive for total Gen Z hatred, only being just moderately vapid and immature. The follow-up to the 1995 hit took 22 years to come up, only having a few references to the events of the previous film, so it's like a fresh start.The charismatic Dwayne Johnson is the avatar for another one of the characters, amused by his sudden abundance of muscle. They are all the antithesis of who they were in the real world, and it's poetic justice to see the popular girl who shouldn't be popular become the hefty Black, his scream at his reflection a delight. So this one has the characters in the jungle rather than the wildlife in suburbia, and seeing the adult actors acting like teens is added amusement. Black gets eaten by a hippo, gets taught how men urinate, and basically slams social media and mean girls through the character being obsessed with it and defending Iseman's behavior. I didn't feel the need to understand what's beneath the surface. Not as original as its predecessor, but it has its charms, is fast moving and funny, and full of intensity.","7/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","martin-powondra","26 October 2018","I liked the original and so I was a bit confused when they made a second part after 20 years, but it is amazing fun, better story and great actors!
I really enjoyed it.
Way better than the original!","9/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","paul_haakonsen","9 June 2018","Granted, initially I had somewhat dreaded to sit down and watch ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" after having heard nothing but bad reviews and heard bad talks about this movie. And let's be honest, the original ""Jumanji"" movie with Robin Williams was indeed a classic in its own right.But still, I went to watch this sequel with my wife, and it turned out that it was actually a blast of an entertaining movie, and they captured the essence of the old movie while actually managing to upgrade the formula to a more up-to-date recipe.Lots of action and fast-paced adventure in the movie, and it is mixed up with a pinch of comedy and witty characters, so what's not to like?The CGI effects in the movie were quite nice and used well. Which essentially made the movie not overly reliant on being a CGI special effects galore.I was initially a bit concerned about having Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black in a movie such as this, but they actually carried the movie quite nicely.If you enjoyed the original ""Jumanji"" movie then you definitely should take the time to watch ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"".","10/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","kz917-1","10 April 2018","Ridiculously enjoyable. Definitely not for the very young as there are several crude/borderline adult jokes throughout the movie.All of the actors did fantastic jobs and brought zany comedic moments all through the film.Worth the rental for certain.","6/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","Triviagrasshopper","19 January 2022","Really wishing I hadn't been a snob when I heard this movie was going forward. Topping OG Jumanji? Impossible. Not wasting my time with a remake/spin-off that would tarnish an iconic Robin Williams classic. Robin Williams would have begged for a cameo if he'd been alive to read the script. Jack Black playing a teenage girl? HILARIOUS. They managed to build a sequel that not only holds its own against the original, but isn't really a sequel. I wasn't constantly comparing it to the original. Aside from the backbone of the original Jumanji (the name, the character trapped for 20 + years in the game, etc) storyline, they managed to make it better yet still pay homage to the original. I didn't feel like I was watching a rip-off of the first movie. I haven't even watched the 3rd movie yet but I'm already hoping there's plans for a 4th in the works.","8/10"
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle","studioAT","5 December 2019","The original 'Jumanji' starring the much missed Robin Williams was so beloved by so many, that I was sceptical about this film when it came out.Thankfully the original is both name checked and the spirit of it very much maintained in this fun sequel, that boasts some big action sequences and laughs along the way.I liked how tongue in cheek it all was also, with all the main cast clearly having the time of their lives.It obviously hit a chord with viewers, as at the time of writing another sequel is about to be released.","10/10"
