"Incredibles 2","Anthonyjkb","10 November 2018","Good: The animation for this movie was excellent just like most other Pixar movies, it was funny (especially Jack Jack) and I really liked the action sequences throughout the movie. I liked that the movie showed that parenting (when done right) can be heroic.Bad: I thought this film has quite a few problems, the biggest problem was that the ending was pretty predictable, I could see it coming. Also, there was a feminism theme with Helen which was okay but at times it seemed to shove it in my face and it got to be annoying. There seemed to be a little too much going on in the movie and a few too many characters.I'm glad I saw the movie, I just don't think I would see it again anytime soon.","

"Incredibles 2","Reckno64","31 March 2019","While I understand the disappointment, this was NOT a bad film. It isn't as good as the first one, but I think it holds up pretty well! There's lots of fun to be had watching this from the animation to the humor, and there are still some touching scenes that show there is heart put into this film. I recommend seeing CinemaWins ""Everything GREAT about Incredibles 2"" if you want to see why this film is still pretty decent. Only somewhat weak spot in my opinion was the main villain who was somewhat predictable, but man the animation at times truly is ""Incredible"" (pun intended)!Go see it! It was well worth my time and I enjoyed it, so I'm surprised to see it get all these 1 star reviews. Far from Pixar's best but still a good flick. I know you can't please everyone but I think this movie is terribliy overhated. That's just my opinion at least. 9 stars out of 10!","

"Incredibles 2","TheLittleSongbird","30 July 2018","Have always been a big fan of Pixar, liking to loving pretty much all their short films (particularly 'Presto', 'One Man Band', 'Geri's Game', 'Piper' and 'Knick Knack'). Also like to love a vast majority of their feature films, my favourites being the 'Toy Story' films, 'Up', 'Coco' and 'Inside Out' and my least favourites being the 'Cars' sequels and 'The Good Dinosaur'.While not one of my favourite Pixar films, 'The Incredibles' is still a very, very good film that has gone even higher in my estimations after a well overdue re-watch to get myself prepared for 'Incredibles 2', fantastically animated, exciting, funny, emotionally investable and ground-breaking with great characters. Expectations were high for its long awaited sequel fourteen years on, and while it is not as good a film, and what could and should have been super and incredible wasn't quite, on the most part 'Incredibles 2' was worth the wait.'Incredibles 2' does lack 'The Incredibles' originality (not much new here) and its emotional impact and character development is also not as good, the latter particularly is noticeably thinner (Bob for example was more complex before). It was a little too long for a story as slight as it was, would have trimmed it by 15-20 minutes and tightened the first act's pacing with it taking a bit too much time to get going.Like others, among my biggest problems were to do with the villain. The villain was forgettable (one of Pixar's weakest easily), the twist concerning their identity that was too obvious too soon. Found their plan convoluted, that when explained made me want a re-wind button which was not possible in the cinema, and the motivation was pretty weak and extreme, took a while for me to get my head round. While the characters are fun, it did feel like there were too many, not sure whether it needed that many superheroes that aren't given enough to do other than in the climax.However, it may sound like 'Incredibles 2' was a bad film. It wasn't. Actually enjoyed it a good deal. The animation is fantastic, smooth, vibrant in colour and meticulous in background detail, some very striking details, a richly immersive setting and the characters are well designed. Michael Giacchino's score gets one in a rousing mood while also being dynamic with the action. The action is superbly animated and thrilling with real suspense and excitement.Writing has many moments of humour that provides a lot of laughs (Jack Jack steals the show here, especially with his powers and his fight with the racoon, with some nice lines later from Edna), moments that probe thought and drama that's relatable and never too sentimental (if not as poignant as one would like). The story does grip, more so in the Elastigirl story that really held my attention before the villain reveal underwhelmed. The family drama stuff is also very prominent, and while it is repetitive at times and there could have been less of it the best moments are very funny and it is very easy to relate to the dilemmas the characters face. Pacing mostly excites when things get going.Character development is nowhere near as strong here and it would have benefitted from less characters and more done with the existing characters and more thought with the villain and their plan/motivations, but the characters are mostly fun with the highlight being Jack Jack. The voice acting is terrific, especially from Holly Hunter, Craig T Nelson and Samuel L Jackson. Brad Bird is a lot of fun in Edna's small role and Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks are good additions.Overall, very enjoyable but wanted to like it much more. 7/10 Bethany Cox","

"Incredibles 2","NarniaIsAwesome","2 October 2018","'Incredibles 2' was probably the most anticipated movie of the year; it's hard to believe it's made 14 years since the first original. So obviously everyone was more than ready for this.The film does come through when it comes to entertaining action and comedy, with Jack-Jack, Bob, and Edna providing most of the biggest laughs. The plot is interesting, because we've got to know what happened to the Parr family. As far as the supervillain mystery, it's acceptable and somewhat entertaining, but a bit predictable and generic. The final criticism I have is that Edna definitely deserved more screen time.That being said, it is still an entertaining movie and not at all ""painful"" to watch.In conclusion, 'Incredibles 2' is funny, exciting, and really worth a viewing.","

"Incredibles 2","Lejink","9 February 2019","I loved the first ""The Incredibles"" and remember wondering why a follow-up hadn't been made soon after its success. Better late than never you might say but personally after watching this 14-years later sequel, I'm tending to better never than late. Somehow, for me, the movie just fell flat and didn't please me to anything like the degree of its predecessor.Don't get me wrong, the Pixar animation is fantastic as always, but somewhere along the line, the story, characters and humour lack something. The outlawed super-heroes / aliens / mutants theme has been done to death, from the X-Men to the Marvel Civil War right up to the current Supergirl TV series, likewise the husband and wife role-reversal with Mr Incredible's turn as three super-babies and a super-dad again seemed old-hat while Elastigirl's elevation to solo superstardom also felt a little like a forced and belated concession to PC-dom.I'm trying now to remember a really funny, laugh-out-loud line or memorable eye-popping sequence and I find I can't. The sub-plot of Violet and her young beau reminded me of any number of ""Married With Children"" episodes with like I said, a lack of good gags, plus Dash's characterisation was just irritating and new shape-shifting baby Jack-Jack (what kind of name is that?) even more so.For me, I found the film really dragged in places with its too predictable villain and unmemorable climax which no amount of flashy graphics could disguise. In truth I think that this sort of thing was done way better in ""Megamind"", ""Despicable Me"" and of course the first Incredibles feature.At leat I can't accuse it of being a quick cash-in but really this is one set of retired super-heroes which should have remained on the shelf.","

"Incredibles 2","Darth_Osmosis","3 August 2018","There is much to like here and not much that is outright wrong or bad. It's funny, fast paced, clever and overall works quite well. However there is an ever present feeling that the first one was better.. Maybe it's cause the plot is maybe a bit too predictable and cartoonish(yeah it IS a cartoon, but still..) or that the wait between the first and this one was so long and I expected something more? It's still good, just not great!","

"Incredibles 2","planktonrules","17 January 2019","I hate most sequels and don't think most of them are necessary...they are just an excuse to squeeze money out of the popularity of the first film. This is especially true to kids' films in recent years an it seems like a bazillion cartoons and CGI movies have been made and remade in a cynical attempt to make money. Are they any good? For most, I'd say no. However, I am happy I saw ""Incredibles 2"" as it was worthy of the franchise and offers enough new content to make it worth your time.In this follow-up, super-heroes have been banned and the Incredibles family is not about to break the law. However, when an eccentric billionaire offers to help the family rehabilitate the image of heroes in an effort to get them unbanned, bad things are in store. It's not that he is evil....but someone around him has an agenda of their own. In the meantime, Mr. Incredible is forced to become a house husband...and he struggles with learning to parent effectively and live without using his super skills. Ultimately, however, the entire family is forced into action to not only save the day but Mrs. Incredible.Of all the recent kids films, I must say that ""Incredibles 2"" has the strongest feminist message. This is NOT a complaint. I liked seeing Mrs. Incredible become the family breadwinner and Mr. Incredible learn to be tender and a caregiver. There are also other feminist aspects of the story...but I'll say no more since it would spoil the plot!Overall, an incredibly well animated and thoroughly enjoyable film. Not exactly original (hence a score that isn't higher), but well worth seeing....unlike the countless ""Ice Age"" sequels and the like.","

"Incredibles 2","randomStuff101","20 November 2018","Half way through watching this in the cinema, I thought ""maybe it's me"". Maybe it's my fault I'm not into this movie. But I loved the original, so what's going on.No. The problem is this movie is a bland attempt to express messages about gender roles and current society issues. It lacks flow, it's just a bunch of scenes one after the other, there's no coherent thread or curious elements tying it together.Nice visuals goes without saying, but the story is let down by a sense that it's been engineered around a board room table by people referring to their social media feeds for inspiration, rather than dreamt up by talented writers.Sure, some scenes are fun. But we're not watching a youtube playlist here, this is a movie and it's supposed to work as a whole, not just momentarily.The script is uninteresting, the action is exciting sometimes, but other times you just want it to end or move on. Very disappointing.Toy Story 2 was a great sequel, but this is a very poor sequel. Forgettable.If you love the first, then hold onto that because it doesn't get better. It gets worse.","

"Incredibles 2","SnoopyStyle","29 October 2018","This follows after the first movie. Superheroes continue to be banned. The family battles a supervillain causing havoc in the city. They become outcasts, unemployed, and penniless. The wealthy Deavor siblings, heads of the tech company Devtech, recruit Frozone and then the family to make superheroes great again. They convince Elastigirl to be the face of the revival while Mr. Incredible has to play Mr. Mom.Generally speaking, this is fun. It's a solid superhero movie and a fine family adventure. There is one hilarious scene with Jack-Jack and a raccoon. The only misstep is wiping Tony's memories. It would be so much more compelling for Tony to know Violet's secret and have them deal with that. It would make the young romance much more powerful and more dangerous. He could be a damsel in distress or he could slip up with the secret. There are more possibilities with him knowing. I would like Dash to dial back the bratty kid act by a half level. This continues to be great for the loving family at its center. I love Mr. Incredible figuring out how to use Jack-Jack as a laser gun. It's a fun movie and a fun franchise.","

"Incredibles 2","Anurag-Shetty","15 July 2018","Incredibles 2 continues with the adventures of the Parr family including, Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible(Craig T. Nelson), Helen Parr/Elastigirl(Holly Hunter), Violet Parr(Sarah Vowell), Dashiell 'Dash' Parr(Huck Milner) & Jack-Jack Parr(Eli Fucile). This time Helen is out being the superhero, while Bob stays at home & takes care of the kids. Incredibles 2 is a supremely entertaining film. Writer-director Brad Bird makes sure that the 14 year gap between The Incredibles(2004) & this sequel, is definitely worth the wait. The animation is flawless. The 3D is eye-popping. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. The humor is another strong point of the film. The talented cast who have lent their voices, make this movie unforgettable. Craig T. Nelson is outstanding as Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible. Holly Hunter is spectacular as Helen Parr/Elastigirl. Sarah Vowell is brilliant as Violet Parr. Huck Milner is superb as Dashiell 'Dash' Parr. Catherine Keener is amazing as Evelyn Deavor. Eli Fucile is adorable as Jack-Jack Parr. Bob Odenkirk is awesome as Winston Deavor. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as Lucius Best/Frozone. Michael Bird, Sophia Bush & Brad Bird are great as Tony Rydinger, Voyd & Edna Mode(E), respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Incredibles 2 surpasses The Incredibles(2004) in every way. It's a must watch. I hope I don't have to wait for another 14 years, to watch Incredibles 3!","

"Incredibles 2","proud_luddite","2 September 2018","Following the superb 2004 original, the family of animated superheroes are back. This time, they are struggling to regain a good reputation for superheroes (ostracized due to the collateral damage of their heroics) while also getting caught up in fighting a scheme against Screenslaver, a villain who hypnotizes victims with TV screen images.The idea of Screenslaver seems clever and almost touches on the modern world's collective obsession with technical devices and other forms of media. It doesn't quite get to the heart of the matter and misses an opportunity to be a clever critique of our current times. The theme even seems to be jumbled and incoherent at times.But overall, the film is saved by funny characters and doing what action-filled, comical, Hollywood blockbusters set out to do: be entertaining. It also succeeds in adding a twist to the genre by having female characters in the centre of hero/villain conflicts. A rather smart move considering the current dynamic in the film industry. - dbamateurcritic","

"Incredibles 2","ModishMovies","14 June 2018","Since I already know you are going to rate this review as ""Not Helpful"" because I didn't rate this 10/10 stars, I figured I might as well start off by telling you how much I love the original Incredibles. The Incredibles (2004) is one of my favorite films of all time and is my second favorite Pixar film (right after Finding Nemo). I got to see Incredibles 2 early because I caught a double feature of the two films in IMAX, just in case you were thinking of complaining that I didn't see it since this review is out early. What I loved about the original was the authenticity that the story, characters, and animation had to it. It felt more creative, natural, and beautiful. Syndrome was one of the greatest superhero movie villains of all time, not because of the amount of damage he was able to inflict upon the world, but because of the emotional pain he was able to cause Mr. Incredible and his family. The moments in which Mr. Incredible regrets his past mistakes and realizes how his actions affect others, especially his former biggest fan, are what makes the film stand out from any other hero-villain dynamic. Sadly, Incredibles 2 does not have a villain or story as deep or as thoughtful as Syndrome.Incredibles 2 boldly and intelligently begins right where The Incredibles ended. This smart move on Disney Pixar's part eliminates all confusion and time gaps that may arise after a hiatus of any amount (especially fourteen years) between a sequel and its predecessor. The story that follows is relatively contrived and characters are clumsily introduced in order to expand the universe instead of expanding the emotions of the beloved characters. The action scenes are creative and well-animated, but they aren't memorable enough and take place in bland settings and accomplish nothing for the characters. There were many points during this film where I noticed how hard Brad Bird was trying to replicate the formula of the original film, but it became more and more noticeable to the point that it detracted from the story itself. The great Pixar films all have excellent, fluid stories. The great Pixar films also have superb plots that deepen our understanding and feelings for the characters. The good Pixar films have entertaining, sensible plots, but they rarely deepen our love of the characters involved in them, such as A Bug's Life, Cars 2 (don't hate me!), Cars 3, and The Good Dinosaur. Incredibles 2, sadly, falls into the latter category that has a fun, creative plot, but a plot that does nothing new for its characters.Since the villain is introduced in the trailer, I don't think that it's a spoiler to say that it doesn't feel authentic or inspired enough to be considered one of Pixar's best villains. While the motive for the villain is there, it is simply unnecessary, contrived, and unexciting. New heroes are also introduced (as seen in the poster and other promotional material). Many of them are underutilized or unnecessary. The film's weakest parts involve the newly introduced characters because they all lack the liveliness and creative spark of the original characters that are explored slightly more deeply in this film. But enough of the aspects of the film that let me down. For all of the disappointments, Incredibles 2 also has many surprises and amazing qualities. For one, Jack Jack's new abilities are basically perfect, both in what his powers are and in how they are revealed. At first, I worried that too much of Jack Jack's powers were revealed, but that was hardly the case. Jack Jack is actually one of the best parts of this film. He is easily one of the funniest parts of any Pixar film. I couldn't help but burst out in laughter every time he made a single noise. The humor in this film is slightly more present, or maybe more memorable, than in the original. The film's message also tries to be more important and necessary besides highlighting the importance of family.Obviously this review won't stop you from seeing this film, nor was it intended to, but I encourage all of you to see this film in theaters, but heavily reduce your expectations and don't think too much about what made The Incredibles nearly perfect, or you are sure to be sorely disappointed.","

As the family was put in hiding because they were outlawed, now comes an advocate trying to showcase the benefits of having these figures back on the street and out in the open. The movie does move slow and does not have the finesse of the first film. A few good lines but as in most sequels, that train has left the station. After a fun Incredibles 1, they had to disappoint with an Incredibles 2. Dr Wilson Trivino","

"Incredibles 2","sfgebel315","4 July 2018","I cannot believe it has been 14 years since The Incredibles came out. The gap between sequels seems to be getting longer, but the director, Brad Bird, said he wanted to wait until he had the perfect story. There's even a clip before the film starts where actors, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Holly Hunter tell us it will be ""well worth the wait""--and they were right!Though 14 years later, the film takes place minutes later. The first film ends with the Parr family having to fight the Miner who pops up out of the school parking lot, just after Violet gets a date with Tony. The sequel starts with that fight and we see how it backfires as the Parr family get arrested for destroying part of the city and because superheroes are still illegal. Enter our new characters, siblings Winston and Evelyn Deaver, who both want to help superheroes step back into the light, but they believe the way to do that is with Elastigirl. Therefore, our sequel twist is that Mr. Incredible becomes a stay-at-home dad having to babysit Jack-Jack and learning of his dozens of powers, teaching Dash ""new math"", and inserting his foot into his mouth when he tries to help Violet with her crush--all while Elastigirl is improving superhero relations. Personally, I thought the movie was predictable but perfect. I loved it for its simplistic plot that was not hard to figure out. I knew right away who the ""villain"" was and what their motivation was; however, I did not know exactly how the climax would occur, so I was still very much engaged. Not to mention there was enough character development and funny scenes to space out the predictable plot arch. Often times animated films are more for the adults who are taking the kids, then for the kids themselves. Most kids will not understand half the references, but will still enjoy the overall concept. At the same time, this film comes out when the kids who saw the first are now adults, possibly with kids of their own. Therefore, this film is a great blend of adult and child humor. I found it hilarious, and as a teacher, I particularly loved when Mr. Incredible stays up all night reading Dash's ""new math"" textbook so he can teach him new math, which was what it was called in the 60s (the time period this film alludes to) and is a shout out to our modern common core confusion. What I really love about this film is that there is even more Frozone and Jack-Jack, which brings me to my all-time favorite scenes--learning of Jack-Jack's powers, particularly when Violet and Dash call Uncle Frozone over because their dad is going insane from sleep-deprivation and trying to keep up with Jack-Jack. I lost track of how many powers he has and all I will say on the matter is that the best scene in the whole film is when Jack-Jack fights the raccoon. If you want a light-hearted comedy with some fun action sequences then this film is for you. If you loved the first one then you will love the second one. If you have not seen the first one, what's wrong with you?","

"Incredibles 2","Jack_C_","26 June 2018","We had low expectations going in. 99% of the time, Hollywood sequels are lazy productions that are made to cash in on the original's good will. Twenty minutes in, we happily realized that the writer/director Brad Bird actually put as much effort into this movie as he did in the original Incredibles.To echo every other reviewer- it was worth waiting 14 years. I will happily wait another 14 if the third installment is up to the caliber of #2.The animation is top notch and the script is surprisingly deep- Superheros are struggling to regain their lawful status in society. Violet is going through teenage dating pains. Family finances and stay at home parenting are heavy themes on top of the standard villain vs. Hero struggle.Still, it manages to be laugh out loud funny all the way through. Jack Jack's ability reveals are easily the funniest scenes in the movie, and we love the Poltergeist Easter egg. Wonder if Craig T Nelson had anything to do with it?Yes, the main villain is kind of weak and predictable, but that only took one star off. The story did drag at spots, as in the editor could have cut 10 minutes without losing much.Like the original, we will watch it again and again when it comes out on disc.","

But don't run away yet because that is not fun part about the movie or what movie makers were focusing on, it was the family dynamics, role reversals and yes the much anticipated Jack Jack the Big bang in the small pack and all his wonderful powers which wreck havoc and yes make him most powerful member of the team.

One of the few movies that I have watched over, and over, and over. A straight forward and simple story that emphasized love, family, and good conquering evil. One protagonist and a very clear plot line. Who didn't get choked up when Syndrome sends rockets that destroy the plane the Helen and the kids are coming on to save their dad ""mayday may day, there are children on board!"" And the way they all came together as a team - so wonderful. Incredibles II is just too busy and goes off in too many directions. Too many new (repugnant and uninteresting) characters. I watched it through once and have tried on three occasions to re-watch it. I am probably selling it short and will enjoy it in the future, but that is my opinion at the moment.","

Actually I am not a hater of comedy, but too many jokes or too much humor just slow down the pace and distract/shatter the main plot. Comedy may be a good form for cash grab, which is exactly what Disney is looking for, but is not definitely suitable for all films and should be properly controlled.","

I don't know if it is because of too many cooks or what, but this movie is one huge mess, plus an editing issue (the memory wipe is in the wrong place). No resolution with the first villain. No demonstrated resolution for the main story. The Bob-with-the-kids stuff was too much of beating a dead horse. A couple of dozen supers that do nothing. The entire script should have been set on fire. To have to wait for fourteen years and end up with this is very annoying. To be fair, I viewed it and was disappointed. I waited eight months and viewed it a second time and just plain I hated it. After this, I doubt we'll see an Incredibles 3. What a way to ruin what could have been a great franchise.","

Pops is stuck at home being the mother to the three rugrats especially the baby, Jack - Jack who as we see as the film drags on has these incredible (oh, you see what I did here?!) powers i.e. breathing fire & spewing out laser beams from his eyes (best scene involves Jack Jack and a pissed off racoon) - whilst elastic mom tries to save the city from a villain who leaves his victims in a trance; the film bounces back and forth to the father teaching his kids life lessons then wham! back to the scene of the crime that being 'elastic mom' trying to save a monorail from flying off the tracks.

"Incredibles 2","Quinoa1984","25 June 2018","Yes, it lacks the gigantic heart of the first movie (or the rather adult conflict within the family unit; here, Bob kinda feels like 'damn Im emasculated by my wife' for a scene and a half, but then thats dropped because Super-Baby, who is never not funny and steals the show in a fight with a raccoon, takes center stage in the sub-plot), but so what? Brad Bird is 5 for 6 (and even the weakest one is still pretty good), and shows why he's one of the vital comedy/action filmmakers around. I also dug how for a few scenes this kind of turned into hypnosis-laden V for Vendetta for kids (when it is already a bit like Fantastic Four meets Watchmen for kids).I kept wondering who the voice of Eleanor was; when I saw in the credits it's Catherine Keener, it suddenly makes sense why the character for the first two thirds of the movie moves exactly like Keener does. I also found there's a point Elastigirl and Eleanor have a conversation about gender roles and it suddenly occurred to me, ""wait... This is happening in *this* movie? Will anyone point to this movie being woke as a heart attack?","

"Incredibles 2","Rectangular_businessman","23 September 2020","Honestly? I think this sequel was fine. Maybe the wait was way too long, but personally, this didn't disappoint my expectations. It was fun and clever, maybe not as impressive as the original, but it was a pretty decent follow-up.I just hope I don't have to wait another 14 years for a third part. That is just simply too much, and there are already too many Cars sequels and spin-offs, so maybe Pixar can give some more love to The Incredibles now, right?","

"Incredibles 2","Floated2","24 September 2019","The original Incredibles movie released in 2004 was fresh, exciting and uniquely different from other animated films at the time. Of course now with this sequel being 14 years later, the animation is just as great if not better but the overall film isn't as good and entertaining. Having not remembering too much detail about the original film was remember enjoying it and thinking it was special, this film is a letdown.Not as great action, humor isn't as good and the plot is somewhat bland and has too much of a focus of Elastigrl being the major focus instead of the entire family. Also it is entirely predictable and the basic setup has been done many times before. It was very obvious from the beginning that it was a setup and that either Winston or Evelyn (or both) we're simply using Elestigirl, and that they were the villains. As it turned out it was only Evelyn.The baby having a unique set of powers was a nice touch but that camera little late. Although this film isn't that long (less than 1hr 50mins excluding end credits) it feels as if it drags on.Overall, for a highly anticipated film to have waited 14 years to be released, it was disappointing. The studios waited too long. Given the huge box office success, we hope the third film won't be as long to be released.","

"Incredibles 2","davispittman","25 June 2018","I am a big fan of the first incredibles film, one of my favorite animated features. It was very well made, and many of the good things they did in the first film is in this one too. I loved the chemistry between all the characters... the same great chemistry from the first. The actors all did great jobs with the voicing of the characters. Helen Parr/Elastagirl really shines here, she is the main focal point throughout the majority of the film, and I was glad she was because its so entertaining to see Helen kick butt, and it was fun to see Bob/mr incredible have to stay home and try his best alone with the kids. Being alone with them proves very hard, especially when Jack Jack starts experimenting with his powers... Which leads to some very funny moments. The villain was voiced well (Catherine Keener), this is a spoiler but honestly I could who the villain was early on... I think Evelyn was a pretty good villain, not the best I've seen but still pretty good. The first incredibles is nearly impossible to live up to completely... and this sequel doesn't but its still a really good film and a worthy sequel. 8/10 for Incredibles 2.","

The people who hated it were likely very young for the first one, and no sequel would make them happy. They're just wrong: if only for the B stories, it's fantastic.","

"Incredibles 2","benjamincallinicos","19 November 2018","While Pixar may have been slipping up in recent years with films like the Good Dinosaur and Brave, this sequel felt so fresh and they only reused two jokes from the original film. I had a great time watching it and the family was just perfect from start to finish with Frozone along for the ride.I loved all the moments where Bob has to look after the kids as that was so relate-able and really made you understand how parenthood works. Finding out that Jack-Jack had powers was really hilarious to watch and watching Edna Mode bond with him really took the cake.The whole villain while really tightly woven in, was not so good. The villain was really cleverly revealed but I could see it coming a mile off. It was a bit predictable, it's something that we've seen a million times before.But once again, this sequel was passable thanks to the really funny dynamic between the whole family we've grown to love. Was it worth the wait? I don't really know but it's hard to hate it.","

"Incredibles 2","trw-98462","22 June 2018","Having grown up in the 2000s and being an advid fan of animation and superheroes, I'd be lying if I told you that I wasn't entranced by Disney Pixar's Incredibles from 2004. Fast forward fourteen years and I found myself sitting in a movie theatre with a bunch of other twenty year olds excitedly waiting to watch its sequel. But was Incredibles 2 able to reach the high bar set by its predecessor?I'd personally say yes. This movie was an incredible success!I just love how Incredibles is able to expertly mix superhero action with the struggles faced by your average family. When they're not fighting crime, the members of the Parr family find themselves dealing with basic human predicaments, like trying to raise a baby and figuring out how to do math homework. These two genres may not seem compatible on paper, but Incredibles is just able to make it work. This results in Incredibles being a truly unique feature.Of course originality alone isn't enough to make a film great, especially if the writers are unable to compose a comprehensible story for their film. Thankfully, the plot of Incredibles 2 was able to exceed the basic fundamental requirements of storytelling, especially for a superhero film. Yes, the plot is somewhat predictable and it is honestly quite simplistic at its core. Nonetheless, the story is executed quite well, and there are relatively no plot holes present in the movie. Although the story is fine, what I found to be a major highlight of the film would definitely be the characters, specifically the protagonists.Each of the main characters added their own little flair to the movie. Helen takes the spotlight for a decent portion of the film, and viewers got to see her awesome crime fighting abilities as Elastigirl. Violet was pretty amazing in this movie. She went through development as a person, as a superhero, and had some pretty hilarious moments like when she squirted water out of her nose. Dash also showed some character growth in the film and he ended up being an enjoyable presence. When it comes to Bob, I do wish that the creators would have showed off his prowess as Mr. Incredible a bit more in the film. But since he got some enjoyable scenes as a stressed dad trying to take care of his children and was the primary focus of the first movie, it didn't bother me too much.The biggest surprise for me ended up being how great I found the Jack-Jack scenes to be. I couldn't believe how entertained I was by the antics of a baby in a movie, and he actually wound up being one of the most memorable parts of the film for me. Returning characters like Frozone and Edna maintained their charm from the previous movie, and some of the new characters ended up being pretty decent as well.I simply can't finish this review without talking about the breathtaking aesthetics of the film. The animators really outdid themselves with the movie's technical aspects. Expressions, movements, and scenery were impressively well animated, and the visuals have set a new standard for animated movies. Of course, this is to be expected. The creators did have a solid fourteen years to make this film as spectacular as possible you know.Overall, I was genuinely satisfied with Incredibles 2. It maintained the quality of the first film and even surpassed it in some aspects. Pixar did a lot of things right with this movie. And if you're unsure of whether or not to watch it because ""it's for kids,"" I would wholeheartedly recommend giving this movie a shot. I doubt that you'll be dissapointed by it. It is a pretty incredible movie after all.","

"Incredibles 2","corpse_man","20 June 2018","First of all, this movie is nothing but a giant piece of propaganda. I was a huge fan of the original Incredibles, and it's quite sad to see this new film reduced to nothing more than a means to push radical neo feminist ideologies.To summarize the plot, it's basically about how Elastigirl is a more competent superhero than Mr Incredible, and so she gets chosen to be the face of the new superhero resurgence, while Mr incredible stays at home and looks after the kids. Not surprisingly, the movie emphasizes how poorly Mr incredible is at handling his new duties at home. The main message of this movie is that Elastigirl is just as good or better than Mr Incredible at superhero work, while Mr Incredible is vastly inferior at taking care of the kids and home life in general. So basically, he is just all around inferior to her. Or let's just say it out loud, Men are inferior to women. That is the real message of the film. Ironically, it was actually released right before FATHERS DAY!!!Now if so many other movies were not packed with the same sort of blatant propaganda recently, I could probably just right it off as part of the plot, or just originality or whatever, but since almost every big budget movie recently is so full of similar plot lines, it's quite clear what it really is. PROPAGANDA.In the original Incredibles movie, Elastigirl and Mr Incredible were equals. They both had strengths and weaknesses, and in the end she ended up saving him. I loved that movie. It was about a loving family and about equal partnership. This new movie however, Mr Incredible and Elastigirl are not even close to being equals. he is completely incompetent and demasculinized, while she is vastly superior at pretty much everything. AS I stated previously, this fits in with the modern trend of movies, which seems to not only put Women in postions of power (which is great) but also seems to greatly emphasize their superiority over men. This needs to stop. Especially on a movie released just before fathers day. Like seriously?WE are basically telling our children they don't need fathers and don't need to listen to their fathers or respect them, because they are just completely incompetent, second rate people. I would NOT let my children watch this movie!","

"Incredibles 2","rustydalek-37911","28 September 2021","When Bob relives the glory days, it's bad. When Helen relives the glory days, it's good. When Bob stays home to parent the kids, he sucks at it. When Helen stays home to parent the kids, she excels at it. That's basically the narrative that unfolds from watching both Incredible films together.The plot of this is sequel is a tired, inferior rehash of the first one. Superheroes are still illegal (in spite of the fact that the original film implied they were accepted again by the end). Somebody invites Helen to relive the glory days, and agrees, which is odd after her reaction to Bob doing so in the first film. When she does, she discovers a new villain, and spoiler alert! The villain is actually one of the people she is working for. There's a bunch of antics on the side, and then a boring battle on a yacht with a bunch of poorly animated ""new superheroes"" who do NOT fit the aesthetic of the film at all. All in all, the sequel does nothing well, and brings nothing to the table. It's basically just the first film all over again, except with a female syndrome and a male mirage (being the Deavor siblings), and Mrs. Incredible reliving the glory days instead of her husband. I'm not going to sit here and claim this is some kind of overt ""feminist propaganda"". I don't know what the intention was, but there seems to be a theme of Mr. Incredible being a failure at everything, so take that as you will. What I will say that this film is a victim of lazy and uninspired storytelling, and Pixar can do better.","

"Incredibles 2","Prismark10","25 April 2019","Incredibles 2 has taken themes from films like X-Men. What do you do with people who have special powers? As well as movies like Hancock. What do you do when superheroes cause destruction in the city? Incredibles 2 also adds a feminist bent.The films starts with the Incredibles fighting a supervillain that causes major damage to the city. The villain gets away and superheroes still remain banned.The Parr family are without a job and put up in a motel until they can figure things out.Help comes from Winston Deavor, head of Devtech. He loves superheroes and along with his inventive sister, Evelyn they have a plan to remarket superheroes and make them acceptable.They want Elastigirl to be the focus as she causes less financial damage. This leaves Mr Incredible as the house husband and he discovers that baby Jack-Jack has incredible super powers as well.The story is not too deep, if you have seen other Pixar films, you could maybe guess the ultimate villain. It does have lots of action packed fun, frenetic animation and children will certainly enjoy it.","

"Incredibles 2","Maz-hell","3 July 2018","I watched the first movie around 10 years ago. It was a very good movie: The animation was incredible for the time, the story was pretty deep and complex, the universe was explained, the action was amazing and the characters were defined. It was a very good experience and I actually recomend it.The second one is... just that. The second one. Let's put the good first, because I know your finger is already twitching in the ""this is not useful"" button: The animation is flawless. It is extremely detailed, even physically acurate. And the action scenes are good: Whole action with no thinking required. The music and sound design are solid, if not simplistic until the credits roll and you actually hear the theme song for Frozone (You rule man).Speaking of thinking... The plot is really bad. Painfully lazy. It goes into Nazis at the center of the earth territory. It is so painfully predictable that you only require 15 minutes to predict the (not at all surprising) villain, its completely flawed logic and reasoning and even the final sequence. Also its plan is so incredibly dumb it falls into irony when it fails because of how much effort it used on making it fail: It helps the good guys, it gives them the means to defeating it and even gives them enough time for them to save the world. It was pointless.The humor is ""Jack jack is a baby doing baby things but with superpowers. Laugh."" It fails unless you have the brain capacity of a 6 years old. Or you have a very simple sense of humor, and I mean simple. As in ""somebody got hurt or almost. Laugh."" Also called the ""early youtube syndrome"".Also they tried to develop a baby as a character... why?. You have a teenager that has teenager problems, with no development on her character. Or an arc. Violet is actually better defined in the first film! She was a shy teenager, learning how to interact, learning to love her family, learning to control herself and to be responsible. Here she is just there... being the deus ex machina. Dash is just there too, not being even a good deus ex machina, unless activating remotely a car and causing property damage counts as it. Mr Incredible is just being there, not learning anything and failing to evolve, only lies at himself and others to cover up his errors and to learn nothing. I can't reinforce that point enough: he learns nothing.Elastigirl is just an independent woman that needs no man... wait a minute... no no no no... don't you dare... Yes, you did. You broke your own movie universe disney. You did it. You transformed a fully alive family where everyone had an arc, everyone was learning and everyone can progress and everyone is learning into a joke where only the mother and the baby are important. Good job.The morale is... pffft... keep dreaming. The first one teached you that everyone in your family is important even if you can't always tolerate each other. This one teaches nothing. It is completely devoid of meaning.Pointless.Also important: The first film actually has a heart: It makes you feel emotions, excitement, the characters actually try to resolve problems, they can interact with a natural pace. You are actually afraid for their lives when necesary. It actually warms your heart. This one can't. It is just pointless joke after pointless scene about pointlessness.In short: An empty premise kills a 14 years old masterpiece. Stay with the original.This is only a full-action animated soul-less cashgrab.","

"Incredibles 2","Quantom-X","3 October 2018","It's been a long wait. 14 years since the first film and at long last we get the continuation of the story. This movie picks up right where the first one left off. Supers are back in the light and the public opinion is mixed as always with the law not taking too kindly to the Incredibles' efforts.
Honestly with how the movie goes, I can see that their really wasn't much else they could do with the story or where to take it and it still feel like Incredibles and carry the same spirit as the first film. It could easily have just become just another super hero movie with the family stopping some big threat or some other. They went deeper with this story and kept the similar tone of the first, and it works wonderfully. It may be more of nostalgia talking, but the first film still seems to hold up better. Then again I've only seen the sequel once in theaters so far. I was not disappointed and think the movie was wonderful.
Just hopefully we won't have to wait another 14 years for part 3... if we ever get a part 3.Also. Whats up with the girl Evelyn looking almost identical to Roxanne in Megamind?","

"Incredibles 2","littlemankazoo","15 June 2018","Let me spin you a bit of a Greek tragedy here; Coming back to a world and characters I loved 14 years ago when I saw the original at my 8th birthday party, only to discover something terrible.I'm not going to sugarcoat it: Incredibles 2 was IMMENSELY disappointing.Even as I sat in the middle of a dark theater, filled to the brim with people who were laughing and enjoying a film that seemed to turn so many nostalgia dials in the room...I just could not join them in letting my nostalgia glasses take control.Because, in the end, with nostalgia put aside, this is a HEAVILY flawed film, and considering it's something of this magnitude, I simply can't let that slide.So, with that said, let's slip our Nostalgia Goggles OFF for a moment, and let's begin...shall we?'Incredibles 2' has been hyped for lord knows how long, as it is perhaps one of the few worlds that Pixar (And Brad Bird as well) created that had something to build-upon and create something new and different with a second installment. Unlike films like 'Cars 2' or 'Monsters University', a sequel truly felt necessary in a world where the market has become so saturated with superhero films. With all that considered, it seemed like a no-brainer that another Incredibles film could work in this current landscape and provide a new outlook on the genre of superhero films, just as the original film did back in 2004.Only problem is, I think they forgot to write a new film.My main gripe with 'Incredibles 2' is just how recycled and empty the entire experience feels. The film, without any self-awareness or irony about it, essentially carbon copies most of the plot-threads from the original film, only switching it up to provide parallels to the original. While this could have worked if executed cleverly, we instead receive these same plot points, played-out by different characters, but lacking most of the depth the first film.The film intends to use Helen as the main character this time, which initially intrigued me in that it was an interesting twist on the original to give Elastigirl the main action/conflict and giving Bob the family struggle after we saw his story told in the original. Instead, however, we get a Helen sub-plot that feels so half-baked and without any depth to it, it truly might as well have just been pulled from the film and we would not have lost much.None of the conflict of the original film is present. The themes of family and the struggles that come with being that are so surface level it borders on the cliche in some respects. Helen is given NOTHING to be her own character in this, and instead is given action scenes to play-out and a sub-plot that only serves to remind me how much better the first film was. Rather than giving us a great and in-depth character plot for Helen, we get something so weak and honestly regressive for how hard this film brandishes itself to be a feminist advocate that I would dare say it's offensive how shallow Helen's character arc and story comes off in this.Bob's story arc doesn't fare much better. The concept of flipping the script and giving him the family to run and learning how to be a proper father on his own is an interesting way to parallel the first film and the story it gave him...but instead, we are only given small glimpses at the depth this story can provide.Instead, make way for funny comic relief Jack-Jack scenes! Watch him fight a cartoon raccoon for 5 minutes! Watch everyone try to take care of the baby for 5 minutes! Funny poop joke! Funny baby sound!Hopefully, you're beginning to see my point. This film, for all its attempts to TRY and prove it has depth and a reason to exist, lacks all the depth of the first film and lacks a reason to truly exist.I found myself asking, at some point in the theater, ""Why does this film NEED to exist?"". Why did this story need to be told? What does this story tell us that the first one couldn't?I think the answer is simply this; this film exists because it was going to make money.This film feels so unnecessary in the thick of things. After 14 years, you mean to tell me you cannot do anything better than copying the plot of the first film, then writing a screenplay that lacks any of the depth from the original? You can't give us a compelling, introspective story about Helen dealing with being an extremely famous superhero AND a mother? You can't give us a deep story regarding Bob balancing being a father and his wish to be a superhero again? You can't give us ANY reason to invest emotionally into this film?That, quite frankly, is frustrating beyond belief.Not everything is bad in this film, much as I am deriding it. In fact, there IS a lot of fantastic stuff in this. The animation looks spectacular in every scene, the action scenes are actually tremendous to watch and were the few times I had my eyes glued to the screen, and the brass-y and jazz-y score by Michael Giacchino is just as excellent as the first film's. Indeed, there ARE great things in this film.However...if you're going to make us wait 14 years to do something new with this endlessly-interesting world you built, you need to do something NEW and INTERESTING with a sequel like this. Not copy the first film, attempt weak commentary that has already been done better in other media, and expect us not to notice otherwise.I'm tremendously disappointed in Brad Bird. I'm tremendously disappointed with Pixar. But most of all, I'm tremendously disappointed with 'Incredibles 2'.But hey...at least we still have the first film, right?","

"Incredibles 2","bj-bijaya","28 June 2018","Let's get straight to the point. I don't need to write SPOILERS here, simply because Incredibles 2 is exactly like its predecessor - The Incredibles.The Incredibles is still my favorite film. But with so much of anticipation and expectation, watching the second edition made me feel just that, ""I was watching The Incredibles again!""The Incredibles starts off after Mr. Incredible wrecks the city. Same thing in II. The family has to go under hinding. Same thing in II. Someone has to take up being a superhero again. Same thing in II. One parent is caught up with parenting. Same thing in II.

Bigger eminent threats arrive and everyone joins hand to become the Incredibles. Same thing in II. The villain is destroyed by his own stupidity. Same thing in II. The daughter finally gets the guy. Same thing in II.Director / Writer Brad Bird took a genius step over a span of more than a decade to come up with a story that could well become the second part. He Xerox'ed the first film, hoping that young minds would not realize. But what he did not expect is that there are REAL Incredibles fans out there, and they do remember every scene, every dialogue of the film. Wrong move, Mr. Bird.And yes, the action sequences are way less in this IInd version. One more star taken away just for considering the fans dumb.","

"Incredibles 2","vinniec-53536","14 March 2019","'Incredibles 2' picks up right where it's predecessor, 'The Incredibles' left off, with the titular heroes, the Parr family, thrust into an exciting new adventure. The plot focuses on Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl, with the help of millionaire businessman Winston Deavor and his sister Evelyn, trying to make superheroes legal again, while Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, stays home with the kids. When a new villain emerges with a dangerous plan to turn the general populace against Supers, the Incredibles, along with family-friend Frozone, must band together to stop the rogue. I found it humorous how Bob and Helen's roles are reversed from the first film, but it's refreshing and it works. I found the story very compelling, with the perfect combination of action, mystery, suspense, and humor. Unfortunately, the film's antagonist, The Screenslaver, isn't as compelling as the first film's villain, Syndrome. Screenslaver's identity is kept hidden for most of the film, with clues here and there to keep you guessing. Ultimately, it's not too difficult to figure out who is under the mask, but it's still an interesting mystery. Most of the cast from 'The Incredibles' returns for the sequel, and once again do a stellar job. The animation has greatly improved from the first film, with the characters and scenery looking better and more realistic than ever. One aspect of this film I especially enjoyed is that we see more of the Parr family working together to take down the bad guy, with even the kids, Dash and Violet, helping to save the day. The film's standout character is without a doubt the Parr family's youngest member, Jack-Jack, who is a delight to watch and steals every scene he is in. Overall, 'Incredibles 2' is pure fun and enjoyment from beginning to end, and I actually enjoyed it more than the first. Much like 'The Incredibles', the film's ending leaves the door open for another installment, and I immensely hope we get to see 'Incredibles 3' one day, because I can't get enough of this 'Super' family.My Rating: 9.5/10","

"Incredibles 2","CriticalOfEverything","28 July 2018","Whilst I didn't expect it to top the original, I can safely say that Incredibles 2 is a little bit below, but in terms of enjoyment I'd say it's about on par.The story sort of follows the same structure of the original, but still has enough new ideas to make it stand out as different.The writing is funnier than the original, hell sometimes it's outrageously funny. But it's still pretty dark at points like the original, so you don't have to worry if you think The Incredibles has been dumbed down to a full on comedy.There's a lot more action than the original, which is a good thing because it IS a superhero movie, but it isn't completely filled to the brim with ongoing action so there's time for actual storytelling and plot progression.The animation is absolutely fantastic. It's stunningly detailed, expressive and stylish. Just like the first Incredibles, actually, except the fact that Incredibles 2 is obviously going to look grander than it's predecessor from 14 years ago.The characters are still great and they haven't changed a bit, all of them are just as lovable as before. But the new villain, Screenslaver, is quite a disappointment. Screenslaver's a decent villain, but when compared to Syndrome there's a clear step down. Plus, the twist for who Screenslaver is is very predictable and I could see it coming a mile away.The soundtrack is fantastic, it's great to hear the Incredibles theme again after so long and it's used in different styles to match the scene now. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I thought that because modern Pixar is a bit of a mess that I'd get a cash grab but it instead I got a well made and excellent movie that deserves the 2 in it's title. I will just address the whole feminism thing people say it's promoting. YES, there's a slight feminist message that you can only see if you really dig deep for it. But unlike that of the new Star Wars movies, it isn't shoved down your throat and is more ''equal treatment'' than ''kill all the white men'' so stop saying it's propaganda, coming from a male by the way.","

"Incredibles 2","Clank_Zoka","15 July 2018","Many people were waiting for a sequel to one of the best animated animated films of all time from Pixar, I still like the first Incredibles to this day, it's funny, thought provoking, relatable, action packed, has great characters, stylish animation that has hasn't aged badly at all and Brad Bird takes a simple premise and plot but made it bigger and relatable and that's what I like about his work like the Iron Giant, Ratatouille and the first Incredibles, so the Incredibles was a child good favourite and I still remember watching it when I was young, one of Pixar's and Brad Bird's best I've seen.So when I heard the sequel was getting released this year, I was really pumped and ready to see the Parr family back in action and trailers certainly helped, now that it finally came on Friday the 13th (least it's wasn't bad luck) in the UK and I got a chance to see it the day after it got released and....... not surprisingly I love it!, it's a little better then the first one honestly, so how did it improve?.Well the plot about Helen Parr or Elastagirl (Holly Hunter) taking Bob or Mr. Incredible's (Craig T. Nelson) role from the first film which is she is been given a oppertunity to bring superheroes to not only help the rest of the Parr family but also try and make superheroes legal again, while Bob takes Helen's role from the first movie which is to look after the kids, Dash, Violet and Jack-Jack while Helen is out to do secret hero work and try and take down a new villain Screenslaver before he hypnotises everyone in the city, so it may be slightly formulaic and predicable, but it sure did a great job of doing the best it can, throughout the whole thing I was hooked on what going on, the plot is executed smoothly and the two plots with Helen and Bob connect quite well with each other, everyone actually has a part to play instead of being there, the movie still has it's great humour and there are some memorable moments of humour that evolves Jack-Jack, there's a subplot with Violet that is having a problem with her date and that got interesting since she's my favourite character in the film series, however as brilliant, clever and well executed the writing is, the movie still has great heart, especially with Bob and Violet, but sometimes it just plays it for laughs instead of taking it seriously which does kind of ruin what makes the Parr family relatable, especially at the restaurants scene which didn't really help, that and the reveal of who Screenslaver is which may not be who you expect but at that reveal moment, it becomes slightly predictable, but those are nitpicks, the movie still has originality, good heart, great laughs, it's actually more adult then kid friendly like the first movie, you care about these characters and it gets more interesting and it all comes together nicely.The animation is a massive upgrade from the first movie, the animation in the first movie did look great back in the day and it hasn't aged badly or anything, but it's starting to look not quite as brilliant as it was in 2004, however I still like it, but this animation has improved a lot, the movie looks more colourful, each character's design may look the same from the first movie but here it has a nice upgrade to them, The Parrs looks so much better, the backgrounds and the city looks more down to earth, when not using their powers, the characters has a smooth but slightly cartoon movement, but it's mostly down-to-earth, the action scenes are very creative and fast, when Jack-Jack or the rest of the Parr family use their powers it actually looks really cool, although if you get seizures from flashing images, i don't recommend this movie though because the villain Screenslaver has TVs that he uses to control his victims and in a fight that has TVs with lots of flashing images, so yeah that can be debatable, but besides that the animation is massively improved from the first movie and it looks fantastic!.The characters are still entertaining and memorable as they were back in 2004, even the new ones has a lot to offer, the Parr family is still great, Helen is a well developed character who gets even more screen time and her plot gets very interesting, Bob still has his funny moments and is still a likeable father, Dash might be annoying to some but I found him entertaining enough, but Jack-Jack and Violet stand out for me, Jack-Jack brings some great laughs with his different powers and Violet is one I found interesting and I did care about her the most besides the Parrs, Lucius Best a.k.a Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is still awesome, the new characters are also great, well mostly, Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) is charmingly and delightful character who I like all the way through same with his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener) although he remind me of Sterling from Cars 3 at times but I still liked his presences, the other superheroes like Voyd, Brick, Reflux, He-Lectrix are basically just other heroes but they do play a part like i said before, the villain Screenslaver had potential to be a great villain but came out as disappointing, the reveal of who the Screenslaver is can come off as predictable and the villain's plan did start off interesting but then it made no sense and Buddy Pine is so much better, but how can I forget Edna Mode voiced by the director himself Brad Bird, she still is really fascinating, funny and very entertaining when it comes to her and Jack-Jack, but at-least the voice acting is still amazing, Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson return and they are still great as they were before, the new ones like Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk, Sophia Bush, Jonathan Banks and many more do a fantastic job as well, but even with a weak villain, these characters old and new are still loveable and wonderful just how they should be.So maybe not quite as well crafted and important as the first film, but it still has what made the first movie amazing, it has an engaging and original plot, the animation is fantastic as always, loveable characters with great voice acting, really good humour with great heart and amazing action, this is high recommendation, if you love Pixar, the Incredibles or superheroes, please do go check this one out, along with Deadpool 2, this is one of the funniest superhero films of this year, I can't wait to see what Brad Bird makes next.Of course I'm going to give Incredibles 2 a 10/10!.","

"Incredibles 2","bornbranded","17 June 2018","This movie is getting so many effusive critic and fan reviews, of which I did not know until after I saw it. I was hoping, after logging onto my IMDB account, to see a bunch of concurring negative opinions that could have made me say 'You should have looked at IMDB, before seeing this turkey.' What I see, instead, is shocking. I must say the same thing about Isle of Dogs - I don't know how you people like that (or this) film.  Best part of the night out, for seeing I2, was this Asian themed animated short that comes before the main showing of Incredibles 2. Incredibles 2, itself, lacked a good story, the twist could be seen coming a million miles away, and it had absolutely no irony or complexity to the characters. Characters were all one-dimensional, stereotypical and uninteresting.As someone who enjoyed the original, I am disgusted with how much praise and money a third rate film like this has garnered, when so many other films have merited much more attention than this piece of crap.","

"Incredibles 2","Neptune165","18 October 2019","Fun, but stupid writing. i was so disappointed, i watched the first movie just to compare and it definitely isn't better than the first one. I felt like I was always waiting for the main story to begin but it seemed like it never did and felt cliche. This movie was really bad in my opinion. love the characters, love the animation, the plot sucks & doesn't make much sense considering the first film. if u watch the first than the second you will be like ""wait what? why r they complaining about supers being illegal??"" the first film already fleshed out that idea, yet this movie pretends as if it didn't. In about the first hour i lost interest i just didn't care anymore the first one was classic and waited to long to make a 2nd. Not gonna lie i felt they went a little to hard on the feminist stuff. AND I SUPPORT LEAD FEMALE ROLES. In the first one bob leaves and does what he has to do but in the movie the women comes and saves him. See? The first movie was perfect. However in this one bob suffers with the kids. Kinda like oh idk the implication that a man can't do it like a woman can. Kinda sucks but I hope the 3rd one can fix and kinda ""battle of the sexes"" bs however cool that bob kept It together. just let me enjoy an animated movie about superheroes without throwing that feminist stuff in my face every 2 seconds. If I watch superheroes I want to see them having adventures, that's the point. if I wanted to see ""family problems"" ""parents taking care of the kids"" and all that.","

"Incredibles 2","iquine","3 June 2022","What an animated movie should be like. Makes excellent use of the medium. This time around, super heroes are still illegal but a wealthy guy wants to change the perception of them to help them help society while also putting less burden on the insurance companies. So he decides to use Elastic Girl to kickstart positive PR. Leading Mr. Incredible to become a Mr. Mom type figure and all the hijinks around that add much humor. To top it off, now baby Jack-Jack's super powers being to emerge at unexpected times. Will Jack-Jack be a new helping hand to stop Screenslaver and his evil mind control plan? As with the first one, lots of good fun with an abundance of entertaining situations; action and humor. Top notch animation as well.","

Everyone does their stuff perfectly well, but laughs are few and far between and it just doesn't quite live up to its promise. Shame.","

"Incredibles 2","admin-16582","23 July 2018","This movie is not about family like the first one!Having a strong female lead is great, but emphasizing their superiority over men, over and over, joke after joke, just made this movie unbearable. That is not equality!The first Incredibles movie brought the entire family together as a whole and was solid, one of my all time favorites. Even though the Incredibles 2 started off good and it was funny (at first) with how Mr Incredible had a hard time with the kids, it never ended. As the movie goes on and on you soon realize what's happening because it's not subtle. The boys can't play because their masculinity is too destructive, so Elastigirl has to go solo to restore their image, but she's really just being tricked by an even smarter female who has an idiot for a brother (he just happens to be the President of a huge telcom company). Violet's character is developed as she matures and is beginning to understand the world as well as her powers. But, Mr Incredible and Dash are just kinda punching bags to make fun of and serve no other purpose. Other than us seeing all the powers Jack Jack has, he really doesn't do anything either other than cause problems. Sure near the end the whole family sort of gets involved, but they're mostly just taking turns running after Jack Jack. The movie really should have been called ""Elastigirl and Friends"".To sum it up, the story was boring and predictable. They had a certain direction to follow with the feminist agenda and the writers probably did the best they could. But if you think I'm crazy, even the film's producer Nicole Paradis Grindle confirmed that its feminist premise was years in the making. This movie taught my daughters that family only gets in the way, masculinity is dangerous, men are stupid, and women are victims. It's worth noting that my first review was declined by the IMDb staff using a general ""does not meet guidelines"" reason, which simply means that person doesn't agree with me and chose to censor my review. This is my opinion and view of the movie, and your bias should not be used to censor your opposition to further promote your agenda.","

"Incredibles 2","ironhorse_iv","21 July 2018","Following the success of 2004's Pixar Animation Studio's computer-animated superhero film 'The Incredibles', Walt Disney Pictures really wanted a sequel. However, writer & director, Brad Bird held off development to do other films. It wasn't until his last movie, 2015's 'Tomorrowland', bomb at theaters, that he returned to the project, in order to make the producers happy, while also try to salvage what left of his career. Because of that, I don't think, personally, Bird had the same heart & desirer for this, like he had, during the original. After all, it kinda shows in this film's script. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the story is pretty much a rethread, just with more poorly done foreshadowing and callbacks. Instead of Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr (Voiced by Craig Nelson) being recruited by a private company to do superhero work. This time, it's his wife, Helen/Elastigirl (Voiced by Holly Hunter) being chosen to, and now, Bob is the one, stuck at home, stressing out, while taking care of the kids. The only few differences comes from the overall tone. The first movie's is a little more fun & unique, as it portray superheroes in an bright, gratuitous 1960s spy genre adventure style, while the sequel takes the more murky atmospheric neo noir pulp detective mixed with 'Body Snatchers' horror approach to the main story. Because of that, the movie's vibrant, retro mid-century designs are not that endearingly nor as beautiful to look at, like the original. Thus, making the movie, a bit misty. Parts of the movie, was even hard to watch for some audiences, as the strobe lights used in the villain fight scenes cause them to suffer epilepsy. As for the rest of the action. While, less violent & fewer body count than the first movie, it was entertaining, but it lacks the overall family dynamics for a film called 'Incredibles 2'. They barely team up in this film. It's sad, because the climactic battle of the original, made them seem like they would fight crime together, regardless, what laws may say, and what challenges may come. Yet, the sequel drawn out, unnecessary excuses for the family, not to. It's highly annoying, because, the kids at this point, are very knowledgeable with their powers, when face with danger. As for the struggles of them, living in a 'herd morality' society. It's not that fresh nor does it make any sense worth continuing in the context of the last movie. That clash of beliefs has already been tackle greatly with the Übermensch through man-made technology VS Natural God-Given Abilities storyline from the original. It didn't need to be, recycled yet, again with a similar, yet predictable new villain. Nevertheless, I kinda dig the smart cautionary tale of allowing the perception of media to supplanted reality & dictated control of our lives for good, or for wicked means. That part of the main story was somewhat captivating to watch. Too bad, it wasn't explore to its fullest, due to the many interferes from producers. Just think, how much more powerful, the film could had been, if they went with the original idea; superheroes vs computer AI. The same can be said, if they kept the baby storyline as the main plot. The idea of uncontrollable somewhat powerful toddler wrecking society with his body horror could had been very fascinating. Sadly, instead, the movie choose to moves around, way too much with too many mini different subplots. Thus, making the sequel, a little unfocused, badly paced, & muddled. Not only that, but also full of jarring plot-holes, bigger than the school on Saturday debate and the Elastigirl hypoxia question. After all, one of the hardest things to believe, in the movie, is that the family doesn't know, about the baby's powers within the three months, timespan, they spent together in a cramped motel. I can go with the idea that the villain from the last movie, not killing all the superheroes, due to them, not being well-known, but the idea that the family doesn't see the baby's abilities really did take me out of the movie. Nevertheless, the story, is a lot better than non-canon 2005's video game 'Rise of the Underminer', but not unique enough to outdo the 2009 non-canon comic adaptation of the first film. It was bit lackluster in creative in that sense. As for the jokes. It was a mixed bag. Some of them, flew over my head, such as the 'New Math' sequence. Being a millennial, I didn't get it, but most of the others jokes, were funny. The only one that I had a problem with, is the joke with the baby fighting the raccoon. It's not like the animal was stealing, anything of value. It was just searching for crumbs to eat in the trash. That sequence make the baby, look like a total psychopath. Despite that, the animation overall for the movie was pretty damn good. Since, Pixar no longer, used the same computer systems from the original. They had to create everything from scratch. Because of that, we got more crisp, vibrant and detailed effects. It really does look amazing. With the exception of a few performers, most of the original voice actors and actresses returned to their respective characters. This is a bit impressive given how long the production gap was. Not only that, but they were all great in their roles. As for the newcomers, they were alright. However, nobody from that field was really that memorable. As for the music; composer, Michael Giacchino's jazzy score for this movie was just as good as the first film. The nostalgic tunes were catchy to listen to. Overall: In the end, ""Incredibles 2' still turn out to be, somewhat great; even if it doesn't match the majesty of other Pixar sequels. Still, I think a lot of people will enjoy this film. It delivers as much of the joy, pathos, and adventure as the original. It's worth the price of admission. It's super, too.","

"Incredibles 2","CANpatbuck3664","22 June 2018","The animation in the original was great but this movie took it another leap forward. Having seen the original so many times, it took me a bit to adjust to it, but the movie never ceased to beautiful or have something imaginative. The attention to detail is insane (Bird has a reputation for being nitpicky, so much so that the animators of the original partially modelled the character Syndrome after him) and there was never a moment was I wasn't impressed or even blown away by how stunning this movie was. Adding on top of that, I would stack the action scenes in this movie up against any modern superhero blockbuster. They are thrilling, and I would even say astounding. My favourite was the runaway train scene. I hate to keep playing the same note, but I think the visual style in Incredibles 2 is as impressive if not more than any animated movie I've seen in the past couple of years. I also understand the worry about triggering epilepsy because one of the fights features a lot of flashing lights. I thought it was a sensational scene but the warning is warranted.Moving from the animation to the characters, Bird and his team do a good job developing the familiar and introducing the new. Instead of Bob/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) being the main character, the focus shifts to Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter). I was worried when I saw the trailer, not because Helen was the hero, she's a great character and my trepidation was never about the story having a feminist slant. But the husband not being able to handle the family duties is a tired thing, it's been done over and over and this movie calling attention to it seemed counterproductive. Is anyone offended by a stay-at-home dad? It was a temporary arrangement and I feel like we've gotten past that being weird. Anyway, Elastigirl is a great hero and her narrative was compelling. I liked how she bounced off of her new corporate backers Winston Deaver (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deavor (Catherine Keener) and while those character play to the actor's strengths (Winston isn't Saul Goodman but he's not too far off), they had plenty of personality. I'll talk more about Bob later, but I also liked how Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Dash (Huck Milner) hugged the line between having issues yet not being too bratty. Violet is pretty moody throughout the course of the movie, but they give her a nice moment near the end that compensates. Luscius/Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is a funny returning character but he drifts in and out of the movie, I would have liked him to have more screen time. Everyone's favourite characters are back in Edna Mode (Brad Bird) and Jack-Jack. Jack-Jack was a riot and I loved almost every second we got to spend with him. Edna stole the show in the original and while she doesn't get more screen time, her appearance is pitch perfect. They go with the less is more plan with her and she's just as effective as Bob's suit designer/confidant. 
Looking back on the trailer, a lot of the more annoying moments actually ended up being some of the better bits of the movie. Bob trying to handle Jack-Jack's endlessly varied power set was hilarious and although the movie centres around Elastigirl, the war on the home front occupied my attention completely. I still did find some minor problems however. Incredibles 2 shows off Helen's abilities superbly and she capably anchors the film. But on the downside, I thought the movie betrayed Bob's abilities as a superhero. He defeated a robot in the original that killed dozens of other heroes, yet he can't handle someone who has never tested their abilities in the field? I approve that the movie put Mr. and Mrs. Incredible on more equal footing (I'm also good with Helen being the more professional hero which is what Incredibles 2 seems to insinuate) but they didn't have to bring Bob down to build up Helen. I wish we had gotten more opportunities to see the family fight together as a team. As the trailer shows, the family each has their moments but rarely as a group. It doesn't detract from the action but the fight scenes with the group together were wonderful in the original and I wanted more of that. I would also comment that a lot of the subtext is going to fly over a younger kid's head. Its nice that they include adult friendly banter about complex issues, all the best family movies can appeal both to adults and kids. But I doubt kids are going to understand much of the debate that fuels the villain's motivations. I watched the original entry before going to see this and it only inflated high expectations. The Incredibles is a masterpiece and it should be regarded as one of the best superhero movies ever made. This movie had a lot to live up to and despite some minor stumbles, I think Incredibles 2 comes close. It boasts some phenomenal action, the animation is top notch and while some of the story elements were better handled then others, I still left the theatre impressed. At worst, I took a couple of small issues with the progression of some of the characters, which is a relatively minor complaint. If you've been waiting for another adventure with the Incredibles, I think you're going to be pleased. Pixar makes phenomenal movies when they're firing on all cylinders and this movie is no exception. I highly recommend this to fans of the original and newcomers alike.","

"Incredibles 2","pjgs200","23 June 2018","Incredibles 2 was a great movie. The characters were all written wonderfully, it's genuinely funny and loads of fun to watch, and it's a satisfying sequel to the 2004 film that brought joy to the whole family. While watching this film, there were moments where I actually said ""this is awesome"" while watching the film. It's just so great to see these superheroes back in action after 14 years, and it's funny and exciting throughout. I loved seeing the whole family trying to resolve issues while fighting crime.I do think that the villain in the film was both underdeveloped and pretty easy to spot. From the first time we meet her and her brother, we know something's up, so it wasn't a surprise that one of them was the bad guy. I also think that the scene where Elastigirl is in that electric cage was a bit of a mistake on the part of the animators and the directors. Although I don't have epilepsy, it was still uncomfortable to watch, and that scene makes it harder for those who do have epilepsy to enjoy the film. Overall, Incredibles 2 was a really fun and satisfying movie. 8 out of 10","

"Incredibles 2","Jared_Andrews","19 June 2018","Fourteen years after the original, writer/director Brad Bird returns to helm the second installment of The Incredibles. The movie landscape has changed greatly since then. Many moviegoers may not realize that The Incredibles came out four years before Iron-Man, which launched the ""Marvel MCU."" So, for any fans who love superhero movies, don't just thank Robert Downey Jr. for kicking things off. Thank Brad Bird. For fans who are tired of the oversaturation of superhero movies, still thank Brad Bird because The Incredibles is a truly wonderful film.The sequel doesn't quite reach the lofty standard of the original, which would have been nearly impossible, what with the originality and seminal nature of film, the characters and the exceptional villain. But Incredibles 2 does boast improvements to the visuals. I advise you to sit relatively close and take a good look at the detail of every scene. The lighting, the color, the movement-it's all immaculate. In a visual sense, this movie is a marvelous achievement. The weakest aspect of the movie is the villain. The villain is obvious, predictable and unclear in his or her ideology. I get the sense that all the necessary pieces were there, but the filmmakers couldn't quite put together the puzzle. Fear not, the villain's shortcomings are certainly not enough to spoil the movie. It has the appropriate blend of action, thoughtful commentary for the adults and silly jokes for the kids. I opted not to mention the plot at all because I thought, ""why bother?"" The Incredibles have to stop a villain, and they also deal with other issues. Great, you get it. Now go see this movie.","

"Incredibles 2","highmarksreviews","12 July 2018","The Incredibles 2 has finally arrived and after a long wait does what few sequels can and probably should. It lives to the hype in the best of ways possible. Worth noting is that this movie might just be one of Pixar's most visually stunning and vibrantly animated pieces yet and that just adds extra atmosphere. The cast is terrific, with welcome returns from fan favourites giving solid performances to the franchise's fully realised characters. The story is simple, yet interesting and has several side elements that are incorporated very well. The idea of a larger superhero world and their legality is discussed with a narrative that is surprisingly mature and conscious of the message it wants to convey. The action and overall spectacle is beautiful and creative, even if its not as large-scale or grand as the first one. I will say though, Incredibles 2 has gorgeous scenery, an awesome cast and a great story, but it has a villain problem. ScreenSlaver isn't really connected to the world in any meaningful way and ends up being a one-off baddie with only a few memorable moments. But, in the end, the movie is still a win, and manages to tie up loose ends from the first and open up new doors for possible new instalments, which I honestly hope are yet to come.
 
The good: Visual design and clean animation, Performances from the cast, Good story that tied into the original, Great new characters as well as recurring older ones, Creative and vibrant action sequencesThe bad: Main villain is a little off and forgettable, Some characters may feel a little under-utilised at times","

I have a number of issues with it, but let's get into the first one.Tone: Not every film in a series/sequence needs to maintain consistent tone, I get that. But the first film has always stood out from other animated movies, because of its serious tone and mature themes (children and adults can enjoy it). This movie feels like a different franchise entirely. It lacks all the high stakes, emotion, and seriousness of the first film. Consider just a couple moments from the first film: the plane crash scene, the scene where Mr. Incredible threatens to kill Mirage, the scene where Buddy gives his ""it's bigger, it's badder"" monologue, the scene where Mr. Incredible realizes his fellow supers are dead and is then absorbed by black slime, or when Elastigirl considers that Mr. Incredible might be having an affair when she finds a white hair. Any one of these scenes is more complex, emotional, and interesting than the entire Incredibles 2 film. The second movie lacks any sense of stakes or seriousness. It felt like the most dumbed down version imaginable. The first film was so smart in its approach and dialogue, and the characters felt realistic and intelligent (the fight between Elastigirl and Bob when he comes home late). This film has lost all of that completely. For example, the scene where Elastigirl is talking to the sister and says ""are you asking the believer or the cynic?"" was possibly the most cringe-worthy, out of place dialogue I've ever heard. Like they were trying to intellectualize a moment so hard it just felt forced. Even the color scheme of this movie felt jarringly different and so saturated, like the colors were turned up to the max. The first film had a color story that made sense: it's grey and depressing when Bob is working, explosion of color once you get to Nomanasan. There's a development of color that is both metaphoric and makes sense. This film's color story felt childish, which would be fine if it was just a children's movie. But it's apart of a franchise that's first film was an iconic masterpiece with mature yet fun themes, and in that respect it is seriously disappointing and difficult to watch.Plot: Most predictable plot ever made. As soon as you see it, you know the siblings (sister) will turn out to be bad, and that she's controlling screen slaver. And of course Elastigirl finally gets her turn to save the world and Mr. Incredible + family will have to go save her (a reversal of the first movie that at first seems creative then becomes almost too predictable). And I have major issues with the villain. They are literally fighting people who can be calmed down if they just remove goggles. Characters: What happened with the characters? They were all dumbed down versions of themselves. Even that scene with Dash where he can't pronounce decimals, which was supposed to be family friendly and cute, was just irritating and felt dumb for his character. Elastigirl was over the top to the point where she didn't feel like herself. Bob was the... same? I guess, but had zero development. Violet, who I get is going through her angsty teen thing, is okay. Even the minor characters, Edna aside who was fine, like the guy who helps them relocate each year was off. In the first film I appreciated his seriousness and matter of fact style, which appeared cold but you could tell he actually cared. Even he felt crazy different. It actually hurts me to continue critiquing this film, so I'll stop there despite the many other issues I had with it.","

"Incredibles 2","DawnOfCreation","21 June 2018","I just watched The Incredibles Marathon. I didn't like part 1 en part 2 was just as bad. I didn't like the humor, didn't like the story and in general dislike the way they made this animation movie. They try to turn a normal action movie script into an animation movie. That's not what's animation is about! Animation goes beyond the realm of possibilities. It just doesn't feel good. It's too boring for me, visually not impressive, and overall mediocre. When you look at animations like Tangled, or Toy Story or Frozen you get pulled away from reality right into this wonderful world of magical animation. The incredibles pt. 2 is the exact opposite!Maybe there are people on this planet who like this kind of animation, but it's definitely not for me! And I'm a hardcore animation fan. Watch the trailer and decide if you like what your seeing, if you don't, save your money!","

"Incredibles 2","writers_reign","31 July 2018","Apart from vintage Disney - Snow White, Bambi - I tend not to watch animation but I was struck by the way several critics in National newspapers lauded this title and laboured the point that it was as entertaining for adults as it was for children, if not more so. On that basis I gave it a whirl. Not having watched the first title I had no idea of who was who, if there were any recurring villains etc.
I didn't even know that - like Superman - they were only part-time super heroes, a typical suburban family who, in times of trouble, are able to assume powere beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. There seemed to be some mileage in a storyline that had the matriarch saving the world whilst the patriarch stayed home and played house husband. I can't say that I was moved to dash out in search of other Pixar titles but I did watch to the end.","

"Incredibles 2","domsimmonds","14 October 2018","After 14 years of waiting, Brad Bird finally made a sequel to his marvellous film...the Incredibles! And it did not disappoint. Although not as good as the original in my opinion, it was a great pixar addition. They keep finding new ways of making meaningful, inventive and entertaining content, appealing to both Kids and Adults. It doesn't treat the audience as children and that's what's great about it. The quality of the production is amazing as well. It follows directly from the first one and expands on issue mention in the first one, which are then addressed! Overall, great film, certainly one of the better films of the year.","

"Incredibles 2","AustinOswald","12 June 2018","Incredibles 2 was smart, action packed, visually stunning, and HILARIOUS! It's everything you expect from a Pixar movie minus the tears. Actually, scratch that. The nostalgia and the genuinely funny moments will make you cry of pure joy. I personally loved seeing these lovable characters fight their way through super villain mayhem on once again. Incredibles 2 takes place right where the original left off, so expect to jump right into the action. Some of these action scenes were so flawless and exciting that I could've sworn they were taken straight from a Marvel or DC movie. However, Pixar still managed to create original action sequences by using the Parr family's abilities in many creative and innovative new ways. The animation, lighting, and surface texturing was also something to marvel at. From the individual strands of Dash's hair to the wrinkles on Mr. Incredible's clothes, this movie was a detailed filled masterpiece. When using the word ""masterpiece,"" I must also mention Michael Giacchino's brilliant score. The Incredibles theme was brought back for this film and used in so many exciting new ways. You can tell Giacchino loved experimenting with this powerful score that he wrote over a decade ago. Be prepared for many laugh out loud moments in this movie as well. Jack Jack will melt you heart in one moment and make whatever you're drinking come out of your nose in the next moment. He really does steal the show. From a nostalgic stand point, this film did not disappoint. It hit all of the marks of a successful movie sequel and as a Pixar Fan, I couldn't be happier. All in all, this movie is a blast and will probably be amongst the top 5 movies of the summer. It DEFINITELY lives up to the original and some might even say it's better.","

"Incredibles 2","ferguson-6","13 June 2018","Greetings again from the darkness. In 2004 THE INCREDIBLES became the 6th Pixar film in a row to dominate the box office, and also the 6th straight to ""WOW"" us with a combination of animation, story, action and characters. All these years later, Brad Bird, the creative force behind the original, is back with the much anticipated sequel. Mr. Bird's career over those years has featured a blend of other animation (RATATOUILLE, 2007) and live-action (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL). Bird is not the only returnee for the sequel. Also back is the entire Parr Family: Holly Hunter as Elastigirl/Helen/Mom, Craig T Nelson as Mr. Incredible/Bob/Dad, Sarah Vowell as Violet, Huck Milner as Dash, and Eli Fucile as baby Jack Jack. The story picks up not long after the original ended. ""Supers"" have been outlawed, and the Parrs are in some type of Super Protection Program - similar to Witness Protection. Of course when one is a superhero, doing the right thing just comes naturally, and the opening scene finds them battling their old nemesis Underminer (voiced by Pixar good luck charm John Ratzenberger, who voices a character in each of the studio's films). Our heroes stop the crime, but cause significant damage to the city. This leads to our first social commentary when the powers that be scold the Parrs and inform them that the banks have insurance, and it's cheaper to let the criminals get away so that the damage is minimized. As superheroes non-grata, the Parrs try to go ""straight"" and live a normal life. That is until a powerful brother and sister corporate duo offer a proposal. Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deavor (twist that pronunciation just a bit, voiced by Catherine Keener) want to generate a PR plan to help rebuild the reputation of supers. The idea is to make Elastigirl the public face of the program by having her wear a body cam to show off her heroic deeds (in this age of 'pics or it didn't happen'). She's chosen over Mr. Incredible for economic reasons, and he's relegated to stay-at-home parent (or as we called Michael Keaton in 1983, MR. MOM - an unacceptable sexist term these days).
Elastigirl enjoys her time in the limelight, while Bob doesn't much like being just Bob. Plus he can't understand why they changed math, as he gets frustrated trying to help Dash with his homework. He's also challenged with Violet's teen angst over a boy, and even moreso over the discovery that Jack Jack has POWERS! In fact, Jack Jack has multiple powers, but as a baby, he has little control - though his battle with a raccoon is not a segment you'll soon forget. Also returning is Frozone - voiced by Samuel L. Jackson (minus his trademark ""MF'er), and costume designer Edna Mode - voiced by director Bird. Other new voices include (Odenkirk's fellow ""Better Call Saul"" castmate) Jonathan Banks as Rick Dicker, Isabella Rossellini as the Ambassador, and Sophia Bush as Voyd, one of the new generation supers (which includes Reflux - one you'll just have to experience). The big new villain causing problems for Elastigirl is ScreenSlaver, who hypnotizes large groups of people through their screens - more social commentary on our dependence on technology and the addiction/affliction we have toward device screens. The flood of superhero movies over the years since THE INCREDIBLES exposes the not-so-complex story in this one, but it's terrific that the film keeps much of the original look and feel, and yet brings something new ... baby Jack Jack is a star!Filled with the beautiful colors and art design we've come to take for granted from Pixar, the film also features some of the best action sequences you'll see in any movie. The train sequence with Elastigirl is simply spectacular - as is the final action sequence. It's also nice to see the flip in gender roles as Mom (Holly Hunter) takes the lead. Michael Giacchino returns as the composer and he blends in a touch of James Bond theme with his wonderful work. If the film needed extra credit (which it doesn't), certainly the inclusion of a ""Jonny Quest"" clip would qualify. Family films don't get much better than this, and even though it runs 2 hours, the closing credits feature the theme song for each of the superheroes, and could easily have been a short film unto itself.Speaking of short films, a Pixar tradition is to include one before new releases. This time it's BAO, a Chinese mother/son and food-oriented story from director Domee Shi (animator on INSIDE OUT)","

"Incredibles 2","Neptune165","20 October 2019","This movie was too long plus bad timing i fell asleep I just didn't care anymore unlike the first i loved it and cared so well too predictable. They took everything that was awesome about the first incredibles & dumbed it down. I legit knew the entire plot a half hour in the movie. Was so obvious the villain was going to be who it was. Sure the animation was good but that can only take the movie so far. To me this seemed like a dumbed down kids movie where as the first one was an epic adventure for all ages. It was boring and dash was really annoying it feels like they played more cliches in this movie. Had its moments with elastergirl having the spotlight she was just boring and could of made a more Interesting. whatever happened to the underminer? did he escape? he was such a big deal in the first movie. The new heroes like voyd? She is so annoying they're horrible looking they're not fun or funny to watch is just a bunch of big dumb dumbs and ugly designs wow. does anyone even remember their names? they were used pretty badly. now... the villain... Oh! the lamest villain of them all oh my!!! there was no master mind behind anything she didn't plan the plan of the century like they tried to make us believe. Heroes are illegal, she makes them legal so that she can make them illegal again ... wh... what? she gave up her plan by allowing heroes into her space in the first place she really isn't the smartest. It was terrible the movie didn't focus on any character","

"Incredibles 2","bob the moo","9 March 2019","I still remember watching the first Incredibles film and liking it for what it was, rather than what it had been marketed as. I liked its darkness, and how much of the character and plotting seemed aimed at someone much, much older than the marketing had suggested. By contrast, Incredibles 2 seems much more interested in keeping things light and fun. This makes it a slightly 'lesser' film in terms of the detail and observational elements but does make it easy viewing. The plot sort of follows a journey for Mrs Incredible, but it doesn't really build it so much as use it - likewise any emotional knock-on for the other characters is the same. In terms of what plot it uses to get with this, it is obvious enough in terms of twists and direction, but it does the job.That job is producing plenty of enjoyable action and funny moments, and does so for most viewers of most ages. The lack of darkness helps this slickness, and the 1960's vision of the future design adds to the sense of fun with its nostalgic references and look. The voice cast are all solid, even if several of them are essentially doing what they are famous for (Jackson, Odenkirk). As a whole there is much to enjoy in terms of spectacle and laughs, but it doesn't run much deeper than that, making it a lesser film, but probably one good enough that you'll not feel the impact of that till you reflect back on it.","

"Incredibles 2","Semisonic","12 March 2019","It is a clear sunny day boding nothing bad, and then suddenly a random guy bursts in on a giant drilling machine, robs a bank and literally sucks it dry, making off to an undetermined direction with his prize.I can't help thinking that this is the best way to describe what Incredibles 2 did to its paying audience. I haven't paid a penny to see this film, but even I felt robbed, of my time, my hope for having a good taste in cinema, and - most importantly - my good memory of the first Incredibles.It's been 15 years since the first film had been released, but instead of going forward the sequel seems to have gone back in time, to the fantasy 60's that only existed in the James Bond movies. The super family, however, had frozen in time and looks almost the same, but those real life years have indeed taken its toll - in the form of Holly Hunter's voice, which now sounds as if Elastigirl is an elderly lady not yet accustomed to her new dentures. And that is just the first of many more stark contrasts between look and feel Incredibles 2 aren't able to hide.Another thing that deteriorated just as bad as Elastigirl's voice is the filmmakers' ability to distinguish quality and hollow filler. I don't remember all the details of the first film, it's been quite a while indeed, but I do remember that, despite intentionally goofy graphics, it felt real enough in terms of sincerity. That super family acted in a way that made you care, and the plot was a balance between keeping it reasonable and providing enough surprise factor.This time, however, we get a clumsy mix of hollow action scenes, generic parent-child moments, really forced promotion of gender equality and a dystopian anti-brainwashing message more fitting the bleak Blade Runner universe instead of the colorful tech-happy retrofuture. Watching the kids do kid stuff is now more tiring than cute, and the little family quarrels from amusing become ridiculous. Just like the new villain's persona and motive.Overall, Incredibles 2 made me realize once again that some things aren't meant to be remade or continued. Especially if you can't add anything new or fresh to what's been said and done earlier. And if you're not that good with creativity anymore, at least let your heroes grow up a bit. Because seeing kids not ageing a day in fifteen years makes one feel like John Nash from A Beautiful Mind, and that proved to be not the most healthy thing.","

"Incredibles 2","b2280545","18 July 2018","The Incredibles return in the highly anticipated sequel that fans have waited for 14 long years to arrive in theaters. The first Incredibles released in 2004 was a masterpiece of filmmaking for it's time and is part of Pixar Animation Studios's Golden Age of films along with past iconic titles Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo. What these films have in common is how they were able to touch the hearts of audiences across the world, as a result becoming cult classics. In the past, Pixar has produced sequels to their films from time to time, with the Toy Story franchise being the most popular and with the next sequel Toy Story 4 scheduled for a 2019 release, the franchise continues it's success. Cars and Finding Nemo both have had relatively decent sequels but this one was highly desired for the last fourteen years. That being said, there hasn't been nor will there ever be a case when a sequel to an adored iconic film is released that audiences especially fans of the original who hold it dear to their hearts will not perceive the sequel at first glance as inferior to the original. That can damage a film's reputation. Incredibles 2 does look different (the animation literally looks different) and yet is similar to the first film with a new twist. It's habit of bringing back the nostalgia that made the original loved is it's biggest strength. The film picks up right where the first film ended with the first superhero family facing off with the villain the Underminer giving viewers the idea of the kind of film their about to watch. One thing this film does well is develop each character's powers to new levels. For an animated film, the action sequences are thrilling, sometimes heart pounding and super fun to view. The music is similar to how it was before giving exciting 60's spy movie vibes. The best moments of the film are the ones where Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible is watching over his children while his wife is away saving the world, something we did not see in the first film was his relationship with his children. The theme of wanting acceptance in a world that hates you is back, a relatable subject in today's world for some people, and just as in the first film, it's presented well. Incredibles 2 is an enjoyable action packed superhero fest with a coming of age aspect to it. All the characters are under pressure by the world around them that's telling them how they're supposed to live their lives creating sadness and desperation for them. As time goes by, they must choose what they want to be. Pixar has always included deep emotional topics like this in their films all to their credit. Finally while the additional characters new to the film may not have been the most memorable Pixar has invented, it had an interesting story, entertaining action, a final act that pays off, humorous moments and seeing the characters return made the film worth the wait. It doesn't completely live up to the original though nonetheless it is a worthy sequel to one of the most successful animated films in history.","

"Incredibles 2","iguth","7 May 2019","Incredibles 2 is a sequel too late. Of course it will be hard to make a sequel that lives up to the original and they didn't quite overcome that challenge. The movie picks up right where the first left off but it seems as if the previous movie didn't happen. Character growth from the previous film is pretty much not there and the Tony bit throughout the film is awkward. The humor is lost on me, I don't find much of it funny but maybe some do. The graphics, upgraded clearly to stay competitive in today's market, but it differs so far from the original that it feels out of place. I enjoy the twist of seeing Helen doing the work and getting to see Bob bond with his kids while supporting his wife. Edna is just as good and the suit rundown is just like before (which is a good thing). The big problems with this movie come from the new characters, villain, and climax. First the new heroes look very weird; they look inhuman. Winston Deaver is the only charming newly introduced character to me. The villain is not good. Dull, predictable, and trying to fulfill a poorly thought out plan are all ways I'd describe the villain. Finally the climax of the film. Why is there a hydrofoil? There is not reason for there to be a hydrofoil. Overall I have some huge issues with the plot but the action sequences are all great and the humor probably appeals to people that aren't me.","

Nelson) and mom Helen (Holly Hunter) are performing their heroic deeds as their super-hero alter-egos Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, along with their kids Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Dashiell (Huck Milner), as well as baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile.) But their activities are still illegal, and their exploits have caused yet another public calamity. All seems lost, until millionaire Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk), launches a campaign to make superheroes legal again, along with his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener.) But a mysterious villain called The Screen-slaver plunges The Incredibles, and their cohort Frozone (Samuel L Jackson) into a battle where no one is who they appear to be...We seem to be under attack from a barrage of sequels lately, some to fairly recent films and others to films from a while back that never got their follow up when they were flavour of the month, such as this sequel to the animated 2004 superhero satire The Incredibles. That said, they will only ever make sequels to films that were in any way a success, and so the comparatively lukewarm fanfare this sequel received was telling in itself. I certainly took my time going to see it, even after being very impressed with the first one, not least because I didn't relish sitting in an auditorium on my own packed with noisy, screaming kids. So, of course, I went to see it yesterday on a Bank Holiday Monday, thinking it wouldn't be so bad because it had been out a while and the showtimes were less frequent (bad luck!!!) Sadly, I wish I hadn't bothered...The animation, special effects and action sequences are, of course, as amazing and impressive as ever, and will certainly bring spark and joy to the average young person (no gender stereotyping!), who will be dazzled by all of that without thinking of anything else. But whilst older, more demanding viewers will still enjoy the in-jokes and references to modern pop culture and social issues, they will be less impressed with a far less engaging or coherent plot than the original, as well as a really obvious villain you can see from a mile off. As many others have noted, there seems to be some really obvious interference from the female empowerment lobby in the proceedings, with Mr Incredible as the 'stay at home dad', while Mrs Incredible is off saving the world like a superhero should throughout, in a reversal of how it's been throughout the years.I'm not sure why this got made, other than as a cheap and easy way to make some cash. Original director Brad Bird has doodooed all over his original masterpiece with this pointless and flat offering, that came out of nowhere like a thief in the night, with no Incredibles to stop it. **","

"Incredibles 2","DeanAmythe","25 January 2024","Brad Bird has a knack for staging action that he gets to express even more so in animation, and if any argument is to be made for superhero films to move that medium, it's this. While a definite downgrade, especially in terms of plot, from THE INCREDIBLES, the supers didn't get to interact with their powers much until the final act in that first film (which was, of course, the point, and certainly no detriment) and that happens to be where this takes off, allowing many more showcases of dynamic action. Also helps that this looks fantastic, is frequently hilarious, and Giacchino's score never fails to excite. I know superhero fatigue is a thing right now, but I certainly wouldn't mind one of these every few years.","

"Incredibles 2","bigal_a","25 April 2019","When I heard the synopsis of this film, I feared it would be going down the social justice rabbit-hole as so many other popular franchises have done.My main fear was that Elastigirl was going to shine effortlessly and Bob was going to be totally out of his depth and incompetent. And in truth, there was some of that, and a little bit of feminist by-play between Elastigirl and Evelyn.But, to be honest, I think even super-mum Helen would have had her hands full with Jack-Jack, who shines in a scene where the baby fights a racoon, emerging untouched and the animal slinking away terrified.And Bob does get to grips with his enforced home life, getting the ever-enjoyable Edna Mode to look after Jack-Jack (which she seems to enjoy), so he can get a night's sleep and get back on his feet. So he ends up effectively and clearly teaching maths to Dash before an exam, and getting lovelorn Violet back on his side. Even when Jack-Jack returns, Bob seems reinvigorated, almost reveling in his baby son's burgeoning powers.Not to say too much about the climax of the film, but suffice it to say that all the kids play their parts, as well as some new supers with bizarre powers that the Deavor siblings have gathered from around the world.And at the end, Mr Incredible, Elastigirl and Frozone end up fighting as a team, together again.I liked it, and I probably will watch it again some time.","

"Incredibles 2","Pjtaylor-96-138044","21 July 2018","'Incredibles 2 (2018)' - sans 'The', for some reason - is essentially just a worse version of the first film, with its narrative playing out so incredibly closely to that of its predecessor that beat-for-beat comparisons are almost easy. How it took Brad Bird fourteen years to come up with this is anyone's guess. Its character arcs and overall messages actually feel as though they backtrack upon the original's, only to reach the same conclusions. Both this picture and even the first (or, at least, its finale) actually seem somewhat redundant due to this. The two narratives don't really feel like they connect all that well, considering where one leaves off and the other picks up, despite them carrying directly on from one another. What I mean is, while the main plot may flow from one piece to the other, many other threads and character arcs don't come together quite as cleanly. The only real positive this picture has going for it are some genuinely exciting and, at times, suspenseful action sequences. These moments tend to flow fairly well and provide some real, if brief, entertainment. In general, though, the film feels very subpar. There are some very poor character designs. The new heroes are honestly some of the worst characters I've seen, from a visual stand-point, in some time. They are actually difficult to look at and don't fit the aesthetic at all. Pixar should be producing better original characters than this. It may just be me, but the film seems slightly over-animated, too, and loses the 'realistic' look of the first, even if it is more impressively rendered. The flick's main issue is the writing, though. It feels off from the start. Overall, the movie lacks the narrative strength to stand on its own - thanks, in no small part, to some strange plot holes, poor motivations and weak characterisations. It fails to fully capture the quality or even spirit of the flick it follows. It also has a bizarre underlying philosophy that holds its very genre (or a subsection of it) - as well as the audience that enjoys such fare, which is apparently now oversaturated and underdeveloped (a debate best saved for another time), and even the increasing demand for that fare - seemingly in contempt while also playing entirely into the worst aspects of it and becoming the very thing - in concept, execution and intent - it appears to dislike. It ends up just another entry into a fading 'fad' with nothing new to add. 'The Incredibles (2004)' certainly can't be described as this, even all these years later. It's a shame, too, because this film didn't need to be better than that original feature, just a good one in it's own right. Honestly, it doesn't do a great job at that. 5/10","

Only the last fifteen minutes or so saved this movie from crashing and burning completely.","

"Incredibles 2","fabiogaucho","27 November 2018","This review will be buried under 800+ others, but I just had to put my homage to the movie here. I lost count of how many amazing set pieces. Yes, there is little character developement, but we already know those folks. The movie puts them in new roles, and that is enough. We already know the universe they inhabit, and frankly exploring social themes would be a waste of computer power. I could get through even the overbearing feminism, but that is probably because with so much netflix, PC stuff has beaten me into submission. Also, because the elastic woman is so well used. So I ended up enjoying Mr. Incredible trying to be a stay at home dad (and relatively succeding, giving the utterly impossible circunstances). Yes, the plot is predictable, but this is kind of expected in such an action-oriented flick. Jack-Jack gives enough surprises.Incredibles 1 was good, but it dragged at times, specially in the 1st half. This one will not let you down, it really puts everything into the action scenes, and there is never less then 10 minutes between them. The chasing of the Screenslaver in the building and the Violet/Voyd fight were my favorites. Introducing new people with new powers was a smart idea, and it works better here then in the overcrowded X-Men sequels. The ending is overdone, but in the age of Marvel movies, ending battles have to be overdone, it's kind of a rule. I just took this movie like a Mission Impossible sequel: give me nonstop thrills, without being overbearing, and that is enough.","

Too much dialogue and build-up that never went anywhere, the characters were whiny, and I don't even think kids over 4 would enjoy this snooze-fest (if even then). What a waste of the past 14 years -- all that time passed and no one bothered to develop a clever or entertaining plot/script. My kiddo and I booked it immediately as the credits began to roll.

"Incredibles 2","educallejero","16 July 2019","(the better people) Smart presentation of the theme. With text and subtext. Almost everytime the movie talks about how special the superheroes are, we can replace that with the 1%.The villain of the movie shows how fake is the reasoning that the superheroes help the rest with their existence (superheroes are the 1%) and they need rules for themselves. The villain says that we (normal people) don't experience life and give up our liberties, freedom and consume the real thing from the safety of our homes, watching the screens (All true in real life, and I'm as guilty as anybody), while the 1% makes the decisions, have power and do and experience for real whatever they want. . The villain is the one that doesn't like the 1% (superheroes).While by text, the movie shows that all the superheroes (1%) want, is ""being treated fairly"". They want the rest to adapt to their exceptionalism ""for the betterment of the world"" (if nobody sees the ""don't put taxes on us and we would create jobs"", then what can I do? Because it is obvious to me).Besides that, the problem with this movie is that is boring. The lead character was Elastigirl this time. But they didn't go all the way. In the first one, we saw mr Incredible sad and depressed. So the scenes that weren't funny, had a lot of weight, which translated to the story rather well once it picked up the pace.
Here, Elastigirl doesn't have much of an arc. She was a bit indecisive at times, but, just in a few scenes, and it didn't impact the movie. The story was cliché as eff (the dad doesn't know how to do the mommy duties, while the mom was being held back by the antiquated stereotypes of having to stay home, but she's as good or better than the dad at everything).It's so.... boring. Violet's arc was so teen angs lame. Dash didn't have an arc (not even a short one) in this one. Tooooooo much focus on the baby with a gazillion of pathetic jokes (I don't think I laugh/chuckle once in the entire movie).So yeah, the animation improved and it was great, and the action was super fun. But what made the Incredibles better than the rest just wasn't there in this one.","

"Incredibles 2","bsilbor","4 July 2018","I remember watching The Incredibles back in '04 and was blown away by it. My 40-year-old father was even more excited than I was at the time. I won't fanboy over this sequel, but seeing these characters return as if there wasn't actually a fourteen year gap was a ton of fun and hilarious. I couldn't help but smile. The action scenes and the powers/technologies used in the scenes were so clever and fun and could really only be perfected in animation. Speaking of which, the animation (and this goes without saying, again given the fourteen year gap) was ten steps up from what it was in the original. Frozone's ice powers, Violet's shields, even the hair was incredibly realistic (pun 100% intended).There were a few slight things I felt could have been improved, though didn't hinder my enjoyment in any way. One is, as stated by many others, the villain. Syndrome was a personal villain going up against Mr. Incredible. A fan-turned-enemy. The Screenslaver was not personal, and their plan seemed a little convoluted and, because we only got a couple minutes of backstory, the motives felt lackluster. Their identity is also a bit predictable, as there are really only two suspects. But one other thing that was lacking, but not absent, was the depth of the characters. Bob Parr was so desparate to get back to heroics, that he totally dismissed his family. When he thought they had died, he realized what he was missing. A character arc like this was not present in this one. I will say, however, that the message the villain plays up is very topical. Waiting for superheroes to save the day is impractical and dangerous. It's up to normal, everyday people, the ""Joe Shmoes"", to fix the world if it's broken. Because in reality, there won't be a Mr. Incredible, or a Superman, or a Captain America to save the day. We are our own superheroes. We can't wait for a superhero to fix our lives...WE need to fix it ourselves.I've also noticed quite a few people claiming that the message of the film is that women are superior to men because Elastigirl got the superhero gig and Mr. Incredible was ""stripped of his masculinity"" by becoming a stay-at-home dad. No...it's just that Mr. Incredible had his time to shine in the first one, and now it's Elastigirl's turn. Disney didn't bring gender politics into the movie...you did.This was a great, but not perfect movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Hopefully it won't take another fourteen years for a third one.","

"Incredibles 2","Hellmant","15 June 2018","'INCREDIBLES 2': Four Stars (Out of Five)Pixar and Disney's long anticipated sequel to their 2004 animated superhero blockbuster 'THE INCREDIBLES'. The plot follows the Parr family once again, as they battle a new enemy, who wants to turn the public against all 'supers', while they also try to deal with normal family life as well. The film was once again written and directed by Brad Bird, and it features returning voice cast members including Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson. Huck Milner, Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk, Sophia Bush and Bill Wise also join the cast this time. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like it's predecessor), and it's also expected to be a huge hit at the Box Office once again as well. I enjoyed it, but definitely not as much as the original. The Parr family is still acting as the superhero team known as 'The Incredibles' when the authorities become too concerned about the damage being done during their battles with supervillains, and the team is ordered to halt their actions. Then they're contacted by a superhero fan named Winston Deavor (Odenkirk), and invited to his house for a proposition, along with their friend Frozone (Jackson). There Winston and his sister Evelyn (Keener) offer Helen Parr (Hunter) a superhero job fighting crime, in order to win back the support of the public. Helen accepts the job offer, and Bob Parr stays home to watch the kids while she works. Helen has to battle a new supervillain in the process, and Hank finds parenting even harder than crime fighting, especially when he learns their baby Jack-Jack has even greater superhero powers than they all do. The movie is really well made once again, and always beautiful to watch. The action scenes are mostly exciting too, and the humor is clever and witty (all once again). It's also great how progressive these films are, especially this time having the wife superhero be the one fighting crime, while the husband stays home to watch the kids. Of course he also finds parenting to be even harder than crime fighting too. That's all great about this movie, but it still didn't live up to my very high expectations of matching the original (or even coming close to it). It doesn't capture the same magic, and after the original film was so refreshing and somewhat groundbreaking at the time of it's release, there wasn't much this sequel could do to live up to it of course. It's still really well made though, and entertaining enough.","

"Incredibles 2","sktraut","23 October 2023","Alright, who thought this would be a good idea? Obviously, they did this for money because they're telling essentially the same story again. I love these characters and Brad Bird has a gift for writing and directing. These two things are the only saving graces for the movie. Besides that, I like to pretend like this doesn't exist. It's so, so silly compared to the first one. Incredibles 1 had some moments of levity, but it took itself pretty seriously and had something to say about people becoming stagnated upon settling down, not letting their gifts and passions see the light of day. This one isn't really saying much. It's trying to hard to be funny and wastes its time on Jack Jack, math homework, and pointless side characters. Honestly, they should have set this one at least a decade in the future and focused on the kids now become adults, telling a different story with different lessons. The fact that this takes place seconds after Incredibles 1 ends deflates that perfect ending. They really didn't need a sequel, honestly. It'd be like (God forbid) making a sequel to the Iron Giant or Ratatouille, two other Brad Bird movies. These movies are self-contained and pretty flawless: they don't need sequels to say anything more. ""What happened to the giant?"" and ""what happened to Remy?"" are as pointless as asking what happened to the Parr family. Use your imagination -- the story has been told.","

"Incredibles 2","MrDHWong","14 June 2018","Incredibles 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the Disney Pixar classic The Incredibles. Written and directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, Ratatouille), it is a well-made follow-up to one of Pixar's best movies and a solid superhero film in its own right.A short time after the events of the first film, the Parr family, Bob/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner), and Jack-Jack, continue to protect their city from danger while also trying to live out their lives as normal citizens. One day, Helen is recruited by an organisation called DEVTECH, who are devoted to restoring the reputation of superheroes and regaining their popularity with the public. With his wife now away working for DEVTECH, Bob is tasked with looking after the kids and tending to their needs, which proves to be much easier said than done.The film is more action-packed than its predecessor and thanks to improved animation techniques, is far more exciting at times. All of the charm and familial love of the original film still remains in this sequel and once again there was a good balance of comedy and drama. Most of the original voice cast returns, including Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as Elastigirl, and of course Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone. In the previous film, it was the character of Edna who stole show in every scene, this time, it is the adorable baby Jack-Jack who gets the most laughs every time he is on screen. The only major issue is that the villain was highly predictable with generic motives and as a result was much less clever than Syndrome was in the original. Overall, this sequel was worth the 14 year wait and hopefully there will be a third installment in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8/10","

"Incredibles 2","domdom-63818","28 October 2018","It's just full of propaganda, I enjoyed it overall but almost every 10 minutes there was something new trying to brainwash me which I appreciated very little.The ambassador or whatever it was is a woman, that's fine. They added what seems to be some sexually ambiguous folk in there as well, which is also fine. They said Elastigirl is a better superhero than Mr. Incredible, they showed how great of a mother and super hero she is. Then they showed how crap Mr. Incredible is at looking after the house and everything in life to be honest, a complete disaster in fact.At the start they had to make sure Violets boyfriend tells us how he likes powerful women 'cause he's so secure in his masculinity or whatever. Two siblings run a major company, the brains behind the operation of couse, a woman. The parents of the two siblings died, yes, you've got the hang of it now, because the father was an idiot and didn't listen to his wife. The super intelligent villain, is that same woman. These are just some of the things I remember, but one of the scenes that really bothered me was a really short clip of a TV ad where a guy was baking a cake or something and the narrator said ""so simple even HE can do it"", imagine this scene but with a woman trying to fix a computer and the narrator saying it's so simple even SHE can do it, many people would be very upset.I thought the first movie was pretty equal, each member of the family was equally valuable, they all realised they needed each other. While the super intelligent superhero might have been a guy, the super intelligent superhero suit designer Edna is a woman. It all seemed pretty well balanced. I'm just shocked the judge at the end wasn't a black woman as well to be honest.I'm all up for having women with the more significant roles in a movie but this is just an overload to the point where it's blatantly obvious they're trying to brainwash us through a screen, which reminds me a lot of the villain of the movie, peculiar... The message I took away from this is that we're best off just getting rid of men because women are perfect. I guess that's what equality means now a days.","

The extra super heroes seemed kind of generic and one dimensional, they threw too many in there and their animation seemed sub par. Violet did some cool stuff with her force fields, but Dash seemed slower, Mr Incredible not as strong but Frozone seemed to have a little stronger ice. And the plot didn't really make sense. Seems like after 14 years it could have been better, like the Finding Nemo sequel. But don't be surprised in the next Nemo movie if Marlin curses out another fish for picking on Nemo, its coming apparently with Disney.","

"Incredibles 2","mckaymalcolm","23 June 2019","Thankfully I waited until I could stream in the house, if I'd actually taken the family to the cinema I'd have been quite miffed.
Pretty poor storyline tbh, and one or two laughs - but overlong, at nearly two hours. That's fine if it's fast, funny and engaging - but it definitely missed the mark on the last two points.
My daughter had never seen the original - wish I'd sat and watched that instead, as we all know how good that is, and Incredibles2 doesn't come close.
All in all the kids will enjoy - but the adults will zone out. Hope they don't make a 3rd.","

"Incredibles 2","maurodc","16 July 2018","I was around 4 years old when 'The Incredibles' came out at the theaters, and during those times I didn't get tired of watching it over and over again. A few years later, I knew that there was going to be a sequel, but not the day or the year it was going to come out. And finally, after 14 long years, we have 'Incredibles 2'. And here's what I think.Obviously I liked the first one much more, but still, this is a really good sequel. It has moments that are exciting and completely hilarious. It's very joyful to see this characters again on the big screen, including Jack-Jack (I know you will love him). It has interesting confflicts and, I won't spoil you anything, but it's very funny to see Bob Parr's parental side.So, It may not be as epic as you'd expect it to be, but however, the excitement of the action sequences and the charm of all the characters keeps intact. Perfectly enjoyable and funny for the whole family.Thanks for reading!","

The things that stand out most are 2 CURSE WORDS! One character says ""hell"" (as in how in the hell will they pull that off?). She also says DAMN!!!!!! An animated Disney/Pixar character. As well, this same character later carries 2 brown liquids in a glass to Mrs. Parr/Elastigirl and says ""is it too early to drink?"" Seriously Disney!?!?! My kiddos and I walked out. Also, this Incredbidles is extremely dark compared to the first and seems like an animated Marvel or D.C. Comics Pixar movie. Not impressed. Not a fan. This was a let down.","

"Incredibles 2","JohnDeSando","12 June 2018","In Incredibles 2, how does writer/director Brad Bird make a family film that is adventure, thriller, and comedy? Well, he's had practice beginning with Iron Giant and Ratatouille and The Incredibles in between. With three distinct approaches to entertainment he has made a reputation of smart and fun and plain genius all over.Incredibles 2 is super family fun as the family picks up where they left off, specifically leaving a track meet and pursuing The Underminer (John Ratzenberger), who is digging under the city with a giant corkscrew. The importance of this successful sequence is that it's the first time for the family to work as a team in public.It's a regular family going through growing pains and a superhero family trying to reconcile its gifts with a society that the rules against them. That's right, super heroes have been outlawed because they're perceived as adding to the troubles. The answer lies in pursuing the law and changing it more than fighting a strange villain called The Screenslaver, who hypnotizes while you watch. Obviously, a subtheme of this multilayered allegory is the enslavement of the populace to it screens. Yet, Bird does not enslave the audience to theme, e.g., a race sequence in which Elastigirl, Helen Parr (voice of Holly Hunter), chases a hover train taken over to head to destruction is as furious a ride on a motorcycle as you have ever seen.Not all is heavy-duty: Baby Jack-Jack fights a raccoon, funny in himself, with baby showing hitherto unknown powers. The sequence is high humor using a baby as a rib-tickling comedian-hero. Add to this slapstick the light orchestration of composer Michael Giacchino and you have a sci-fi animation with soul.That's the irony of this inspired animation and real life--sometimes even the good has to fight to be recognized, or to be legitimized: ""You know it's crazy, right? To help my family, I gotta leave it. To fix the law, I gotta break it."" (Helen Parr) Incredibles 2 is primarily about bringing back heroes to the public fold and figuring out how to break the law in order to fix it.Furthermore, what's a super mom to do when duty calls and she must leave the family under the untrained care of dad, Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson). Bird doesn't make Bob a boob (although there are laughs at his expense), but rather has the rest of the family pitch in to help with major challenge, baby Jack-Jack with hitherto unknown super powers.Bird recognizes the need for dads to fit in the management of the house, for instance, as he tries to untangle a mess with daughter Violet's (Sarah Vowell) date, who discovers she's a superhero. He misses their date, and dad must do some intricate counseling of his head-strong daughter. Even for a superhero, that's a tough challenge.But the super heroism most prominent is that of Mom, as good an example of the best of #MeToo that allows a woman to be empowered publicly and fulfilled privately, with a little help from her family. One of the best films of the year and in the animation canon for all time.","

Films (especially pixar and other big companies) should strive to put more effort in rather than this bag of ok. Movies like this don't inspire or challenge anything.

"Incredibles 2","dezriknightangel","22 June 2018","At first viewing the Incredibles 2 was on par (no pun intended) with most Marvel sequels: Not deep, but visually stunning and entertaining throughout most of the film.That said...First of all, the story is weak and forgettable. The family for which the movie gets its name is hardly relevant, with Dash and Violet having no impact on the plot (and Dash failing to receive even an attempt at a subplot). Mr. Incredible fails in everything he attempts in both heroic and domestic pursuits, and Elastigirl saves a few lives before falling for an obvious trap and being controlled by the villain.As the story comes to its climax, all of the heroes (including Frozone and both parents) have been enslaved by the villain and its up to Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack to save the day. Rather than showing how young people can be just as heroic as adults, a car gets to be the hero, with their sole contribution being accidental. The film then concludes with complete victory for the heroes and an utter lack of character development. Such plots as the Underminer, the technology to erase memories, the damage lawsuits, and the villains unused ability to enslave the entire human race were ignored and forgotten.This movie was little more than an excuse for Disney to push its increasingly heavy-handed political agenda into the minds of young people. Every scene is filled with cowardly men, evil entrepreneurs, and flat jokes. The movie explicitly states that it is villainous to unplug from technology and live your life and that vicarious living through screens is ideal and that protests and law breaking is the only way to change public policy.This is not intended or writtwn ironically. This is the film's actual moral message.I'll end with this: If you enjoy the most recent Star Wars movies where beloved characters are rendered irrelevant and progressive politics are the driving force of the story you might not mind this movie. Yet in the theater with me were a lot of children who weren't laughing and a lot of parents slowly realizing that Disney is no longer family entertainment.Disney is a propaganda mill ranting against the capitalist middle-class society that supports it, and I urge you to stop supporting the films they release until their focus returns to quality filmmaking.","

However, after waiting patiently for so long for a sequel, I was a little disappointed. In the first movie, both Elastigirl and Mr Incredible used their superpowers equally, along with their children, to make up a great super team. Here Elastigirl stole the superhero limelight, with an obvious political message. Mr Incredible was portrayed as petty as he struggled with the fact that Elastigirl was picked to be the superhero while he was a stay at home dad. Regarding his superhero powers, he was utterly useless in the beginning when fighting Mole Man and in the end when fighting Screen Slaver. He couldn't even rip through a few pipes in the ship to get to the boiler room. The family didn't really gel as a superhero team like in the first movie, where the sum was greater than its parts.","

""Incredibles 2"" takes advantage of the advances in computer animation since the first film came out, and the family's adventures look snappier and super-exciting, but it is the echoes of the original (including a dynamic new score by the returning Michael Giacchino) that hook us.

"Incredibles 2","ssnake_z","21 August 2019","INCREDIBLES 2
RATING: 3.2/5Honestly, this should have been called ""ELASTIGIRL: THE MOVIE"" because she's really the main star. The rest of the Incredibles family takes a back seat to her, so much so that you barely even get to see the family suit up, much less work together as a real team. Dash suffers the most out of the family in that regard. If you're looking for character development, it's not really here outside Mr. Incredible learning how to be a stay at home dad, and even that's questionable. Frozone gets more screen time, so he's not just the token Black guy this time around. The villain is pretty meh by the end of it, and if you give their evil plan more than a passing thought, it ends up being pretty dumb and pointless overall.This film is basically a time capsule, being that it takes place pretty much right after the first Incredibles movie. After 14 years, 3 Presidents, and 10 years of Marvel Studios superhero movies, Incredibles 2 needed to be way more than just a run of the mil sequel. This may have worked when they were at the top of the superhero mountain in 2004, but they've been lapped by so many other superhero movies now that this really doesn't cut it in 2018. Add to that the fact that they're still on the whole superheroes being illegal thing, which Captain America Civil War covered much, much better, and Incredibles 2 just ends up feeling outdated.The score is pretty fantastic though. It's loud, it's bombastic, very 60s James Bond but with a superhero flair to it. The voice acting is solid with Mr. Incredible being the MVP with all the range of emotions he has to go through. The animation is great, no surprise there from Pixar. The action is pretty fast paced and serviceable, but for some reason, i just wasn't impressed by it. I really don't know how many other ways Hollywood can shoot a runaway train scene. It also didn't help that the first fight just reminded me how much of a Fantastic Four ripoff The Incredibles are too. I chuckled twice during the whole film, but my theater laughed a lot, so the jokes were clearly working on some level.One of the other issues is that there are really no clear positive male figures in the film. Mr. Incredible is relegated to a stay at home dad, and he can't even figure that out on his own. Mrs. Incredible though, she can apparently do it all. In fact, almost every female in this film is infallible, while almost every male has some character flaw or has messed something up somehow. It's really weird. Like, the movie props up the women at the expense of the men, which i think sends a bad message.If you're looking for a few laughs, action, and to go back to 2004, you'll probably have a great time with Incredibles 2. If you're looking for a good story, good villain, balanced positive male and female figures, and a superhero team that actually practices teamwork, then you should probably look elsewhere. Outside the animation, music and jokes, the movie fails on almost every other front and that's just unacceptable after 14 years. Beware the hype with this movie, cause it simply does not live up to the first Incredibles, at least not for me, not by a long shot.","

"Incredibles 2","neonadventure","16 June 2019","Summary: The film is takes place right after the first one did. They fight against the Underminer, which they did already with Mr. Incredible and Frozone in ""The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer"" (2005). But they change the ending of that game just to continue on obviously which is good because the game only has Mr. Incredible and Frozone to play as and NOTHING ELSE. Then they get in trouble for destroying a Government building and then they have to live in a motel after the aftermaths of the Underminer attacks. (kaboom) Eventually, Frozone comes and talks to Bob and Helen Parr about a guy who wants to help all three of them bring back supers into justice again.Thoughts: I was happy at first, and now I wish that the third will be stronger than this stale piece of bread. Oh sorry, did I offend you, well everyone has opinions too you know. (I didn't offend you right?) Why do I think this movie is bad, well because the movie has a bad storytelling. In a way it's like you see an intense crime fighting scene, and then you see some father having an emotional breakdown over his new math book. Well that's not the point actually, the point was that there are no major plot twists that ever shock you, you just know that, ""Ok, something doesn't feel right and then that lady who doesn't sleep just puts a mask over her head and she's like 'I'm so sorry little one.'"" And I kind of felt like this was a little weak since most of the stuff that goes in the movie kind of copies off of the other film. I really thought having that ending was just bad.Seriously, this film isn't that great as I expected. There are a few mistakes that I have noticed throughout the film and the story isn't powerful and there isn't anything new to explore. (Hey guys look at my basement, it's empty.)Although Incredibles 2 does have positive ratings from many critics, it is one of the most disappointing films for me this year when it comes to movies that came out in 2018. (NINJAGO MOVIE) The 1st film is where the Parr family deal with mediocrity as the main theme of both of the films. Well Incredibles 2 is the just a synonym for mediocrity.My dark predictions will ruin your day. There might not even be a INCREDIBLES 3 movie unless if they have a plot twist. (But it's going to be useless to add in a plot twist.) This movie is where Brad Bird is like, ""You've watched the 2nd, i'm finished.""","

"Incredibles 2","fernandoschiavi","20 May 2021","The film begins by inserting us again in that universe, where heroes are prohibited, and begins the story at the very moment when the first film ended. From now on, we can witness the appreciation of the visual of the work, which manages to capture what was already very good and make it even better. Without forgetting the somewhat caricature physical characteristics of each character, the focus was applied to improving, mainly, the textures of the objects. From the clothes, to the background, everything is very alive, making us immerse ourselves even more in history. Also noteworthy for Violet's force fields, both in terms of looks, as well as in the new skills that the young heroine developed (apparently out of nowhere).Although a passage of time was possible, similar to what happened behind the scenes, redefining all the relationships between the members of the family nucleus and, therefore, turning the dynamics existing in the sixteenth century scenario of the film, Brad Bird chooses to play in insurance, but does not make use of this facility by negligence, using it as a possibility to renew and embody the themes related to the item that really matters: the family. And this is where the work surprises us with the choice of the Elastic Woman to take on the task of returning to work, giving her the protagonist that in The Incredibles belonged to her husband - who, in turn, takes on the task of taking care of the house and children. In this sense, Bird's idea of using an endangered train as the heroine's debut mission is perfect, since a similar rescue had been part of Mr. Incredible presentation in the previous feature. At the same time, the script recognizes how women who preserve their careers after maternity end up being charged for it, having to go out of their way to avoid judgments - which results in a brief and perfect joke that brings the Elastic Woman to the phone having to help the son to find a pair of shoes while trying to save the lives of dozens of people. Yes, the film takes place in a fictional analogue from the 1960s and Brad Bird explores this, putting a pinch of the discussion of the roles of men and women in the society of the time, but nothing of the level of today.Role reversal proves to be very effective in bringing a new look to history. While Bob goes out of his way to take care of everything and prove that she is capable, Helen experiences, for the first time, what it is like to be in the center of the spotlight and escape from the family routine. This parallel is the highlight of the film, as it works very well the relationship between these duties - Edna herself questions what can be more heroic than being a father -, giving enough time for both to shine. While the Elastic Woman is stretching around the city in various action and chase scenes, saving the day, the most fun core brings Mr. Incredible needing to use all his flexibility when dealing with Violet, disillusioned after the memory of his crush been erased; with Dash, more agitated than ever; and Jack-Jack, who is increasingly developing his powers. In fact, all the scenes involving the baby Parr are very funny. As seen in The Incredibles, the super-baby has several powers (he is basically Franklin Richards, from the Fantastic Four; in fact, the parody with Marvel's first family is blatant, the Paar are as dysfunctional as), it controls none and causes numerous confusions, whether by fighting with a raccoon, giving Edna Mode a hard time, or trying to help the family save the day. The little one steals the film for himself every time he appears.And the most admirable thing is that, in addition to all these virtues and its competence as entertainment, The Incredibles 2 still finds space to include important discussions in its narrative, criticizing the way the media shapes public opinion to demonize or deify someone and refuting , almost nominally, any approach to Ayn Rand's sociopathic texts (something that, by the way, has become a point of honor for Brad Bird since some critics suggested that the writer / philosopher had influenced the original). Of course, at certain times the filmmaker only shoots certain topics in the film without worrying about expanding them, as in Violet's fleeting comment about how the rich are never really punished or even when bringing the villain Hypnotist talking about how we are prisoners of screens that surround us. In contrast, Bird is courageous in pointing out how civil disobedience is almost an obligation in the face of absurd laws and attitudes on the part of the powerful, and it is equally relevant to realize how the protagonist of female characters is instrumental in serving as proof and example of capacity and need for women to occupy more and more leadership spaces, since not only does the Elastic Woman manifest having been influenced by the Ambassador (Rossellini) but she also influences the young Voyd.Another noteworthy point in The Incredibles 2 is, of course, its production design, which uses the 1960s as a starting point for the overall look of the narrative and brushes it with futuristic elements - since the train opened by the mayor to the Woman-Elastic motorcycle. As if that were not enough, the animators add fascinating mannerisms to the design of the characters and that help to convey their feelings more efficiently: notice, for example, how Violet compresses her lips in defiance when throwing something at the shredder or the accomplice look that changes with the mother in the face of the immaturity of the men in the family. Similarly, notice how Dash's hair takes on a darker color when wet or how Mr. Incredible seems to burn when removing the waffle from the toaster and you'll see why Pixar remains the undisputed leader in its industry. The soundtrack, in charge of master Michael Giacchino again, is perfect, grand in the moments of action and subtle in the milder scenes. It is difficult to deny the energy given to the work by the composer's score, which once again creates themes with a clear influence of jazz to suggest the individuality of those characters and the charm of their world.Likewise, Bird and Pixar's team of animators devise dynamic action sequences that explore the limitless possibilities of digital when it comes to camera positions and movements, surprising the viewer both in grandiose passages (like the one that occupies most of the third act) and in others of a smaller scale (such as the fantastic confrontation between a character and a raccoon). In addition, the design of the occupants of that universe is a gift in its own right, illustrating Pixar's care for every detail - from Mr. Incredible dark circles and stubble to Winston's frowns and facial tics, which clearly refer to those of Bob Odenkirk, responsible for his voice (incidentally, one of the most entertaining details of the film resides in the character Voyd, who, despite having the voice of Sophia Bush, is wide-open a digital version of Kristen Stewart, reproducing his way of biting his lips, tilt your head, move your hair and move your eyes as you speak).Although it is not carried out so deeply in either film, the reflection is explicit that a relationship cannot be sustained if each one does only what he thinks is right or only what pleases him. So much so that - as expected - only the union of the whole family (and friends) is able to solve the problem they face. Perhaps there is the biggest problem of the sequence, because it bets on a predictable plot, both in the climax and in the outcome, but which is held in the charisma of the characters and in the efficient action scenes.However funny they may be, however, the scenes involving the Incredible Baby still sound like a narrative crutch to support the main uninspired premise, which displays several hasty resolutions, as well as the underutilization of beloved characters - the case of stylist Edna Mode, limited to a kind of special participation (fun, but short) - in addition to a very predictable turnaround, which moves the final act. And if in the technical sphere the years that separate The Incredibles 2 from its predecessor were beneficial, in terms of the market they may not have had the same effect, since the saturation of the superhero genre (including several examples based on the comic appeal) ends up taking away part of the freshness offered by the original. Taking into account the expectation created due to the waiting time, and Pixar's own history, this feeling of repetition of a formula, but lacking the ingredient of innovation, the studio's brand, is almost inevitable - as had already happened with Finding Dory (2016). Still, the combination of a visually elaborate animation, good jokes and, above all, the empathy previously established by the characters, guarantees pleasant escapist entertainment for audiences of all ages.Brad Bird knew how to measure perfectly how much to bring from the first film to reactivate the memories of fans of the work. Some speeches and gestures may even go unnoticed by the least attentive, but certainly the situations involving Edna and Lucius with his wife, will bring the nostalgic and fun feeling that was expected. Released no less than 14 years after the first film, The Incredibles 2 is one of those sequels that respect the original without feeling the obligation to basically repeat it - and, thus, I will be happy if the series comes to win new chapters, even if these take another many years. After all, one of the many advantages of animations is that your characters never need to grow old.","

"Incredibles 2","kressckerl","21 October 2018","I am gonna try not to spoil too much, at least here in the start. I think this movie had a lot more potential than was included in the package. The plot was predictable, no emotion in the villain like the prequel, and the characters were bland and boring. But it wasn't all that bad, it scored a solid 8 from me after all, I liked the part with the stay-at-home dad, though it was really funny. And the action scenes were cool and entertaining.Spoiler past this point -------------(I am bad at separating spoiler-content from non-spoiler content)As said above, the villain is super bland and extremely predictable, and as soon as the siblings invited the Super' characters, I knew something fishy was going on, thus I already had the siblings as prime suspects in my villain investigation. When Helen captures ""The Screenslaver"", I was honestly not sure if it was meant to try to fool the viewers into thinking it actually was The Screenslaver, but I thought it was dumb how Helen didn't stop to think for a second that, that could have been the case.Even tho I didn't like the plot nor the villain I still found the movie entertaining, at first when I exited the cinema I could not decide wheater the first movie or this one was best, but I can now.","

"Incredibles 2","SoumikBanerjee1996","2 July 2023","I don't know about the others, but I personally found this sequel considerably better than the original. The story shrewdly incorporated some societal issues as well as eloquently showcased the rapport between the members of the family in a more elaborated fashion and therefore paving the way for some exciting character dynamics and development.Albeit, the lack of a compelling antagonist comes back to haunt them yet again. While the events that gradually unfold made for a ride full of intrigue and thrill, lesser emphasis on the overarching storyline influenced the outcome even to a certain extent. It couldn't acquire the point of gratification it should have otherwise.","

"Incredibles 2","geno-young","26 March 2020","Seriously? I waited 16 years (I just saw it for the first time today) for this? The ONLY reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because of the animation, humor, charm and fast-paced story telling. That's it. This was nothing more than another preachy, far-left piece of feminist propaganda that fits into the virtue signaling politically correct culture that has a strangle-hold on our media and society right now. I'm all for equality, but when you shamelessly pander to a specific group of people (women) and emasculate the other group (men) just to further the social standing of the group that you feel has been marginalized (women), you totally defeat the purpose of your mission. If equality is what you are seeking, let the marginalized party gain that respect on their own merit. I believe that it does women a great disservice for these movie studios and the media to thrust them into the spotlight for the sole purpose of making them look superior. That in itself defeats the purpose. Enough with the virtue signaling from Hollywood, let women be strong side by side with men, for THAT is equality. One can not be better than the other. This movie clearly pushes an agenda, and makes men out to be mindless, bumbling buffoons while the women run the world and are the masterminds behind it all. The only male with a SHRED of common sense is Dash and THAT'S REALLY saying something! The whole premise, in fact, is that Mr. Incredible is so bumbling and heavy-handed, that Elastigirl has to hold up the torch while he stays at home with the kids; leading to disastrous results . You get it? Classic feminist role reversal.Make no mistake whatsoever, this film was a deliberate cog in the master plan of blurring the lines between what it means to be male or female. Unless you've been living under a rock for the last 4 years, it's been blatantly obvious that there is a serious war against masculinity occurring in our society right now; and this film plays on that and is nothing more than propaganda advocating for it. The film rambles on with little substance or originally and ultimately leads to nowhere. There's no climactic build up, plot twist or shocking reveals. Just a disgruntled woman at the center of it all. And that's it. Pair that with Violet's bumbling obsession with Tony, and Mr. Incredible trying to learn ""New Math"" and you've got the whole film in a nutshell. I didn't wait darn near 20 years for this! The film is entertaining and the characters are likable, but the subliminal and often OBVIOUS messages and themes throughout make this film such a disappointment. The original appealed to EVERYONE, but this one clearly is geared towards a certain group. There are moments in the film when you don't know if you're watching ""The Incredibles"" or ""The Princess Diaries!"" Yes, the feminist undertones are just THAT loud and clear. I know in our current political climate EVERYONE is a 5¢ advocate/activist but this is just pathetic. You can't even escape in a CHILDREN'S movie! Get back to making classics Disney, and leave the politics to the experts. A disappointment.","

I hate it when projects geared for children use profanity. There was absolutely no reason for it. It actually felt like a slap in the face to parents. Second let down...making Mr. Incredible a complete idiot for 90% of the movie. I am ok with giving Elastigirl the spotlight since Mr. Incredible had his time in the first movie. I am ok with him being a stay at home dad. The fact that this movie depicts him as an idiot incapable of raising his own children, and pretty much a boob, was just a little too PC for me. Third...the intentional use and mention of alcohol by Elastigirl and the villain. I am not opposed to alcohol, but I have a hard time with it presented like an enticing advertisement in a kids film. The director went out of his way to add the profanity and use of alcohol to this film. Disney has become a huge let down for me.","

"Incredibles 2","mohammedalawami-10948","11 February 2021","Honestly, some of these reviews pain me. I guess a movie that has a female lead and villain is immediately a femenist movie and I guess if it's not as good as the original, it's a disappointment and an awful movie and looking at the hateful reviews, it seems to be people who waited 14 years for this movie that are hating it. Gosh, people these days are so hard to please.Going away from the annoying haters, this is one excellent Pixar sequel. It's not as perfect as the original but that movie is so perfect in every way it's hard to beat it and honestly, I think this movie beats the original in a couple of ways. Obviously, the animation is gorgeous and probably the best from a cinematic point of view. Brad Bird is a genius. Each scene has magnificent lightning and each surface and body part is polished so beauifullly. It truly is a work of art. That 14 year break really helpes the animation team to refine the animation.I also think Violet and Jack Jack are much better characters. Jack Jack steals the movie with so many funny moments and awesome sequences and it's awesome seeing a super baby, something that was teased at the end of the first film and it's expanded on brilliantly. Violet as well is much more likeable. More confident and more able to stand up to herself and ask a boy out. She's also another character that steals the movie with so many hilarious moments and goes through a great character arc, reconciling with Tony and becoming a responsible teen hero, putting the needs of her family and the world over herself.Bob as well is taken in the perfect direction. At the end of the first film, he apologizes to his family for being a lousy and selfish father and swores to do better and here, he takes the responsibility and I appreciate how this film takes it seriously and shows fatherhood is no easy task and as the film progresses, he tries and tries but constantly gets held back in one way or another but by the end, he becomes a suitable parent.Onto the main plot. This film definitely takes the story in a perfect direction, commencing with the Undermine fight and reinforces an issue in the first movie with superheroes being illegal and now they need to resolve that issue. A perfect concept for a sequel and leads to pretty adult dialogue scenes about people's perception on heroes and why they're seen like that. Elastigirl provides to be an amazing protagonist who is likeable and kicks ass in so many amazing sequences. Frankly, I don't get why people complain about her being the protagonist. Bob is the reason why superheroes became illegal in the first place so logic dictates Elastigirl should take the responsibility.The action scenes are so amazing in the movie and we get to see different heroes. Each action scene feels incredibly different and utilizes the character's powers perfectly whether you have the undermine fight, the motorcycle chase scene, the helicopter rescue scene, a battle on a cruise ship, a hosue battle and some hand-to-hand combat. They're fast-paced and beautifully animated.In terms of the villain, I actually kind of like Screenslaver. I really like her beliefs about superhoees as well as her ideology and you really get where she's coming from and I can't lie. Screenslaver is really intimidating and has great motivations.In terms of why this film is not a 10/10, I felt Dash got sidelined and didn't have much to do and didn't have any standout action scenes. I also felt like Evelyn's plan did not make much sense. I guess it plays out pretty coherently but it's overcomplicated. I felt like the final battle as well was a bit rushed and it just didn't feel as fresh or as mature as the first. There was something special about the Incredibles, focusing much more on the adults rather than the kids, making it feel more adult. This was more focused on the kids and a whole family, which is not an issue but a bit of a shame after the first movie. Regardless, Incredibles 2 is an incredible sequel to the first that doesn't deserve the hate.","

"Incredibles 2","patboldt","27 June 2018","Going into this movie I expected to see a film that just outright sucked. Too much time had passed, the voice actors had to change, the hype was going to be too great and there was no way it would please expectations which would be way too demanding. Then, when I heard this film was really good I thought that people might be overreacting and just saying it's great when really it wasn't. This is how I thought, this is how I was trained to think. Well? They're damn right! This film was awesome! It was on par with the original! It was super! In an age of superhero movies you'd think that they wouldn't be able to get it right with a sequel for a movie that came out 14 years ago.Yet they did, Brad Bird scored again! The key to this film's success is the pacing and flow. The movie feels very upbeat with energetic action and an engaging story. It has some quiet moments for storytelling but it never feels like the story comes to a halt. There is also plenty of humor but unlike say the Marvel movies it feels natural and doesn't come from dumb one liners but instead from slapstick and funny writing and a few running gags. This helps the story maintain a fast beat and the audience is almost always invested. The only real downside is that the villain is not nearly as good as the villain in the first movie. I don't wanna get into spoiler territory but it isn't as memorable or as entertaining as Syndrome (the first villain in these films). Once you watch it you'll see why. With that said, this is more than made up for with the family dynamic. This film continues the great family that we got a taste of in the first movie and devokes so much time into it. The only detracting flaw from the first movie that kinda pulls people away is the fact that a lot of the movie (at least in the beginning) deals with Mr. Incredibles mid-life crisis and not the family dynamic. But this wasn't a problem since this allowed him to be the main character and thus we feel a closer connection to him than we would with Elastigirl. Well, now it's full circle. Even if the first film has the better villain, this film gets the better family so it's pretty even. Holly Hunter, how do I say it, damn well killed it. She is so good in this movie! I had my doubts and I kinda expected her character to be a step backwards but she felt really natural. The perfect family dynamic from the first movie is preserved and even expanded on and Elastigirl is no exception. Also really liked Mr. Incredible who was my second favorite character from the last movie (Syndrome was number one). He goes through a pretty convincing arc and he is still a great father character, something that had become rare in animation today. The kids are great too, including Jack Jack who is hilarious as ever, and though Dash has a different voice actor (which I know is unavoidable) I am very pleased that it sounds so similar to the original and my suspension of disbelief was preserved. Go watch this movie, it's worth the wait and really fun to watch. If you loved the original you'll love this movie too. It's great. Super great. 9/10. Really fun to watch.","

For the battle, except for the self-blackout at the beginning, the other parts are all normal. It's really boring.

And I haven't even seen the second one so what the hell am I writing a review about?! Well, my fan-boy 10 out of ten is actually for the trailer and the short that Pixar made by cutting it out of the original. Jack-Jack is just perfect, and hilarious; I love the delighted/amused look on his face when he discovers he has laser sight for the first time -lets hope the kid doesn't have allergies when he grows up or he'll be sneezing and blowing off people's heads off left and right every spring.
This review does deserve a ""no helpful"" rating since I'm really just saying they did Jack-Jack perfectly - whoever did the animation for his character deserves a big fat bonus for their work - I'm going to see the movie in a theater and will buy it from Amazon just to see him discover his powers - which are awesome by the way - and the music when he ignites is a perfect match also.
I'm sure this is going to be one of the rare ""Im going to see it 14 or 15 times"" movies - which is saying a lot because lately I haven't even been able to watch through the entire movie of the last few that I was looking forward to but they turned out horrible new release movies that have been released.

The original was great (8/10 or 9/10), this was not. Even asking the kids all said they knew who the surprise 'villain' was early in the movie.
Many animated movies have a depth to the movie that both adults and kids enjoy. This did not. It was very simple humor. The main humor had to do with the super powers of the baby and how hard it is to be the Dad left alone with the baby. Just wasn't funny unless you really like simple humor.

As with most here the only things I enjoyed were Jak-jak and new CGI. other than that I could use my money back.","

"Incredibles 2","jacob-86349","17 June 2018","14 years and doesn't even come close to the original. Lacks depth, originality, and a decent script. Almost feels like a spin-off feel good movie. By no means is it bad, but the tone change as well as a weak story whilst living in the shadow of the first just leads to a huge disappointment.","

"Incredibles 2","admacgm","19 June 2018","SPOILER: I have occasionally been asked, ""What is your favourite movie?"" It is a question I find hard to answer but ""The Incredibles"" usually comes to mind.The first movie was brilliant on so many levels and all the characters had depth, even the minor ones like Mirage and Bob's boss. The tension between Bob and Helen felt real but was constrained in a way that was totally appropriate for a family movie. The humour was clever and tensions worked out in a thoroughly plausible way. The movie thoughtfully and often subtly explored family dynamics in a manner unprecedented in superhero movies or mainstream animated movies,In the first movie Bob and Helen were both strong, willful characters who learned from each other. They put effort into their marriage and were ultimately rewarded for it but it was portrayed realistically as a work in progressIn this movie, not.It was not brilliant on any level other that the technical. The animation was fantastic. Although I actually enjoyed the parts of the movie there was much I did not like.The characters lacked the depth of the first movie. Helen as others have pointed out was particularly shallow, ironic considering how aggressively feminist the plot was.The minor characters were like cardboard cutouts. The new superhero crew seemed to try to tick demographic boxes, although I am sure someone will rant there was none identifying as a woman of colour with a speaking part. (apart from Frozone's wife Honey)The tension between Bob and Helen was largely replaced by Bob's tension with the feminist world view. Bob's emasculation for most of the movie was nauseating to watch. While feminists may rejoice at the role reversal, I have met very few women who find underachieving, stay at home dads attractive.The villain was quite predictable and her story-line felt contrived.An over arching feminist agenda seemed to dominate the movie in a thoroughly skewed manner.Pro women:
1. the main superhero action was given to Helen. She is portrayed as nearly perfect and able to singlehandedly do almost anything.
2. the main superhero of the new group is Void
3. the main politician is the Ambassador
4. Violet gets a story arc but Dash gets very little. (Jack Jack does but babies are rather gender-less). Violet's superpowers save people several times
5. the technical wizards of the movie are both women and although Edna Mode is arguably transgender, she still identifies as a woman.
6. the evil genius is a woman but not that evil; almost as if to say women villains are so much nicer than male ones. She only tried to kill one person, where as Syndrome actually killed several. For a bonus feminist point she is quite possibly lesbian and therefore really does not need men at all.
7. Violet after much effort, angst and embarrassment finally gets her date with a nice guy, only to leave him standing at the ticket counter. The message is loud and clear, girls can do as they want, when they want and men should accept this without question. Anti men
1. Bob is portrayed as inept, reckless when doing the superhero thing and chauvinistic. Even when doing his superhero stuff, he never succeeds until one or more people are helping.
2. Dash has a relatively minor role and is often reckless and impulsive just like his dad. His most memorable achievement is stealing a car!
3. Rick Dicker a important male authority figure from the first movie, is portrayed as ineffectual and is put out to pasture.
4. Winston Deavor is arguably dangerously naive, implausibly altruistic and rather shallow.Finally the most ridiculous part of the whole movie. Jack Jack. It is a given that a certain suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy any superhero movie but usually there are rules to constrain the plot and make the story worth while and set up an internal coherence. Every Superman has his kryptonite and in another age every Achilles had his heel. In what universe is a baby with highly destructive, poorly controlled and nearly limitless superpowers a good idea? That Jack Jacks antics have such benign effects is implausible to say the least. However did the raccoon survive? By sheer political correctness I suspect. We can't have babies killing wild animals in a Disney movie. The internal realism of the first movie is thoroughly absent here.In summary it feels as if the original movie got a Neo-Marxist rewrite. There was enough spark left over from the original movie to make it watchable but not enough to redeem it.","

"Incredibles 2","stamp-587-149747","17 February 2019","This film reminded me of an old SNL skit--a skit from way back in ancient times, when SNL was actually funny. In the skit, Phil Hartman plays talk-show host Donahue, and he starts off an interview thusly: ""With us today is Dr. Norma Hoeffering, author of the book, Women Good, Men Bad..."". For me, that pretty much sums up the over-the-top PC level of Incredibles 2. Lots of other reviewers seem to have documented this aspect, so I won't add any more here.Beyond the PC overload, I also find it kind of annoying that they wasted Mr. Incredible on a never-ending Mr. Mom remake. That might have been funny for a few minutes, but it went on and on and on and on... And even once Mr. Incredible finally gets into the action, he doesn't really seem to have much to do.On the up side, the animation is fantastic (as always in a Pixar film), and the kids were pretty good. And, I liked Edna's scenes too.","

"Incredibles 2","JakeBrinkman","30 December 2018","First off, this movie needs a huge epilepsy disclaimer because there are several scenes that are very likely to give people problems.Though the movie was still very good, it didn't come close to matching the expectations set by the first movie. My biggest problem with this sequel was that the family did not seem to work as a team. In the first movie, the whole family was continually using their powers to complement each other. This movie had each Incredible acting largely on their own; all working towards the same cause, but usually not directly interacting with each other. This appears to be standard for modern superhero films, but the first Incredibles had lead me to expect more out of this sequel.","

"Incredibles 2","benraddon87","31 July 2018","I was mostly entertained by this. On YouTube there is a video which talks about this movie and the video was called the Rise of Feminism, I figured it was just someone trolling. Nope. 
Some of this movie was entertaining, 'some', but after watching it and thinking more about it, and looking at other reviews, I saw that it was right. Only if you're not paying attention at all, even when you're being bashed over the head with this would you not notice. 
The action was impressive, but Elastigirl feels like a Spider-man rip off, she pretty much just does what he would do, and men who are made to look useless and stomped on.
In a way I'm glad I have watched this so I can from my own opinion, but it's unlikely I'll be watching this again. I'm done with movies which force political agendas instead of just giving us qualify entertainment, that's why I've stopped bothering with the new Star Wars franchise, and I'm sticking with the classic originals. 
Anything else wrong with this movie has already been covered in other reviews.
One last thing for any ladies who are reading this to think about...if a movie was released with the deliberate underlying message that woman are idiots, would you watch it? I highly doubt it, chances are you would be deeply offended.","

The Incredibles for me falls under the decent category, I don't understand what was the big hype about this one and still don't to this day. Now look it's not bad but it wasn't my cup of tea. This sequel doesn't quite live up to the expectations of it's first film and honestly compared to the one 14 years ago they used the same formula that didn't quite mesh well this time around. Weak story, Villain very predictable and the action might be too intense for some viewers.I don't hate this film but again it just wasn't for me and I may not understand why everyone likes it so much...So take this review with a grain of salt","

It's too preachy to be escapist, but too uncommitted to be a feminist diatribe. There's none of the wonder, peril or heart of the original, and it adds nothing to it.It feels like a fading echo, drowning in a horrible over-blown score that's just one extended brassy blare.","

"Incredibles 2","willz187","26 February 2019","This movie is filled with too much anxiety. From the domestic yelling and arguing, to the temperamental baby, to the frenetic, sensory-assailing action sequences. I watch movies to get away from all this, to have fun. Intense action doesn't always equal fun, when there's so much going on you can't follow. Too much tension between characters and none of them come off well. The story itself has been done to death and was already covered in the first Incredibles. Difficult to appreciate the beauty of the animation with all this going on.","

In the last movie it was Mr. Incredible that try to fix that law but in this movie it was Elastigirl. The characters were alright, the Incredible family has been developing nicely but Jack-Jack seemed way to OP. The antagonist was just straight up lame, no super powers and her motives and personality seemed plain and stupid. The visuals have drastically improved since it has been 14 years since the last movie. The music was very good mainly with the use of trumpets.Overall a semi enjoyable film.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely..","

It seems the only thing Pixar forgot about in this movie is that it should be a kid flick....the plot, the setting, the music, the jokes and everything in this movie is too much for adults rather than for kids, lacking essential childish creativity and fun, which is a shame given that the first Incredibles was one of the funniest and witties of all of Pixars great movies.","

"Incredibles 2","kermitkid","31 March 2020","Although the plot is not as good as the first one, it is still worth the 14 year wait. The first half could have been improved immensely though, because for the first hour or so it feels like a gender-swapped rehash of the first one, and plays more like a direct-to-video sequel like the ones Disney used to put out. The first half still has its moments though, particularity the ones with Jack-Jack and the trouble he gets into. A lot of the humor in the first half does come from those scenes, and is more visual based. After the first hour, the plot definitely picks up and reaches a satisfying conclusion. There is still plenty of great action, and the villain, while not as good as Syndrome from the first movie, does deliver a pretty great monologue that makes you think for a moment that their goal isn't so bad, but simply the methods they are using to reach that goal. When it finally is revealed who the villain is though, it does feel stolen from a certain Marvel movie that shall remain unnamed so as to avoid spoilers. The animation is still gorgeous, (though the character of a newscaster does look like an animated caricature like the ones you would get drawn of yourself at a carnival and he just looks creepy), and some of the best voice acting is from Bob Odenkirk. He is one of the best characters in the film. It is disappointing that the film, in terms of plot and character development, had to take a bit of a step backward. What made the first film so unique was seeing the family dynamic and the family using their powers to help each other out. Here, we get very little of that. It has the typical ""The dad is stupid and hapless and needs the mom to fix all his mistakes, har dee har"" stuff that's done to death in just about every sitcom on tv, and that's disappointing, especially from a so-called ""family"" company like Disney. Haven't we as a society moved past this? In a world where everyone is crying for ""equal rights and representation"", shouldn't we get true equality? Equality does not mean superiority at the so-called ""privileged"" individual or party's expense,and that's disappointing to see here. It also had some unnecessary (albeit mild) profanity, which was also disappointing. (Again, ""family"" company) Overall, it is worth seeing. Just don't expect it to be as thrilling as the first one.

The characters are what we remembered them to be, the action was fun and the plot was entertaining. Adding more supers to the movie allowed for some unique fight scenes and new story arcs. The Screenslaver was a good villain who was menacing enough with good reasons for being evil. However I wish the Screenslaver would have done a little more during the action scenes but I'm fine with what they did. I also would have liked them to play with our emotions a bit more during the 3rd act. The music was as good as the original and the ending was really satisfying.","

"Incredibles 2","Blazehgehg","19 April 2019","There's honestly nothing really wrong with The Incredibles 2. If all you're looking for is a solid family movie, it's enjoyable enough, with lots of action and fun characters.But I can't shake the feeling that there's something about it that's... ""off"" feeling. It took Pixar fourteen years to make a sequel that is, by all accounts, a little more than average. The original Incredibles was a breath of fresh air, and the best super hero movie in its time. It broke new ground for Pixar in every aspect.This just feels like the next episode of a television series. Everyone is kind of settling in to a status quo and the adventures continue. I know it's a weird complaint for a movie that's not actually bad.Part of that, I think, has to do with the film's themes. The first Incredibles had the villain Syndrome, who defined the whole movie's attitude toward super heroes. It touched on how fans interact with their idols, the reality of being a ""super"", and the very real reasons people may resent them for their enhanced abilities. Those elements anchored everything in something more thoughtful than just punching out the bad guys in a secret volcano lair.The Incredibles 2 lacks that anchor. It hamfistedly gestures towards the topics of media consumption and gender equality, but ultimately chooses to say nothing about either issue. Instead, it fills most of the movie with very standard superhero antics punctuated by smaller slices of family dynamic. It's all still fun... but they just aren't as deeply rooted as the themes of that first movie.Again, it's just The Incredibles, but more of it. And unlike some movie sequels that feel like they're trying to replicate the formula of the first movie, Incredibles 2 stands out as its own thing. It just doesn't breach any new subjects. Instead, it comfortably rests in the shadow of the original.For most people, that's good enough. But I was hoping for something a little more incredible.","

That's way too late. So this is great but not near as good as the original Incredibles which is... Well.. INCREDIBLE.","

The Man gets to do the woman job. He sucks at it first ( of course) but makes everything right by the end. Woman gets the man's job. She is just perfecto. Nothing can be wrong in the hands of a woman. The film relies way too heavily on the baby got powers comedy. It works for a time before getting tiring near the end. There is a major twist too which not a twist but an insult to the basic IQ of today's moviegoers. That happens when a movie with few characters tries to build a mystery around the main villain. Nothing special, no surprises. Just nothing. Highly predictable movie. Only good part is the two big goose bumping action scenes (The Underminer's and the metro rail one). Minus them and the movie is a giant turd in everything. The hype is fake this time around. Can't believe how critics just give free passage to such movies in the name of entertainment.

now seeing the whole family back at it again trying to stop the underminer only for some strange reason they let him escape I mean thats not a bad thing but they could have surly saved the town from destruction but then again there wouldn't be a story for this movie if they hadafter they get back to the hotel nothing really happens for about 20 mins or except for them moping and arguing and then after that we get a few minutes of suspense and some action i would say totally not even 25 min 
the stay at home dad thing was kinda funny but mostly kinda boring
Jack jack was the whole show he was the only reason i stayed watching it because of his humor and sillinessThe villain in the film i noticed who it was right away and she really doesn't do much or then again you never see it since they don't show it
all you see is a flashing screen hypnotizing people
unlike Syndrome who in my opinion was a great villain really shows off how much of a bad ass he is but screen slayer is so boring it makes dr evil look like a genuiseand non of the family except elastic girl suit up until the last 20 minutes of the film you don't even get to see frozone in this he has so little time this film could have done without him
oh and when they say jack jack has 17 powers i didn't see 17 i saw mybe 8 but may have missed some
another thing how didn't the parents remember jacks powers when he used them on Syndrome in less they suffered amnesia 
an one more thing they should have done was shown more of the kids powers like how they have adjusted to them is there anything new to them but instead its the same oh same oh this has a few laughs some decent special effects but not enough action of the combination in 14 years they could have perfected there art but instead were lazy and didn't put enough effort into what made the first one so great

Why Pixar did not write a new story, I wish I knew. This movie is simply a role reversal with forced comical attempts from jack jack, who is arguably the best part of the movie.

"Incredibles 2","SAMTHEBESTEST","22 June 2018","THE INCREDIBLES 2 REVIEW :
'Pixar does it again'... Whenever i see Pixar films this sentence has always made it to appear in my review/mind. Long wait of 14 years, so much anticipation finally comes to end with a Worthy sequel to The Incredibles. The Incredibles does entertain you throughout and on a high note tells some family values lessons as well. Comedy, humour, thrills everything is just perfect and so does the film.Story is about Superheroes are not legal, they should not use their powers which causes the destruction so they gotta stay at home like common people. Then how they survive from a conspiracy in a heroic style which better be seen in theater. We know 4 superhero characters in previous films and the addition of new cute little superhero is surprisingly amazing. Background music for the same is very effective and accurate as far as that particular scene is concerned. Cinematography is Excellent, especially in action scenes those moving camera angles will blow your mind. Visual effects are eye pleasing. Director has done a mind blowing job by keeping this excellent written product entertaining and engaged from the first frame to the last.Overall, The Incredibles 2 a Must See for Pixar Lovers, at some moments it looks even better than it's prequel. On a funny note i say, Marvel should take lessons from Pixar on how to make a Terrific Superhero film barring regular money making stuff. I never thought The Incredibles will have a Sequel and after watching The Incredibles 2 i want more and more sequels in this franchise. With a grin smile on my face, i rate it 7/10*","

"Incredibles 2","mullikine","29 June 2018","Incredibles 2 was such a disappointment, even for me. i loved the first one. i'd find 2 hours of elevator music more memorable. no way near as imaginative as the original. you can only take so much shock value comedy, like americas funniest home videos. the dramatic music is the modern day substitution for canned laughter and reminds me of the way old movies would double the playback speed to make james bond look like he could punch someone, do a barrel role and plant his ski poles in under 5 seconds -- the drama is cringy. the movie was predictable every time it gave you a moment to think. sometimes it felt like the characters are on the set of Tommy Wiseau's The Room, awkwardly making irrational decisions, such as Dash simply not removing eye masks. unlike how in the first movie every character appeared to use their powers to the best of their ability, this time they were only used when convenient to move the plot forward. this movie feels like a cargo cult version of the original, having been run past the engineers at the last minute, to make sure it is functional enough to prove the critics wrong. it's like the modern day equivalent of 100 roadrunner skits end to end. itchy and scratchy has more anticipation, transformers has more character development and shortland street has far more realistic drama. forced, contrived, unimaginative, predictible, just like everything disney makes these days.","

"Incredibles 2","amentagregory","8 June 2018","Great Movie! This movie seems to really improve on the original, with the same memorable characters such as Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Edna, with new break-out characters, notably Jack-Jack. Micheal Giacchino nailed the score, and like other Pixar/Disney films there are amazing visuals. However, the thrill and brain of this movie, differentiates itself from the traditional cookie-cutter PG animated films. So far, it has been highly rated by critics, and could be one of the biggest releases of 2018. I can't wait for Incredibles 3.","

There are some funny moments that gives breathing room in the story and it is not until the later half of the movie that it goes downhill. Mainly due to the very predictable plot, the pacing is all over the place and there is nothing really memorable in the later part of the movie.","

Although it didn't have the originality of the original, it was a bet fun movie. It's apparent that the animation technology has drastically improved, and the movie once again shines when all the superheroes team up to use their powers together. I understand that this movie has elastigirl as the central character, but she's not as engaging of a main character on her own. Maybe next movie could feature the entire family a bit more.","

The credits and the final scene act exactly like that of the first movie and gives you a nostalgic feeling after leaving the theater. They keep all the characters strong, and Jack-Jack and the raccoon was overall adorable and well crafted in its animation. Winston, portrayed by Odenkirk, is a great added character to this film. I'm glad that Pixar was able to craft another great sequel, being as great or better than others. I'm excited for what else Pixar will be presenting in later years.","

The animation is as great and the characters are engaging, as expected. The problem is that the story isn't as compelling as the original. It didn't feel like much was happening, honestly. Most of the family is doing normal stuff for most of the movie while Elastigirl and Jack Jack take center stage. The film doesn't take many risks and it suffers because of that. Clearly, there will be a third Incredibles movie but Pixar may have hurt future audiences' expectations by trying to not mess anything up with this sequel.","

"Incredibles 2","dee.reid","9 August 2019","I'll be quick and to-the-point. ""The Incredibles"" (2004) was simply the best and greatest animated film to come out in 2004. It was a love-labor to superhero lore, as well as a bold-faced SATIRE of superhero lore - done in animated form, by the one American animation studio to top them all off, Pixar. ""The Incredibles"" was a box office success and critical hit. So the question was, how could writer-director Brad Bird and his team of animators at Pixar follow it up?We got that answer with 2018's ""Incredibles 2."" While not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it grips you from its opening moments and holds your attention for the entire duration of its 118-minute running time. This sequel is bigger, bolder, and more family-centered than the first one; but don't let that fool you, there are still plenty of thunderous action sequences and moments of laugh-out-loud comedy and genuinely heartfelt family times to keep you interested.Do yourself a favor, and watch one of the most ""Incredible"" sequels ever made.9/10","

"Incredibles 2","LovelyAndJubbly","22 February 2020","--Skip to Section 4 for my final opinion--This movie, in my opinion, is just a cash grab banking in on the Incredibles' name. It's a bit like all the new Disney live action remakes, just there to make money off of our nostalgia. I watched this film in cinema when it came out, it was a waste of my money.The first film is a classic, an example of family entertainment done right. This film, however, pales in comparison to it's predecessor. Now I've been quite vague during this review, so SPOILER WARNING:1. Villain is terribly written.The villain in this film, Screenslaver (real name Evelyn Deavor), is TERRIBLE. Compared to Syndrome (the villain of Incredibles 1), who had a legitimate reason to hate superheroes and (more specifically) Mr. Incredible, it took me a while to figure out what the hell Screenslaver's motives were. A VILLAIN'S MOTIVES SHOULD BE CLEAR AND MAKE SENSE FOR THEIR SITUATION.Screenslaver's motives are that her father was killed by a robber and the superheroes, who had been OUTLAWED, couldn't save him. That makes NO SENSE, either her father was a complete moron or the writers couldn't think of an original motive.2. The plot is... bad.This film has one of the most predictable and terribly written plots I have seen in recent films and I've watched the Secret Life of Pets. It's just the hero's journey with a bit of a super twist.Unlike the first film, which had nuance, humour, action and emotion all in one film, I felt NOTHING whilst watching the sequel. A GOOD FILM MAKES YOU FEEL.3. The positives.The graphics are amazing, as expected from Disney-Pixar in 2018, and there was an hilarious sub-plot with Jack-Jack developing his powers, it had me and a lot of other people in my local cinema laughing.Do the positives outweigh the negatives? I don't think so.4. Final words.Just watch the first one, the second one is sub-par, barely entertaining enough for a baby film. Skip this film, watch the other Pixar classics.","

"Incredibles 2","dwpollar","16 June 2020","1st watched 8/12/2018 :
Action-based CGI entry from Pixar doesn't have much more than this, and therefore disappoints. In this sequel, the movie starts with ""Super Heroes"" being against the law, and the family trying to hang as ""just"" a family. A high-falooting business man has an idea to bring them back in the fold and hires the mom(because she destroys less stuff) to do some work to help turn the tides on the idea of bringing them back. Therefore dad has to do some of the normal mom stuff like taking care of a baby who has newfound powers. For some reason - Pixar added very little humor to this movie. The baby did some funny things, but that was about it. There was some unique animation(including one seen with the evil character) which could invoke seizures in some, but sorry that's not enough for a good movie. I have seen a lot of action scenes, and pretty much anything can be done in computer animation so it's ho-hum if there is not a story you want to follow and characters you care about. This had neither. A lot of time and effort was put into creating this sequel, but in my eyes it wasn't worth it.","

"Incredibles 2","achmoye","26 October 2018","What happened ?The first volet was nice and complex, pleasing both adults and children and this is just an explosion of bright color to please families who bring their kids.
Basically this movie is for kids.
All characters are void, every scene is a Superhero fight and it's messy and annoying. Gimme a break from casting superpowers. The very first scene is a crazy attack by a supervilain and every else follows as a fast-paced nonsense.
There is no breaks, transitions, just an endless flow of CGI like Disney knows how to do now. I guess the magic from 2D Disney movies is just dead.Another problem : they casted the guy from Better Call Saul to play...some kind of lawyer. They basically extracted this character from Breaking Bad and put him, and his voice, in the movie. This is what you do when you have no ideas about character design and character develpment.I don't buy that the sister fights crime at the end and leaves her boyfriend alone like an old sock, and does the most moral, responsible choice. Like hell she does, at her teenager age.Characters just show off their abilities without any interesting plot or development. This movie is an incredible failure. As always, the more money in involved, the more likely you are to fall into a huge pile of CGI epileptic mess.Goodbye, Disney. I'm gonna watch Mulan now.","

"Incredibles 2","shadow_blade-89459","14 March 2019","""Incredibles 2"" (2018) is a professionally animated action adventure comedy that carries the loveable fun from ""The Incredibles"" (2004). In this sequel, the family is charged with changing the concept of ""supers"" through recorded hero actions with Helen, Elastigirl,"" voiced by Holly Hunter, taking the lead. I loved the role reversal with Helen being the desired hero to take the lead, but I think the added screen time for Jack Jack, voiced by Eli Fucile, was the biggest family favorite. Everything Jack Jack did in this film produced hysterical laughter in my family. I am usually very skeptical of sequels, but this film is just as good as the first one with exception to some heavy foreshadowing.Brad Bird continues his reputation with character connections to the audience. Every character is identifiable in my own family and I just love that. The story is great, but anticipated, which makes the foreshadowing so difficult to avoid. To keep from spoiling the film, I would say the best way to have adjusted the undesired, would have been to make the bad guy a little less sketchy. This way it is a little less obvious that the bad guy is essentially broadcasted from the beginning. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and recommend a view if you enjoyed the first one, but once you have deciphered the ""evil one,"" keep it to yourself until the end and just enjoy the film.","

I did love the plot so the 5 stars are really a 10 for that but editing is a must to avoid distracting from this. All actors get a 9 or a 10. When the movie gets too unreal, trying to do too much in a short moment of time you will get back into Earth's reality and a cartoon should keep you into the fun imagination of another world.","

The plot was a rehash of the first and the villain was apparent from the moment she stepped onto the screen. The film also felt disjointed and they turned the kids into brats that contributed nothing. The ending didn't make any sense either. Why were the people cheering for the supers when the last broadcast they saw was the supers saying they were going to destroy them. The citizens didn't know that the supers were being controlled so their cheering made no sense... Sadly this is the first Pixar movie that I really disliked.","

This one really surprised me with all the drinking and curse words. Having to explain afterwards to my 4 year old that we don't say those things is pretty embarrassing. Next time I will be looking up Parent Reviews before paying to watch it in the theater. The kids did enjoy all the parts with Jack Jack, and the teenage hormones were quite humorous.

"Incredibles 2","alexissebastian","17 June 2018","Funny and fast paced: granted. Should that be enough? My two main concerns;1) Everything feel forced: by example, the character of Edna is brought back with no real justification (the choice to babysit Jack-Jack, really?). You may cut her scenes and the plot remains the same. She is not here because the story needs her; this is the usual ""making by the numbers"" that defines Disney these days.2) The motivation of the villain is extremely weak. (Spoiler ahead) She is upset because her father believed in superheroes and he lost his life during a home invasion. Sorry, but it sounds that she must consume her energies for revenge against petty criminals, instead of superheroes (Imagine somebody close is killed during an assault but police arrive late... Will you decide to convert into a vigilante against police officers or against criminals?). Once again, this feel extremely forced.I know that the majority of moviegoers just want the thrills and easy laughs (thanks, Jack-Jack) and put character motivations and plot in second plane. If that is your case, you will have a great time indeed.","

It was brilliant- but be warned that there are some intense images and scenes. Just like with the first movie, younger audiences might be bored or scared. I would suggest six and up. There was a wonderful segment at the very beginning of the movie where some of the voice actors and the director came out and essentially said- we know it's been a long time guys but we promise it will be worth it. And boy was it. Picking up where the first movie left off, superheros are still not in favor with society. The super heroes trying to change that leads them to learn more about family and winning together. A movie to watch with your kids!

"Incredibles 2","dp-17275","28 February 2019","An excellent Pixar film, and a great sequel to the Incredibles. While it doesn't surpass the original, it is right beside it. Somehow after so many years this movie continues the same story-line and even small subplots from the original and manages to have the same tone and feeling. The animation improvement and higher budget is well utilized and noticeable. This film has heart thanks to Brad Bird's excellent writing and directing. The villain is standard but the best aspect of the film is when the family just behaves like a family. The voice actors are great as it does feel like a direct continuation of the original, Dash is the only character with a voice actor change, and you wouldn't even notice. The score is excellent by Michael Giacchino. This movie is great and I could not recommend it more.","

I also really loved getting to see Jack Jack's powers in action too. Overall if you adore the first one, check it out. Unless if you don't like sequels. The first movie I give a 9 out of 10. The second one I give an 8 out of 10.","

"Incredibles 2","MovieManChuck","26 August 2018","3.5/4After 14 years, the highly anticipated ""Incredibles 2"" waltzes into theatres. Based on the trailer, and the fact that Pixar has (in recent years) started to become more hit-or-miss with their efforts, I had very low expectations set for this movie. Of course, I watch it opening night, and while it doesn't quite match the first one, it's still a great movie.Incredibles 2 picks up right where it's predecessor left off, at the track meet with The Underminer making his debut. It's general theme is concerning the Parr family's attempt to bring supers back into legality and legitimacy. This movie takes a shift in its primary focus and puts the spotlight on Elastagirl, as she takes her turn in saving the day.The Parrs were perfected upon, and the action was one tough act to follow. Some of the powers really make for some great sequences. The kinky romance between Violet and Tony was fun to view, and Jack Jack was incontrovertibly awesome. On the flip side of things, some of the ""new heroes"" introduced were simply downright annoying to me, and the villain was predictable (and maybe a bit ineffective if you ask me). However, a few unlikable characters aren't going to kill the fun.While this movie didn't quite resonate with me in the way the original did, the original set some pretty mean standards. The Incredibles one of the greatest family movies ever made. Incredibles 2 is great as well, just don't go in expecting a repeat of the first one.","

"Incredibles 2","Mr-Fusion","21 September 2018","PIXAR sequel fatigue has given way to a certain cynicism over the years, but ""Incredibles 2"" nicely withstands such negativity. Sure, we should've gotten this movie years ago, but it also provides ample summer fun. It's a feat that Brad Bird is able to make scenes of mundane domestic life as entertaining as the crowd-pleasing action scenes. I do think that Jack-Jack *is* this movie, but in any case, I enjoyed myself throughout.If I have one complaint, it's the score. Giacchino goes way overboard with the horns.","

"Incredibles 2","jre-5","3 January 2020","The Incredibles 1 is my favorite animated movie since the 1990s (when I was a kid), and the only one that I ever purchased. For a long time I was really looking forward to the sequel. But I was disappointed with it.The biggest problem is that too much time is spent with Helen doing all the hero work while Bob stays home doing nothing besides trying to take care of the kids. This isn't a bad story line, but it goes on for much too long. Bob eventually gets involved, but there's not a lot of times when he gets to use his super strength. There's not a lot of times when Dash gets to use his super speed either. I also thought it was annoying how rude Violet acts. I also didn't like it that Jack Jack has a whole bunch of powers and constantly causes problems. I can see why lots of people would like this, but I liked it much better when he wasn't around. Furthermore, his numerous powers make the lead characters seem a lot less special. The presence of numerous new super heroes further adds to this.It's not a bad movie, I did enjoy some of it, but it's just too unbalanced, I thought it felt sort of like a really long version of one of those minor sequels (like ""Jack Jack Attack"", ""Frozen Fever"" etc.). ""Incredibles 1"" had a lot more of a plot to it and was overall a much better movie.","

Incredibles 2 is the most corporate and boring film of the year so far. This film commits the worst offender of a sequel possible, not needing to exist. Nothing was gained, nothing important happened. All the characters are in the exact same spot from the beginning of the film to the end. There is no arc for anyone. The villain is one of the worst villains in cinema history. The plot is the most predictable and boring plot of recent years. There are some enjoyable things though. The action is fantastic, the humor mostly works, and some characters like Frozone and Violet are more interesting than others. Overall this is the safest thing Disney could have done with this film and it really shows. It's a shame because this could have been a fantastic film.","

"Incredibles 2","ThomasDrufke","21 June 2018","It took 14 years for an Incredibles sequel, and for some, that was far too long. I spend a good chunk of my time online reading articles and watching videos related to movies and television. I can't think of a single movie that people clamored more for than another Incredibles adventure. I like the first movie, but it would fall very far down the list of Pixar movies for me. So when they finally announced a sequel a few years ago, my reaction was pretty much nothing. Really, I just needed reassurance that if you're going to make a sequel 14 years after the original, there better be a darn good reason to do it. Well, after seeing the end result, I can't really think of a good reason why Pixar pulled the trigger on this one (other than the obvious - money). Is there anything overtly refreshing about Incredibles 2? Nope. It's predictable, unorginal, and uninspired. What I will say is that there are some very impressive action sequences and it was nice to see Elastigirl take center stage. Watching Jack Jack do his superhero-y things is also a joy to watch. However, the first film had a sharp script with just as much laughs as it did heart, and an obscure villain that somehow worked. I can't necessarily say the same about Incredibles 2, which falls into the trap of a rehashed script and a horrendously botched villain. Is the film entertaining and worth a glance? Perhaps, but if you're looking for something that improves on its predecessor, you should look elsewhere.6.8/10","

"Incredibles 2","sikdogsshaq","17 June 2018","Saw it last night with my wife and two kids(3 and 5). Kids really laughed only at Jack Jack. Certainly not the level of amazement and immersion we experienced watching the the first Incredibles. I saw the first one back in the day and then just last week on video with my kids, just to prepare for Incredibles 2. Sorry to say i was extremely disappointed.Pros:
1. Animation and action scenes were amazing
2. The few times the family worked together to fight the bad guys.
3. Jack-JackCons(some, not all):
1. Before the movie started, why did they show the voice actors introducing the movie and ""telling"" us we'll love it? they are all old. That kinda messed me up since the movie continued in the parking lot after Dash's track meet where they were still young(2004). So my image of the parents and kids would still be those of where the first film left off. I love Holly Hunter, but their faces messed me up for like the first 30 min. but then i forgot about the intro.2. The villain(unknown to Helen) and Helen drinking alcohol when they got together. Just seemed strange for a kids movie and was like they were trying to tell us that women need to relax and drink too.3. Sequences with the kids: Bob being completely defeated caring for the kids. the kids disrespecting him all the time. I understand that is normal adolescent behavior, but why do they portray him as a total weakling.4. Forced diversity: the fricken green haired hero, i also saw a pink haired one, what was that big Brick ""they"" hero? The possessed bad guy heroes looked skinny and wimpy. And the old guy with vomit acid reflex powers? It wasn't funny.5. Probably shouldn't be a con by a guys standard, but Helen's curvy figure was distracting. it was like she was drawn to be super hot(with bigger boobs in some scenes) but still be a powerful mother..or something. Although hot, it didn't help the story.6. Weak villain. It wouldn't be a waste to see it at the movie theatre. just don't expect that you'll leave the theatre fulfilled like you did with the first movie.","

"Incredibles 2","Jisk","15 November 2019","Incredibles 2 is not a bad movie, per se, but it does not exactly take off the way the first one did. There was so much originality and genuine surprise in the first one and this one has little of that. The same great characters are there but the circumstances they have to face in this one are nowhere near as cool or interesting as in the first movie. There are a lot of nice moments here but they just don't add up to as compelling a narrative as we had in the first one. Which is too bad. They spend a lot of time and energy on the whole ""should supers be illegal or legal"" or not idea, and frankly I don't think the audience really cares too much about that. We've had X-Men movies and Watchmen traverse this exact same territory and the villain in this one is no Syndrome. So on the whole the film, especially if you are a fan of the first, is a bit of a letdown. There are some new supers here but they don't get much screen time. The most interesting ""new"" development is the discovery of jack jacks powers, which lead to the films most spontaneous moments. Which is too bad because Incredibles deserved better IMO.","

I do not know if brilliance can come out of a world where current political and societal trends are the norm, but the world of Incredibles wasn't that world, precisely why it was brilliant, and trying to make its world seem like, or rather be, something it isn't, and in my opinion shouldn't be, caused the sequel to be unnatural and banal. Hence, even though it was created with means that are light years away and ahead than that of its predecessor, it eats the dust of it in quality and memorability. Still, it deserves some appreciation, but merely because of the fact that it is the inheritor of a brilliant story and a brilliant world, perhaps long gone.","

"Incredibles 2","The-Last-Sith-Lord","5 August 2018","Since the first Toy Story, Pixar's movies always had amazed me, the originality, the story telling, the deep emotion that they were able to give to their characters, I remember myself crying on the end of Toy Story 3, Inside Out.. the good feelings that I had after watching Cars. But seems Pixar also joined the recently trend in Hollywood in making movies with political agendas and remove the budge of the creative and story telling department. 
The first Incredibles was great, very original, each character had it's place on the plot, you could see a family working together and the story felt super original. On this new one, it's more about ""strong female"" (they should make a movie of ""Strong Woman"" from South Park) and very predictable story (kind of story you can already know how it's going to end on the first 10min of the movie)It's a good movie to watch at home and just spend some time, when you don't have anything better to watch. It doesn't worth the ticket to watch on the theater. Hope Pixar can return to it good times and return to make good stories again without politics on it, as it seems they are really loosing their creativity upon political agenda since Cars 3. I love Pixar and I'm still looking forward for their future movies #MakePixarGreatAgain","

"Incredibles 2","Sam_Youno","2 July 2019","Thoroughly enjoyable, with (no surprise) astonishing animation, including a few sequences that manage to surpass the original. The increased focus on the Parr family's dynamics is handled with humour and restraint, and works far better than I'd feared. Jack-Jack is a complete delight, as of course is Edna Mode; and Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson manage to bring even more nuance to their characters---which were pretty damn good the first time round.But. . . . The plot, compared with Incredibles #1, seemed sprawling. Not ridiculously complex, but it lacked the original's laser intensity and clarity. Still, my main disappointment came early on, when we are told who the villain is, before any hint that there even IS a mastermind villain. We're introduced to Evelyn Deavor, and it takes about a quarter of a second to translate that into ""Evil Endeavor."" That reveals most of the subsequent plot, and the end of any suspense.I'll be watching the first ""Incredibles"" movie again, certainly, but not this one. And I hope there won't be a third.","

"Incredibles 2","valen060","26 June 2018","Things have changed greatly since the lighthearted 2004 Pixar hit The Incredibles. In this 2018 sequel, it feels more darker in content - like on the boundary line of PG to PG-13 - compared to its predecessor. See, unlike the original which played on the superhero genre of the early 2000s with sitcom-like humor, this feels like a blend of the current decade's juggernaut of ever-growing superhero movies with some maturity in these characters we've come to know those years ago.A few months have passed after Syndrome's defeat and the Parr Family have moved on with their lives as though nothing's happened. When a wealthy tycoon offers to bring Supers back into the spotlight, he asks Bob Parr's (aka Mr. Incredible) wife Helen (aka Elastigirl) to be the front in making it happen again, resulting in a new villain called the Screenslaver to wreak havoc.Compared to past Pixar films that spawned sequels (or a prequel) of their own, director Brad Bird did an impressive job by having these characters retain their sitcom-like quirks, but also including some character development that wasn't explored before. This is a sequel that was long overdue to be released years back and it was worth quite the wait (especially for the kids of 2004 who are now young adults in or out of college). The returning voice cast and the new cast members did splendidly well with their roles and the real scene-stealer has to go to both baby Jack-Jack and Edna. I wasn't bored in the least, it's a pretty good follow-up.","

"Incredibles 2","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","28 May 2022","Made 14 years after and set 13 seconds later, this sees Supers still illegal. The rich Winston Deavor(Bob Odenkirk, great as the lifelong fanboy) and his sister Evelyn(Catherine Keener, spot on as always) offer the aid of their private company to reform the image and change the laws. Meanwhile, the sinister screenslaver has other plans.Some people are frustrated with how woke this is. And in their defense some of them do acknowledge that the first one did take steps in that direction already. I don't agree that it's a bad thing, but I will grant that it does make some choices that feel like they're worried people will think they don't go far enough. In general there are issues with this, due to the expectations of fans who have wanted something like this since childhood and now have kids of their own to take to it. Some things are recreated even though it doesn't make sense because of completed(here undone) character arcs, and while I wouldn't personally say that I felt there was too much ""funny baby"" stuff, it's true that it has nothing to do with the plot.There are at least a few too many themes going on, and I hate to say that because I agree with them. They should have killed their darlings. Some of them just get brought up briefly and aren't explored at all. They didn't expect to get to make another sequel so they had to put everything into this one. The action and visual storytelling are indeed incredible. It's significantly grander and from right away, which some say leads to it not being as impactful. I think they felt that they had to match the other superhero movies of 2018 - you know, like the long-awaited Infinity War. However, I do agree that it's overall more impactful in the original one. The use of powers is always logical and tactical. Great choreography.I recommend this to any fan of comic book inspired films. 8/10.","

Now by no means is this sequel as good as the first but it is still well-done and very good for a sequel. I really enjoyed watching Bob take on the role of caring for the kids. The action sequences were very fast and entertaining beside the rapid flashing in the movie that might affect epileptic viewers. Anyway, this film is a lot of fun and it is also pretty humorous. There were a lot of times where a majority of the theater started chuckling and laughing so there was no absence of comedy. The villain arc was somewhat predictable but it still felt pretty satisfying and the story definitely had many interesting moments. The story flows well and should keep the whole family entertained.

Yes, because if they did not take that much time it wouldn't have been as solid as this film is for a sequel. Just come into this film wanting to have fun watching it.

On the other hand, I am not a major fan of Pixar's films released prior to this one ( particularly Cars 2 and Finding Dory). So what do I think about this sequel? It is a flawed but interesting movie. Yes the movie takes plot points from the first film (to a noticeable degree), and the films villain character is entirely unmemorable.

"Incredibles 2","gijoe-48397","10 March 2023","The plot picks up for the most part where the original ends. The Parr family of superheroes is going after the Underminer, and Violet's secret identity is exposed to her crush. The sequence continues as the baby is handed off between characters who want to contribute to the fight and it's meant to be played for laughs, but I honestly could not see everyone in this family being that dense and such glory seekers as to pass this baby off during a battle and it ruined the immersion and believability given how intelligent the decisions made in the original generally were. During the battle, a mysterious man witnesses it and gets excited about supers returning. When it ends, the Parr family is arrested before ultimately being released and Rick Dicker wipes the mind of Violet's crush. Displaced from their house with no money despite Bob clearly acquiring hefty amounts of it from Syndrome jobs in the first movie, they plan to live out of a hotel until Frozone shows up about an opportunity. They decide to meet this mysterious man from the opening who explains he wants to get supers legalized again using Helen as the poster child, totally passing over Frozone for some unfathomable reason. Seriously, in every clip, Frozone seems less destructive than either Bob or Helen and he is just completely ignored. The plot then switches between every day life as a super for Bob and Helen's vigilantism in the city and it is tedious. The original Incredibles was slicker with this balance and moved on from it after the first act. And yes, it was humorous in a way, but also emotionally melancholy as well as relatable. This just seems to play simply to degrade Mr Incredible as an incompetent stay-at-home dad and head of the household. Then we come to Jack-Jack... I don't understand how nobody in the family could deduce in the original movie that he had powers between the odd babysitter phone call and their vision angle of Syndrome's jet when he turned into fire. It's simply bad writing so the rest of the plot can happen. And Jack-Jack is clearly pushed to the front simply as a merchandising product than an actual character. His powers are whatever the plot needs or whatever will elicits cheap laughs for shenanigans. Helen meanwhile is on the trail of a villain who hypnotizes others by using video screens and while parts of that feel like a more traditional superhero film, they are few and far between, with her time mostly spent talking to Evelyn about how awesome they are. After the Screenslaver villain is 'allegedly' caught, Helen deduces that he really wasn't who he seemed and that it was Evelyn all along. Seriously, one would have to be a character in this film to not have seen that coming the moment she was introduced, intended or not. This is where the plot begins to drag with Bob, Helen, and a conglomerate of other supers being hypnotized into Evelyn's minions so she can ruin the future of super's forever. It shifts over to Dash and Violet infiltrating the yacht where the super legalization is taking place on a global scale using a super cheap setup and payoff sequence. During this Yacht part, Violet and Dash have to fight other supers and in one particularly sinful instance, there is absolutely no excuse for them not to remove the hypno-googles from supers, freeing them of the thrall. It all culminates in a final confrontation where Helen beats Evelyn by a conveniently placed flare gun.The characters more or less follow a circle than an arc, rehashing their original stories. Bob for some reason, is more selfish in this pursuit of being a legal superhero again, which wasn't a trait of his in the original. He loved his family more and just wanted a taste of the glory days, but always put them first. Violet becomes an insufferable and disrespectful know-it-all who gets mad about her crush losing his memory of her when she should really be grateful that her secret identity is so easily kept in tact, which was her own fault in the first place as well. Dash and Frozone aren't utilized much, but the biggest sin has to go to Jack-Jack. He is a walking plot device with no rules to his powers, as they simply do whatever the plot needs. Moreover, his presence in the film has all the earmarks of being a merchandise grab, as his value in the actual story could have been mitigated to a much higher degree with little loss. Still, the voice acting is on point at the end of the day, which helps to save face.The pacing and run time on this film is all over the place. The original slickly showed you the daily life of a super integrated into society for a short time before getting into the exciting meat. This film focuses on it so much to the point of painful. And at 2 hours, it starts to wear on you quickly.There was a fourteen year gap in the development between the Incredibles movies and it's surprising to see not much has changed on the VFX side of things. I see improvements, but nothing that screamed 'revolutionary'. What you see is serviceable and not bad on the eyes. Everyone and everything is recognizable, to which I am grateful. But it is not anything your eyes will pop out at.The soundtrack is a slightly less memorable take of the original. You will still hear beats from that first movie that were so iconic, but then there are tracks that are just white noise by comparison. Sound design itself is still solid... when it's used. Rarely do you get the audio cocktail the original had.The rewatchability is much lower on this film and I can almost guarantee most, if presented with the option of watching this or the original, will 99 out of 100 times pick the original.Overall, The Incredibles 2 feels more of a chore to get through than the original. The plot isn't as airtight and humor often falls flat or even resorts to immaturity. The characters regress in likability across the board. The graphics and sound are mostly serviceable. And the desire to rewatch is much lower than the previous. While it definitely never ventures into the territory of unwatchable or even bad, I really cannot call it 'good' either. It's an ok-at-best flick that's probably worthy of the 2 hour investment, if only for a solo watch.","

The villian gets taken into a jet engine. Thats adult. This second film exapands upon that level of seriousness. It is action filled and still has the same stylish tone as the first. Just because people don't like the drinking, it doesn't mean its a bad movie. Just over protective parents who don't want their kids to know about ""adult"" things in a pixar movie.","

"Incredibles 2","mrnajafi-22368","6 August 2019","Every detail of any movie counts and as far as the voices for characters go, they are not good. It's true that they used original actors of The Incredibles (2004) but voice of Holly Hunter was awful and it sounded like a 60+ years old woman and it didn't match the character (elastigirl).",NA

"Incredibles 2","lawrencejbutcher","21 July 2018","Can't say fairer than that right? My Kids Loved it. A lot on this review board talking about 'castrated male's and 'feminist agendas' really need to take a step back and stop being so delicate and easily offended. My Kids Loved It. Your kids will too.",NA
"Incredibles 2","tavm","16 June 2018","When The Incredibles came out 14 years ago, I remember enjoying it immensely. So me and my same friend just watched this sequel just now and it was also very enjoyable! There seems even more to laugh at-at least more after not much happens during the first 30 minutes-as the narrative goes into overdrive during the climatic scenes near the end. I don't feel like revealing much-and it's not like many reviews here aren't mentioning the highlights that I loved as much as they did-so I'll just say that me and my movie theatre-working friend highly recommend Incredibles 2!",NA

"Incredibles 2","amandasmith-17194","16 June 2018","I had to look and see who this movie was made by and was a little shocked that it was Disney. For one, they had two blatant cuss words, damn and hell, and the villain was a little Hannibal like. I feel like this is what is wrong with the world and what the world's norm is becoming. Why do you have to have ""I'll be damned"" in the movie, can you not think of another saying? It's as if now it is ok for children to use these ""light"" cuss words. And, yes I did see that someone also posted a seizure warning which I can totally see because there is a LOT of flashing. The movie was too long and the only thing I can say good is that it was action so it did keep my attention most of the time.",NA
"Incredibles 2","jon.h.ochiai","18 June 2018","Bob Parr, retired Superhero Mr. Incredible now Mr. Mom, voiced by Craig T. Nelson, discovers that his infant son Jack-Jack, goo goo-ed by Eli Fucile, shoots deadly green lasers from his eyes. He cautions his older daughter Violet, voiced by Sarah Vowell, and her younger brother Dash, voiced by Huck Milner, while playing with their brother, ""Don't fire the baby!"" Now, you won't hear that in movies. I'll even go out on a limb here.That's the signature humor and inventiveness of Writer and Director Brad Bird's ""Incredibles 2"". ""Incredibles 2"" is really incredible, too. ""2"" is the sequel 14 years in the making. The technological advance in state-of-the art animation since astounds. In the visual high speed chase Helen's Elastic Girl, voiced with down home charm and common sense by Holly Hunter, swerves her motorcycle as she rescues the out-of-control monorail train. In the stunning night skyline Elastic Girl hops between helicopters with her rubber-like arms to save the Ambassador. Still with Bird flexing his formidable CGI might, he touches when Bob confesses to daughter Violet, ""I just want to be a good Dad."" Nelson is humorous and vulnerable as the Dad. Bob was responsible for her possible boyfriend Tony's imposed memory loss to guard the family's identity. Violet is devastated when Tony forgets their movie date. Yeah, Dad and Mom using their super strength and elastic powers stopped the villainous Underminer, comical John Ratzenberger, and his hulking drilling machine. Bob messed up big time where it also counted, with family. Family and heart ultimately save the day in ""Incredibles 2"". ""Incredibles 2"" is hysterical in its cool self-awareness and irreverence. ""2"" has the hip retro 60's vibe in its art deco design and music score by Michael Giacchino. You get the feel of a James Bond or ""In Like Flint"" movie. Well, just shows my age. ""Supers"" or Superheroes are still outlawed in the world of ""Incredibles 2"". The movie literally opens where we left off 14 years ago as the Incredibles battle the Underminer determined to destroy the City. Emerging victorious the Family is forced back into seclusion. Brother and sister Winston and Evelyn of high-technology Dev Tech, voiced by slick Bob Odenkirk and sublime Catherine Keener, offer the Parr's their proposal. Winston and Evelyn seek to overturn the ban on Supers. Their late Father was the Supers greatest advocate. Both parents were tragically murdered when Supers were unable to save them from a home robbery. Marketing expert Winston wants to leverage Elastic Girl in the TV PR campaign to overturn the law. It's kind of like Reality TV for the good cause. Well, kind of. Swallowing his ego, because they opted out Mr. Incredible, Bob agrees that Helen should be the Star. Near half-way through the movie you get the telegraph that all is not what it seems. Perhaps, that's the only downside of Writer Bird's incredible narrative. Director Bird does provide the brilliant upside in the return of diminutive Supers costume designer extraordinaire Edna Mode or E. E graciously babysits and costumes Jack-Jack leashing and tracking some of his emergent powers. Bird is genuinely hysterical voicing E. And ""Incredibles 2"" is absolutely hysterical with endearing sweetness.At times action movie overload occurs, particularly near the end. The amazing CGI tends to overwhelm a bit. Yet, when Helen tells her children how proud she is of them that resonates home. Because when it comes down to it: Love makes you Super. I just hope Bird, Disney and Pixar don't wait another 14 years to tell another ""Incredibles"" story about love and family.",NA
