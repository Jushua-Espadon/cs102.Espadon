"danielmanson","23 November 2019","It's good. I had no idea what to expect in all honest. I am not huge fans of other movies by these actors, but this really worked. You could see the great chemistry between them all and it paid off.What I liked: I enjoyed how it didn't dither about at the beginning and got right into the action. Jack Black especially was brilliant and hilarious! All the actors/actresses were great but Jack Black stood out. Good mix of action and comedy throughout. I was on the edge of my seat (metaphorically) wanting them to escape the game.Negatives: not many to be honest, couple of scenes were slightly cringe, but not off putting. Same logic goes for a couple of scenes which felt dragged out.I think people need to forget about this being a remake of a classic film and treat it as a separate movie altogether. If you start comparing the 2 that's when it goes wrong.Ps.. Karen Gillan. Marry me please?Worth watching and will be going cinema for 2nd instalment.","

"Her-Excellency","7 April 2018","Who would have thought that the sequel to a much-loved classic would, in my opinion, turn into such a stand-alone powerhouse!?!Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle, does just that. Not only is it a virtual non-stop ride of hilarity and laugh-out-loud moments, and it is, but the chemistry among the adult cast members is practically flawless and lends to the easy banter and overflowing, genius, COMEDIC DIALOGUE which just SHINES. Every look, every gesture, every note from The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are perfection in that at no time do you doubt they are who they are supposed to be. Karen Gillan is adorable and gorgeous at the same time. The obvious fun they are having, despite what I imagine to be uncomfortable filming locales, is palpable, and as an audience member, _if you allow yourself to be_, you WILL be swept up and transported by it.So, why ANY low ratings?While the first Jumanji was 'fun', underneath the fun, there were dark layers. There is none of that here and perhaps, this is where some of the disconnect from its detractors comes from. Unlike the original Jumanji, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a fun, and funny, film throughout. In closing, quite to the contrary of what a couple of reviewers are saying about Robin Williams, such as: 'he'd be rolling over in his grave (over this movie)', Robin Williams was one of those rare and amazingly special individuals who found joy and humor in most everything, and who chose to share that with those of us who are lucky enough to be witness to some of the favorites he left behind. Personally, I find it in very bad taste and verging on offensive, that those who seem to not share the capacity to laugh or live the way he did, or the ability to laugh with the rest of us, and who lack the gift of both being able to give or receive the very humor which exuded from Mr. Williams, would dare say he would be doing anything other than laughing riotously while munching on some popcorn and watching this film.Thank you, Robin Williams, for the precursor which was so fantastic, it brought about an equally wonderful sequel.You are missed.","

"AlsExGal","14 September 2020","Four high school students serving after school detention discover an old cartridge video game in the school's storage area. It's called ""Jumanji"" and when they play it, the game sucks them into its world, where they each inhabit a different character: nerdy Spencer becomes Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), a musclebound action hero; football jock Fridge becomes diminutive sidekick Mouse (Kevin Hart); vacuous pretty girl Bethany becomes chubby middle-aged male scientist Prof. Oberon (Jack Black); and academically-driven Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) a sexy martial artist. The quartet learn that they have to complete the game to return to the real world and their real bodies, but they each only have 3 lives in the game; die 3 times in the game, and they die for real.I saw the original Jumanji movie back in 1995 and liked it a great deal and I was therefore dreading how a reboot would taint the memory of the original. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The dichotomy of the characters in their real lives versus their in-game personas is funny and well exploited, and the conventions of video game storytelling and set-up are also lampooned with some wit. Johnson, Hart and Black are all performers who can be over the top, but the material calls for it here, and they all exceed, as does Gillan, especially during her hilariously awkward ""seduction"" scene. Even if some of the animal peril is blatantly more CGI cartoonery, it also fits with the videogame milieu. This strictly popcorn fare, but it isn't brainless, although it's a bit predictable. Still, it was much better than expected.","

"markovd111","2 November 2019","When I saw new ""Jumanji"" movie is in the works and saw how does it look like, I was pretty irritated. I didn't see the need for it and couldn't possibly see it at the same quality and style as the first one. Expectations sank even lower when I found about the cast. And then, 2 years later, I finally watched and, surprise, it's fun. It isn't something that will make you rolling on the floor from laughing or make you cry, but it's an enjoyable ride, actors actually aren't bad and wooden, so you will find yourself grinning a lot, particularly at the male part of the cast, which is awesome, especially Kevin Hart. Watch it with a good friend or a loved one and enjoy. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not just a dumb Hollywood blockbuster either. 8/10","

"Jack_C_","24 December 2017","We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake. The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish at the beginning of the movie, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.The Rock is always fun, but shines as a scared nerd with no confidence. Karen Gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl. Jack Black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny. Kevin Hart as a shrunken jock with many assigned weaknesses is classic. All in all a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor. Worth the trip to see it on the big screen. You do not have to see the original to appreciate it. Not quite 10 stars because adult re-watch value is just not there.","

"TheLittleSongbird","20 May 2018","Will admit to not expecting much. The advertising didn't have me completely sold, was worried as to whether it would be fun or turn into puerile immaturity and wasn't sure about the cast entirely. Saw it anyway being someone who wanted to see as many 2017 films as possible, who has seen their fair share and likes films intended to be escapist fun, who loves the Jumanji premise and who has fondness for the Robin Williams film.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' turned to be much better and far more enjoyable than expected. It may not be a masterpiece or great, but it clearly strived to be glossy escapist fun and succeeded very well in that. Do prefer the earlier film but other than the title and the basic premise 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' to me seemed like its own take and should stand on its own. Can see definitely why it won't appeal, and hasn't appealed to (though on the most part have seen more positivity than negativity), some. Didn't care for the first twenty minutes or so in the real world. It didn't have an awful lot of momentum in a first act that was just setting things up and took too long to do so, was awkward at times in the writing and the acting was far more comfortable and interesting once we got to Jumanji. Most of the performances are fine once the film got going, but for me Nick Jonas was very bland and while more subdued than he usually is Kevin Hart for me sometimes grated (though at other points he is amusing), the rapid loudmouth shtick is going to be a very acquired taste. However, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' was highly successful in its aim of being glossy fun escapism. The film is two hours but once we're in Jumanji they fly by. Although the story can be extremely predictable and the outcomes not surprising, the lively energy, the exciting thrills, thrilling action and suitably nail-biting but not intensely so sense of peril more than compensates.As do the witty script, that has the right dose of humour and surprising heart and even with the profanity from Hart it doesn't ever get too crude or puerile, and ace visual effects. Jumanji is colourfully rendered and mostly the film is nicely shot and more than capably directed. The music is rousing and pleasant to listen to and the ending is cosy and surprisingly poignant, which one doesn't expect yet it doesn't jar too much. There's even a nice Robin Williams/Alan Parrish tribute/homage touch, that is worth looking for if especially observant.Dwayne Johnson smoulders in intensity and charisma, in terms of acting style it is very familiar territory for Johnson but he does it well and that's all that matters. Karen Gillen more than holds her own with the other leads, with a good deal of sass and charm (her flirting/dance scene after being taught to do it is one of the film's highlights). Bobby Cannavale is suitably formidable villain, if somewhat underused. Absolutely agree with everybody who says that Jack Black steals the show, he has the funniest lines and moments (which are plenty) and it is perhaps his best performance since 'School of Rock'. The character interplay, which the film is heavy on, really sparkles.In conclusion, fun and surprisingly good film if not a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox","

I expected it to be a nice movie, but I was so surprised by every single minute.Jack Black is at his best in this kind of comedic roles. He's hilarious in this one too. Dwayne Johnson and the rest also give a very entertaining performance.It is so much fun: I cannot stop talking about it!I did have to force myself to stop thinking about Robin Williams, for emotional reasons. This movie is a great tribute to Robin.Yes, it does have some continuity problems with the Robin Williams movie, but it's forgivable. The movie is full of action, good humor and special effects you'd wish they had back in 1995 with the first movie.'Go see it!","

"SnoopyStyle","13 March 2018","Spencer is caught doing the homework of the football playing former childhood friend Fridge. Self-obsessed Bethany disrupts a test with her phone use. Self-conscious nerd Martha insults her PE teacher. The four kids get detention and forced to clean out a room in the basement. Fridge discovers a video game called Jumanji in the basement junk. When they start it up, the four kids are pulled physically into the game. Spencer is given the avatar of Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) with no weaknesses. Fridge becomes the diminutive sidekick Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart). Bethany turns into Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black) and Martha into scantily clad fighter Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan).This is simply fun. There are good laughs. The chemistry of the four leads are amazing. The Rock and Kevin Hart have been here before. Their charisma is off the charts. Jack Black is great playing a girl and he has a great scene teaching Gillan to flirt. Karen Gillan has the quirky comedic skills in a super cute package. The only squeaky wheel is Nick Jonas. I'm not convinced of his acting skills. In that smaller role, it would be amazing to have a big cameo like Sly or Schwarzenegger. Nick Jonas is both stiff and lacking. It's a smaller role and a small problem. All in all, this is great fun for the family.","

Of course it's a twist on the original Jumanji movie that will never capture the same magic. But for everyone expecting it to be a giant flop, it ends up being pretty fun.3.5/5.

"Kirpianuscus","30 May 2019","The wrong idea - to compare with the adaptation of 1995. Because it is not better or worst but different. Proposing a decent solution, far to be original, mixing humor and adventure , using the dream of many teenagers to become the better version of theirs and a good dose of special effects. Jungle, not awful dialogues, good performances and exploration of a familiar universe. Nothing memorable. But enough for a not boring afternoon and, maybe, for the inner child. It is fun and the cast represents the basic source of seduction.","

"Jared_Andrews","23 January 2018","The steady and impressive box office success is well-deserved. This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018.  No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting.  Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. ""Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!"" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much. Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.
 
Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch). Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car ""why can't you just drive us where we need to go?"" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is. Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with ""I'm just saying you're a babe."" Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short. These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","

"Platypuschow","6 May 2018","To it's credit as you learn mid way through the film this is a sequel and not a remake. I'm thankful for this as I'm tired of the senseless reboots, seriously enough already.With a fantastic cast who are all bringing their A game Jumanji is a very generic Hollywood movie. What I mean by that is its predictible, it's flashy, it's loud and has all the usual tropes that you'd expect.Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's entirely a bad thing, at least it has fantastic production values but sadly it means it lacks in originality and has no real identity of it's own.Telling the story of 4 teenagers who get pulled into Jumanji, yet this time it's updated and has become a video game!Plenty of comedy, both hit and miss, the stunning Miss Gillan on show and Jack Black for the first time in years actually reminding us why we used to love him.It goes without saying that I prefer the first movie but credit where credit is due Welcome To The Jungle did exceed my expectations as I think I subconciously went in expecting and perhaps wanting to hate it.Nothing special, all flash with little filler. But you can do a lot worse and there are some laughs to be had.The Good:All the 4 leads deliver on every frontThe lives thing is kind of neatThe Bad:Same villian, but changed so dramatically really?!Does exactly what it says on the tinNick JonasThings I Learnt From This Movie:Jack Black was a girl in previous life","

"themovieparadise","22 December 2017","All of the performers are fantastic in this film, and are perfect fits for their roles. The group dynamics are excellent, and they all have hilarious back-and-forths with each other. Some of my favorite moments in the movie are when everyone is simply standing around talking. Dwayne Johnson really shows his comedic talents here. While he does have a few scenes where he gets to show off his action chops, most of his role is comedy-heavy, and he delivers on it. Kevin Hart plays the same character he always plays, and more times than not it annoys me, but for whatever reason here it works. Maybe it's his chemistry with the other actors, but he's hysterical in this movie. I'm not a huge fan of Karen Gillan's character of Nebula in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, so I wasn't sure how she was going to be in this. But she delivers as well. Not only does she nail the action beats (and she has some of the best in the whole movie), but she also has some great comedic moments, comedy that I didn't know she could pull off as well as she did. But the true star of this movie is Jack Black. I thought he was hysterical in the trailer, but I was afraid that the concept of him actually being a teenage girl would get old and annoying quick, but it doesn't. Black is perfect for this role, and nails every comedic moment he's given. They are all fantastic together, and it makes for some great entertainment...","

"Tweekums","30 June 2019","This film opens with the viewer being introduced to the four high school protagonists who find themselves in detention together. They are; Spencer Gilpin, an intelligent but shy boy; Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson, Spencer's friend who is a football player needing academic 'help' who are caught cheating; Bethany Walker, a popular girl who used her phone in class and Martha Kaply, an academic high-flier who doesn't see the point of physical education... or PE teachers. Once in detention together they are left alone in a room and find an old games console. The hook it up to a TV and select their characters... then they find themselves sucked into the game in the bodies of their characters. They also gain their characters' allotted skills.Somewhat inevitably their new in-game avatars are rather different to their real world characters. Spencer finds himself in the body of man-mountain Dwayne Johnson; Fridge ends up as Kevin Hart, no longer a great athlete but with knowledge that the team will need; Bethany is perhaps the most shocked when she becomes Jack Black and Martha finds herself in the scantily clad body of Karen Gillan... complete with martial arts skills. They soon meet a character who gives them their task... if they are to exit the game they are to return a gem to the statue it was stolen from. If they are to escape they will need to adapt to their new strengths and weaknesses and work as a team as they face a variety of challenges. It helps that they each have three lives but it is far from clear what happens if they lose the third... although they assume it means real death.I haven't seen the original 'Jumanji' but thought this would be worth checking out as the concept sounded fun and the four lead actors have all impressed me in the past. They may be very different but the film this made me think of was 'The Breakfast Club'; not just because it involves students in detention. Like that film it shows the characters are more than their stereotypes; something they learn when they suddenly find themselves forced to as characters very different to their own. The cast are all on great form and provide many laughs. It was great seeing Dwayne Johnson playing a slightly wimpy character and it was hilarious seeing Jack Black as a high school girl! Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan really impressed as well. The action was solid with good CGI making it look real. The villain didn't have much of a character but that makes sense given that they are meant to be in a game... all the non-player characters are comically limited in what they say and do. The spectacular Hawaiian countryside is used to great effect to make the land of Jumanji. While there are no real surprises the story is a lot of with its impressive mix of action, humour and great characters. The humour mostly avoids crudeness... even the idea of a high school girl coming to terms with her new male body is dealt with in a way that is unlikely to offend too many people. Overall I'd definitely recommend this fans of 'Indiana Jones' style action.","

"vengeance20","23 December 2017","Heard about another Jumanji Film being made, but thought it was going to be a remake of sorts. Well, through years of development it seems to be more of a different take on the 1995 classic! And a good take it was!Starting at 1996, a young man finds a ""board game"" on the beach after hearing the iconic ""jungle drums"" sound emitting from the box partially covered in sand. Like the original, he finds it, takes it home with him, & then finds out it's an Nintendo like game & plugs it into his console & starts playing, he gets sucked in & is trapped in the game, similar to the original, but as a computer games console, not a board game, interesting take.So fast forward 21 years later, & 4 young teens who all come together via detention play the game & get sucked in after finding it in a store room in the school. It's then they find themselves in different bodies & each have 3 lives like that of a computer console game. They then learn of the curse of the jungle via a green jewel & must place it back where it was & shout ""Jumanji!"".The film I thought was pretty good! Of course it wouldn't be nearly as good as it's counter back in '95, but it's pretty damn close to be an original & somewhat is! The story was simple & easy to follow, the characters were great & likable, Karen Gillan was a babe in this film! (sorry had to say it!), but she & the others were great! I also liked the humour in this film too! It was funny & fitted well!I was kind of peeved it wasn't set in the real world as appose to a jungle, but I suppose it was because they were sucked into a different world so it made sense in a way, & it wasn't too bad either!Overall this film was a good watch & matches pretty well with the original film! 9/10 Go watch it!","

"veeresh1209","6 April 2018","Reboots can be tricky. While some click, most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie. Last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like Jurassic World, The Mummy, Kong: Skull Island. But much like Spiderman: Homecoming, Jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers. 
Jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game. Four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention. Here they discover the Jumanji video game and enter the world of Jumanji as their avatars. Then starts the fun ride. There are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from Alex's freak house. The movie uses time tested cliche - Four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when (literally) seen from some other's point of view. But the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them, at least till the movie ends.The movie does not take itself seriously, and that is a huge plus point. The plot of the movie is crazy, there are man eating albino (what?!) rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side. But such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself, which makes you fall in love with it more.The bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors. All of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry. Jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters. Parts where Dwayne Johnson(Spencer) stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits. Not to mention his hilarious display of 'smoldering intensity'. Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart and Jack Blake as a women in a man's body is perfect. Karen Gillan, who is this mean Nebula in MCU, comes up with a very charming performance.All in all, Jumanji is a movie that you can watch without any regret. It will make you gasp, wonder and laugh hysterically. It is definitely worth a watch.","

"dontpanik","9 December 2017","We went to see this as part of the early screening for Amazon Prime members. I always worry that all the funniest parts of a movie are spoiled in the trailer leaving nothing left in the film. That isn't the case. I was either smiling or laughing the entire movie, as was the rest of the theater. Is it Citizen Kane? No. Was I going to the theater wanting to watch a drama that delved deep into the characters' lives? No, again.Our 4 heroes are sent to detention where they discover and are consequently sucked into Jumanji. They become the avatars they chose for the game and must complete the object of the game without using up all their lives. They have to work together, as a team. It is so much fun. It's predictable, funny, cute and the most important, entertaining. The actors are great in it, including a few cameos that were unexpected. The humor isn't too crude, but still slapstick-y and funny. It was along the vein of Shrek, Rat Race, or Clue. Again, if you're looking for deep and can't stand watching a movie without questioning everything, skip this one. This is one of those movies I'll be buying just so I can put it on and laugh.","

"mike48128","29 August 2018","In 1995, the board game ""Jumanji"" resurfaces in the USA once again. Never mind that originally it washed up from the ocean in France at the end of the first movie. It ""morphs"" into a Play Station-like self-contained video game and a teen-aged boy is sucked into it and becomes a helicopter pilot. Twenty-one years later, 4 teens get sucked into it again. This time, it is a jungle-themed adventure game with a rather-thin ""plot"" which follows silly video game protocols. Each player has 3 lives and special strengths and weaknesses, which they can view and sometimes control. Many twists and turns. The 4 ""gamers"" are transformed into new avatars. Two of them are almost ""invulnerable"". One is a Tarzan-like ""Indiana Jones"" and a gorgeous babe combining the charms of ""Laura Croft"" and Marvel's ""Black Widow "". Both can perform impossible leaps and bounds, like superheroes. A nerdy girl turns into a boy nerd (Jack Black). All are chased (and some are killed) by dangerous jaguars, ""man-eating"" hippos and rhinos. One gets blown up by explosive food, jumping to their death, etc. All are restored by their extra lives. Much ""tame"" mostly non-graphic video game violence, no cuss words, and the ""feeling"" that everything will turn out fine in the end. They are helped along-the-way by various ""guides"" and the magical powers of a luminous green gem that creates evil and yet returns everything back to normal when it is returned, similar to ""The Temple of Doom"" concept. Uttering the word ""Jumanji"" ends the game. The original player returns to his own timeline and so does everyone else. ""Jimanji 3"" is planned, and I don't really see a reason for it as the game is destroyed at the end of this movie. Perhaps magic or cursed things are ""immortal""? Look for ""Jumanji 3-The Search for More Money"" (my title) in 2 years.","

"ThmellyAthole","8 April 2018","I used to have an IMDB account when I was a teen - or at least thought I did, but couldn't log on. In any case, I think I've visited here maybe twice in the last five years. Today though, after just getting back from watching this with my almost-grown kids, I had to make an account just to leave this review.To begin, I'll never understand people. I can't believe the negative reviews. How could anyone not have laughed like hell while watching this and still have a pulse? I didn't go in expecting much, but I came out with a smile on my face. The girl is hot, Jack Black ""owns it"", I've never been overly enthused about Kevin Hart, but he was fantastic. and The Rock just knocked it out of the park. I saw one review which reads: ""not a wrestling fan ever so to see 'the rock' in movies, instantly puts me off!"" Does anyone else want to vomit at the inanity, irony and ludicrousness of that statement? Then you have the user who out of 40+ titles he/she has reviewed in the past has only ever rated TWO above three stars. Seriously, if you don't enjoy films and find them so terrible, find a new hobby already. You've got one guy saying the shirt one of the kids wore was outdated. So, I'm guessing one can only wear clothing depicting the current year? Then you have the reviewers who maybe didn't understand the dialogue since they can barely communicate correctly themselves (such gems - I kid you not - as: 'averege'; 'what so ever'; 'family fair' (fare); 'are just wasn't'; 'due to it has'; 'all of there' {their); 'coz it is boring story'; 'no compare with'). Finally, you have the maybe half dozen reviewers who are so caught up in their bigotry that they can't relax and enjoy a film if it isn't whitewashed and who complain about the ""Hollywood liberal agenda of diversity"". Leave the politics at the door, man.
In short, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle was a fantastic hour or more of rip-riding fun and laughs.Except for one very funny moment, Dwayne Johnson retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead, provides a smoldering and intense performance, riddled with good-natured hilarity as the lead in this film. Gillan was great in Doctor Who, and although I thought she was the weakest of both characters and actors in this film, she still held her own and looked fantastic doing so. She has one of those faces you can't help but love. Kevin Hart was fantastic as the diminutive valet and looking back, I think he was somehow involved in every funny moment in which I laughed the hardest. Finally, the master, the maestro (though I never really was a fan prior to this), Jack Black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection.10/10 and definitely a film I will be purchasing right after I click ""Submit"". You can never have enough laughter in life, and Jumanji, Welcome to the Jungle delivers barrels-full.","

"damianphelps","7 March 2021","I will admit from the outset I was concerned about this. The original Jumanji is pretty incredible and I was worried that the use of The Rock may distract from the clever elements of the film.
To The Rock's credit it doesn't. You clearly notice him in it but he doesn't overpower the film.The sidekicks are a big part of the success here, it allows for more depth and humour to be spread across the film.The should be proud of the effort here in building a new legacy and not diminishing the original.Fun for all :)","

"davispittman","31 December 2017","I'll start out by saying that my family is a really big fan of the Robin Williams/Bonnie Hunt Jumanji movie, I personally thought it was alright. Nothing great, but not bad either. I went into this movie with my doubts about it's quality. One, because I wasn't the biggest fan of the original, and two because I was fearful it would just be another generic action romp. I was WRONG. This is one of the best action films I've seen in some time, and there are many reasons as to why this one works so well. Reason number one: the casting. This cast is just perfectly put together. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson really was great in the lead role, one of his best performances in my opinion. Kevin Hart serves as the ever hilarious comedic relief, and he did a fabulous job of making the audience laugh their asses off. Jack Black is really great here as well, very funny, really the best middle aged man in Hollywood you could pick to play as a teenage girl stuck in another body. And lastly, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas give fun entertaining performances. The acting is a big plus for this movie. Reason number two: the writing. The script allows for many things: comedy, action, and some serious stuff too. Funny lines for the comedic heavyweights and more touching/sweet content for when it's called for. And finally, reason number three: very exciting action and effects. The action scenes are done well and achieve the level of excitement that they are going for. And the visual effects are top of the line as well. Overall, this is just a great film overall, and it even gave a small harken back to the original 90s film. Great lovable characters, exciting action, skilled writing... just a joy overall. 9/10 for Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle.","

"MajorMAlice","13 March 2018","I would say I gave it a 10 to balance out the bobo-heads with no funny-bone in their body's low scores, but no; this movie deserves a 10 and more. Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a stand-alone, HILARIOUS romp which leaves the original in the dust. Heck, HILARIOUS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. Note that this is not to say that the original Jumanji was bad. On the contrary, it was great, especially for when it was filmed and who better than SIR Robin Williams, but in terms of laugh-out-loud good fun and non-stop smiles, this Jumanji far outpaces and outdoes the original. While my BF and I have somewhat different tastes in movies, and he is not a Rock fan (he loved him as a wrestler, not so much as an actor), we both laughed SO MUCH while watching this. The Rock knocks it out of the park with equally stellar performances by Jack Black and Kevin Hart. What is even more fabulous is that it has kids humor, yes, but also 'thinking-people's humor' in the form of obscure little tidbits which are dropped here and there and keep you on your toes and grinning ear-to-ear. There is hardly any scene where you step out of the roller coaster ride of fun it sets you on from the moment they (and you) are IN Jumanji.Do yourself a favor. Watch this, and if you don't laugh raucously at LEAST six times, seriously, consider what else might be wrong. In fact, if you read through some of the negative comments, you see the same old, bored, stagnant people complaining about it being ""too PC"", AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. Cry me a river. If you notice these people's other reviews, it is easy to see that anything that they consider too scary (read: progressive) to fit in the mold of their little minds and world, automatically gets relegated to the 1/10 pile. Shame.In closing, this Jumanji gained a place within my favorite movies of all time, and the only thing which makes me sad about it, is that 1. I wonder if upon a fourth viewing (we saw it three times) through my 20th it will lose some of its luster; and 2. that it wasn't much, much longer, as I did not want the fun to end.","

"DarkVulcan29","29 December 2017","A delightful follow up to the 1995 film that starred the late great Robin Williams, comes the new film 22 years later, I really like the way it let's the audience know that it is a sequel and not a reboot. It 's joyfully adventure basic a send up of Indiana Jones and Lara Croft films. But the characters really stick together, that is what makes the film fun to watch. Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan , Kevin Hart and Jack Black play there parts very well, has teenagers who get pulled in a video game , and our in the bodies of the characters of the game. Jack Black steals most of the scenes has a teenage girl trapped in the body of a man. Villians here look like cast offs from a Mad Max film, but are still fun to watch. It's not totally a kids film, there are a few adult jokes put in. I really was entertained here, it's not a masterpiece but just a fun time, and sometimes that is all you need. So go in this expecting nothing more or less. I believe video game fans will find this a fun time.","

"regula1","8 December 2017","The original Jumanji was supposed to be a one-and-done film, even though it teased the potential for a sequel. Many voiced trepidation at the prospect of a sequel after all these years later, and after the tragic death of original star Robin Williams, there were valid concerns about whether this sequel could be both a good movie and a fitting sequel and tribute to what had come before.I am glad to report that it fulfilled all expectations.The film relies almost entirely on its star power, and it has that in spades with the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. Where the charm resides, though, is the actors playing against their types through the means of real-world to video game body switching: The Rock embodying a nerdy hypochondriac, Hart an all-star jock, Gillan a shy insecure reject, and perhaps most brilliant of them all, Black housing a she's-all-that pretty girl. Together our four teenage protagonists get sucked into the video game incarnation of Jumanji, a jungle land that is threatened from the typical video game threat, and our heroes must do the usual video game tasks in order to beat the game and return to the real world, all without getting killed in-game, which will get them killed in real life after three lives.The film thematically treads the same sort of ground that other teen movies tend to cover, mainly the stereotypical high school tropes get thrust into a situation that forces them to work together to correct each other's flaws and by the end they return to their 'normal' lives as better people.What the film does different in the body-switching is that these tropes are transferred onto adult actors, people who each have tropes of their own, and the way that each actor gets to play against their type is definitely what makes this movie so fun.On the flipside, like a video game, the villain is very one- dimensional, and while the narrative isn't necessarily harmed by it, it does stand out as something that's lacking, wishing that the villain was more than just 'I will kill you because reasons'.Also, the character introductions in the real world at the beginning of the film feel very forced, as in we all know they end up in the game, and the reasons they get into the situation feel very convenient, as if the writers could not find an elegant means to get these four people in the same place in front of the game console at the same time, so they just threw them all together.These are fairly minor nitpicks, as the pace of this film is fast, it doesn't really drag at all, and while they do repeat a joke or two, it doesn't step over the line into annoying. All this makes for a very fun film, definitely worth your time this holiday season, and after once it gets released on home media.","

"ThomasDrufke","23 December 2017","Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is easily the best video game movie ever made. Everyone who follows movies even remotely knows that's not a hard task to complete, but Jumanji earnestly gets that title from me by being self-aware, armed with charismatic performances, and an undeniably fun and energetic tone from beginning to end.The second pairing from Kevin hart and Dwayne Johnson comes as way of a sequel to the classic 1995 film, Jumani. Instead of just rebooting a beloved film 20 years later, this installment does feel like a standalone film, but in more than one way, it honors the legacy that began with the Robin Williams led film in the 90's. What better way to do that than get The Rock and Hart to team-up again for an adventurous action-comedy. Their chemistry, along with Karen Gillan and Jack Black are quite the team. Luckily, the film doesn't rely too heavily on Hart and Johnson's funny banter from Central Intelligence last year. Each character had their own arc and I didn't feel as though any one particular character was put in the background.Did I approve of all the character choices and humor? Certainly not. Jack Black is a naturally funny guy, but I wasn't too fond of his portrayal of a popular teenage girl. All of the characters are stereotypes obviously, but for some reason that character rubbed me the wrong way. Gillan on the other-hand, was much more in her comfort zone than it seemed like she was in the Guardians films. Her range of playing a scared and vulnerable young woman to be a ""dance fighting"" bada** was a joy to watch, and playing off of Johnson may have even superseded Johnson and Hart for me.Like everyone else, I was very skeptical of this film for the last few years. What was the need to go back and try to recapture the spirit of the first film? Well, they reinvented the wheel without replacing the entire car. Using video games instead of a board game seemed like a cheap trick, but it ended up being the best decision the franchise could have made. Where do you go from here? Well, it now seems the possibilities are endless. In all, a well-rounded cast, endless energy, and a little heart go a long way with this one.8.6/10","

"rockman182","22 December 2017","The original Jumanji is a nostalgic film from my childhood. It still held up when I rewatched it earlier this month. The effects aren't the greatest but the film was fun and had a lot of heart. I was not one of those annoying people who had pitchforks out when they heard about Jumanji being rebooted or getting a sequel. Always give a film a chance, that's what I do. After seeing promo pics and trailers I was hyped. I like The Rock and Kevin Hart working together, and also love Karen Gillan. The film looked like a fresh spin on the original and even looked like an effort that wanted to stand on its own. It does exactly that. Say what you want, this is a very fun film.Four different teenagers are given detention and once there they discover an old video game named Jumanji. They plug the game system in and are sucked into the world of Jumanji, primarily in a jungle where they must return a jewel into an enormous Jaguar statue. Sounds easy, but the jungle is filled with tricks and traps and wild animals. Oh yeah, the four characters become the characters in the game physically. This makes for a very entertaining time with almost non stop humor on top of its adventure.The actors do very well in this. Jack Black and Kevin Hart bring the comedy. Jack Black's character is actually the embodiment of a self absorbed teenage girl, and he plays that remarkably well. I dig Kevin Hart with his loud commentary. I also love that he's always getting knocked over thrown around, in the way of danger, or in this films case- explodes. All the humor in this film comes at you tenfold and it all works. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat and, while somewhat predictable its never boring. The action scenes are gripping and grand scale. I loved the world of the film and the connection between the characters.The film has a few nods to the original but the film is still quite independent from the original which is nice. Really its in name alone; the connection to the first. Overall, its a blast at the end of the year. Its a re-watchable and exciting comedy/adventure. Take off your critical lenses and actually sit and enjoy this. The negative things I'm reading about this are analyzing it on such a deep level. Dude, relax and enjoy.8/10","

"pal05052003","19 December 2017","Jumanji 2 is a hilarious, fun, escapist, adventure movie starring The Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. Using video game rules, the movie truly brings video game magic to the screen, and subtly pokes fun at the action genre. The Rock is great as usual and has a literally huge presence in the movie. The chemistry among the cast is great, and the Rock proves once again he is the go to guy if Hollywood wants to revitalize a franchise, though he has yet to prove he can fuel an actual franchise by himself. As for Jack Black and Kevin Hart, both provide great comedy to an already comical The Rock. However, Kevin Hart's character is more interesting than Black's and therefore wins the crown for best comical character in the movie. Karen Gillan is stunning, and kicks ass, though she is not given much else to do. The movie has great sweeping shots, and over the top action, but all of this makes the movie plausible, given the premise that the characters are trapped in a game world. Recommended for all to watch","

"peterp-450-298716","3 April 2018","""I think we got, like, sucked into the game.
And we've become the avatars that we chose.""I was sure about one thing. A remake of ""Jumanji"" is the same as repainting the Mona Lisa and exhibiting this copy. Ridiculous, inglorious and unnecessary. I was afraid this movie would be ridiculed and laughed with. And on top of that, they've asked Dwayne Johnson to join. Not exactly an actor you'll see in what they call the ""better"" films. I thought it would be something like ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" and that I would curse the makers afterwards, because they dared to copy a milestone with the late Robin Williams starring in it. For once, however, I have to admit that I was wrong. It's been a long time since I've amused myself so much while watching a movie.In the original movie, it was of course Robin Williams who took care of the humorous part. And also the inhabitants of the jungle (with some bad looking computer graphics) who stirred things up in town, were kind of fun. In this movie nobody really stands out. They are all hilarious. And this because of the fact that the four main characters (who are being sucked into the game) are totally the opposite of the in-game character they've chosen.During a detention these four totally different students discover this dust-covered Jumanji game. This well-known game has been tranformed into an oldskool console game (well, they had to keep up with the times). Spencer (Alex Wolff) is a spindly little boy, plagued by all kinds of allergies, who looks rather clumsy and timid. Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) is an immense athlete. Bethany (Madison Iseman) is such a typical blond teengirl who thinks she's the centre of the universe instead of the sun. Martha (Morgan Turner) is the shy type. Again the same stereotypes you'll see in a film about an American high-school.It becomes really funny after they have been transformed into the characters from the computer game. Maybe too predictable but still hilarious at times. The schmuck suddenly sees how his biceps have grown. The stuck-up, smartphone-addicted instagram bimbo notices to her horror that her perfectly streamlined teenage body is trapped in a chubby, male body. The timid girl is suddenly a duplicate of Lara Croft and to her surprise she has knowledge of certain combat techniques. The well-built sports fanatic gets a rather submissive role as a dwarfish male with a backpack.Now get ready for the big surprise. The most hilarious role is played by Dwayne Johnson. That was really the last thing I expected. And of course Jack Black provides some humorous moments. Although the male genitalia are the main subject here. And the part where Karen Gillian has to learn the art of seduction, I actually was laughing my head off. And finally, a small remark. The pilot in the game (who's the long-lost teenager) looks a lot like footballstar Eden Hazard!But not only the interplay and the witty interactions convinced me. I also thought that the cleverly put together concept of a video game, was a brilliant idea. The NPC's that showed up here and there, the cut scenes and the way the participants return to the game (after which the tattoo on their arm suddenly changes) are all elements you can experience in a game. In other words, this film scores extremely high in terms of originality. On the one hand, the film ""Jumanji : Welcome to the jungle"" is an extension of the original film. But on the other hand it's also a stand-alone film (with only one reference to the original flick). So I have to admit that I am pleasantly surprised by this film. And even with Dwayne Johnson in the lead. There are no more certainties in this life !","

"justin-fencsak","8 March 2018","When Jumanji leapt from book to screen in 1995, it became a hit loved by kids and their families like me who saw it at the Loews in Wayne. Robin Williams, fresh off hits like Aladdin and Mrs Doubtfire, delivered a performance for the ages. An animated tv series soon followed. Then Robin Williams passed away. Soon, it was time to reboot Jumanji for a new generation hooked on 3d games. Thus, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was born. The character that Williams played, Alan Parrish, is honored in an homage during the beginning of the movie. The main cast is excellent, with Karen Gillan, hot off Doctor Who and Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as Kevin Hart and Jack Black along with Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. The Rock, in his biggest hit of his career since the last Fast and Furious movie. The special effects are just as good as the original movie, and there's tons of pop culture and video game references in this film that is still playing in theaters while making its digital HD debut this week with a physical release in two weeks. You don't have to watch the original Jumanji in order to appreciate this film. Game on!!!","

"lunalovitt","8 April 2018","When I first heard they were making a reboot of Jumanji, I was skeptical. These days it seems like everything is getting a half-assed reboot or spinoff so when I went in to watch this movie I didn't expect anything life changing or original. And I was shocked with the results. This story was actually GOOD. It took the original concept that was Jumanji and made its own twists and turns and didn't actually butcher the original source. And I really enjoyed all the characters as well, which is something I couldn't exactly say about the original film. I was so surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie that honestly I find myself wanting to go back and re-watch it. When it comes to movies starring comedians, I don't really get very hopeful about the content and quality of the movie, especially these days when ""comedians"" turn out to mostly rely upon profanities and slap stick more than wit and actual humor. However, the jokes in this movie were on point and I really enjoyed Kevin Hart's performance as well as Dwayne Johnson's. They played well off one another and it wasn't over the top. And wow... I really did think Jack Black had hit the high point of his career back in Kung Fu Panda and was on the down slope, but he was easily one of the best parts of this movie. The casting for this movie was great overall.
 
Not only that, but this movie was more than the typical ""comedy"" movies you see nowadays that are all about getting drunk/spitting out as many curse words in a sentence as possible/being ""shocking"". There was a serious plot behind it with actual stakes and it played its serious moments very well. All of the characters went through important evolutions that were believable by the end of the film. Now, it wasn't perfect. There are things that were a bit off in terms of continuity and if you know the first Jumanji then you might see where I'm getting at, but it wasn't enough to take away from the film itself. Overall this was a very enjoyable movie and I'd definitely watch it again. The movie was a tasteful update to the Jumanji franchise, and to be honest I'd love to see if they have plans for a sequel. I'd certainly watch it given how well they treated this movie.Then again, I did watch Pitch Perfect 3 in the same night as this one, so this positive review might be a little biased when taking in both movies side by side in a short period of time.","

"subxerogravity","22 December 2017","I've seen the original movie once or twice as a kid but don't recall it well enough to do a comparison.I do love the update of Junmanji adapting itself to a video game over a board game (but I do know lots of kids who still play board games). This was the second time Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart teamed up in a movie together. The first being Central Intelligence, though you can't go wrong with a little Hart and one big Johnson, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a better fit for them than Central Intelligence, even without Hart and Johnson's help from some star power like Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas.So just like with the original film, a few kids find some old game and begin to play it, only to get sucked into the game they are playing. Keeping with the video game tone the kids become the avatars they select. So this kid name Spencer, who in real life is a little nerd, gets to become The Rock, who plays Dr. Smolder Bravestone, not much of a doctor of anything but he's got strength, speed, and no weaknesses, so like I said, he becomes the Rock, and what kid does not want to become the Rock, right? (hell I'm a grown man and I want to become The Rock)Not all the other kids are as lucky with the avatars they randomly selected. 6 feet tall high school football star, becomes 5'3"" Kevin Hart, who plays Moose Finbar, and acts as Bravestone's weapons holder. Not that being Kevin Hart, who is funny and rich would not be cool, but not really something I've dreamed about, but it could be worse, you could be Bethany, a cute and shallow teenage girl who picks the avatar Shelly Oberon, who happens to be a fat middle age man. Some of the best laughs of the movie do come from Black playing a girl discovering the advantages and disadvantages of being a dude.Then we have Karen Gillan, as the avatar Ruby Roundhouse, a total jab at the female stereotypes in video games, a hot chick who can kick butt, but is not wearing enough clothing, which makes the user Martha uncomfortable.The movie is all about what it would be like to truly live out the game as the characters treat each adventure like a level in the video game and have to overcome these adventures without loosing the three lives they are given.It does not make for much character development. Each person comes into the game with with certain issues that seem to be what the film was going to focus on, but the whole thing went by too fast to be of any substance.This new Jumanji works on the pure star power it has as we watch The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black interact with each other as they play the game. It's worth it for that and that alone","

"bob-the-movie-man","21 December 2017","In 1995, Joe Johnston (""The Rocketeer"", ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") directed ""Jumanji"" - a quirky, fantastical and dark film starring the late, great Robin Williams that got a rough critical reception at the time of release, but was embraced by the public and has gone on to be a modern classic. So when it was announced that a sequel was in the works 22 years later, my first reaction was ""Oh no... is nothing sacred?"". It's fair to say that I went into this flick with extremely low expectations.But I have to say that - given this low base - I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually quite a fun fantasy film that I predict that older kids will adore. Initially set (neatly) in 1995, a teen - Alex (Nick Jonas, of the Jonas Brothers) unearths the board game Jumanji where it ended up buried in beach-sand at the end of the last film. ""Who plays board games any more?"" he scoffs, which the game hears and morphs into a game cartridge. Cheesy? Yes, but no more crazy than the goings on of the first film. Back in 2017, four high-school teens - geeky Spencer (Alex Wolff, ""Patriot's Day""); sports-jock Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain); self-obsessed beauty Bethany (Madison Iseman); and self-conscious, nerdy and shy Martha (Morgan Turner) - find the game and are sucked into it, having to complete all the game levels before they can escape.But they are not themselves in the game; they adopt the Avatars they chose to play: Dr Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson, ""San Andreas""); Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart, ""Get Hard""); Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan, ""Dr Who"", ""The Circle""; ""Guardians of the Galaxy""); and Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black, ""Sex Tape"", ""Kong""). Can they combine their respective game talents - and suppress the human mental baggage they brought with them - to escape the game?There was a really dark time-travelling angle to the storyline of the original film - the traumatic start of Disney's ""Flight of the Navigator"" was perhaps also borrowed from the concept in the book by Chris Van Allsburg - and an attempt is made to recreate this in the sequel. The first film rather pulled its punches though in favour of a rather Hollywood ending: will this be the case this time? The film delivers laughs, but in a rather inconsistent fashion - it is mostly smile-worthy rather than laugh-out-loud funny. Much fun is had with the sex change of Bethany's character, with Jack Black's member featuring - erm - prominently. The characters all have strengths and weaknesses, like a game of Top Trumps, and this also entertains. But the most humour derives from the ""three lives and it's game over"" device giving the opportunity for various grisly ends, often relating to the above referenced weaknesses. Given the cast that's been signed up, the acting is not exactly first rate although Karen Gillan shines as the brightest star. But ""it's not bloody Shakespeare"" so ham-acting is not that much of a problem and the cast all have fun with their roles. Dwayne Johnson in particular gets to play out of character as the 'nerd within the hunk', and his ""smouldering look"" skill - arched eyebrow and all - is hilarious. Rhys Darby, looking so much like Hugh Jackman that I had to do several double takes, also turns up as an English game-guide in a Land Rover, and Bobby Cannavale (""Ant Man"") is Van Pelt, the villain of the piece.There has been much controversy over Karen Gillan's child-sized outfit. But she is clearly a parallel to the well-endowed Lara Croft, and young male teens didn't play that game for the jungle scenery! She is meant to be a hot and sexy video game character, and man - does she deliver! Gillan is not just hot in the film: she is #lavahot. This makes her comic attempts at flirting lessons (as the internally conflicted Martha) especially funny. Hats off to her stunt doubles as well, for some awe-inspiring martial arts fight scenes.Fans of ""Lost"" will again delight in the Jumanji scenery, surely one of the most over-used film locations in Hawaii if not the world!Where the film gets bogged down is in too much cod-faced philosophizing over the teenager's ""journeys"". This is laid on in such a clunky manner in the early (slow!) scenes that the script could have been significantly tightened up. And as I said above, the script - written, rather obviously, by a raft of writers - could have been so much funnier. Most of the humour comes from visually seeing what's happening: not from the dialogue.Directed by Jake Kasdan (son of director and Star Wars/Raiders screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan) it's really not half as bad as it could have been or as I feared, and I would gladly watch it again. For it's target audience, which is probably kids aged 10 to 14, I think they will love it. And, unlike many holiday films, the parents won't be totally bored either (especially the Dads, for the obvious misogynistic reasons outlined above!).","

"tk-to-dj","10 December 2017","Jumanji 1995 has many memorial moments for example: The reveal of the Jumanji board, monkeys robbing a police car, the stampede, sinking floors, the flooded room with some crocodiles, the incredible use of the sound track, basically a lot of stuff. The original is well crafted and now it's 2017 and we have Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It's a fun, action comedy film with really cool references to the first film but as much as it entertains me it's not Jumanji. As Robin Williams said ""I've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares"" but in this film the jungle is safe enough to make margaritas and have scented candles on display. Dwayne Johnson tries to play a geeky character but he still plays that big tough guy. Kevin Hart plays himself nothing new, Karen Gillan plays a geeky shy girl and she has done that before and finally the highlight of the film is Jack Black playing as a teenage girl named Bethany. Everything Jack says is incredibly funny and will leave you falling off your seat. Like I said before it's not Jumanji, 6.5/10.","

So if you are a big fan of the Jumanji with Robin Williams in it, this may feel weird at first for you, but if you can get over it, you will have quite a decent movie to enjoy watching.The effects are good, the characters are fun and while it might be a bit too weird and off at times, this still is entertaining enough to hold its own. It's a nice ensemble of actors and they all have something to add to the story. Some cliches will be served, but you always have that. It still has some nice touches for fans of games, which is a nice treat.","

Also it was actually surprising that Kevin Hart was funny in this, for real I would tend to skip his stand up shows since they are unfunny so yeah.I'm not gonna waffle more no sense remarks on this movie, just watch it, you'll definitely like the amount of action that went into it!!!","

If you are a guy wanting to bring wife/girlfriend to movie you'll both walk out feeling you got your money's worth then this is a great pick. It won't win any fancy awards but best movie in theaters right now.","

"msbreviews","8 April 2018","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This is one of the best surprises of 2017, simply because no one expected this film to be this funny and entertaining! While the original movie has its moments, it loses itself in its silliness and nonsense. Jake Kasdan's installment proves to be a well-directed remake/reboot/sequel/whatever with a hilarious screenplay and a fast pacing (plus a cool score).Nevertheless, without this cast, it wouldn't be as good as it is. The fact that everyone (except Kevin Hart) portrays an anti-type character is itself remarkable. Watching a beast like Dwayne Johnson play an easily scared kid or Jack Black acting like he is a young teenage girl trapped in a middle-aged man's body is something that I never thought I needed until I actually witnessed it. Karen Gillan also does a fantastic job and Bobby Cannavale, unfortunately, is just portraying a villain who shows up once in a while, for a few seconds.Still, the film has its narrative flaws and two of them are arguably plot holes. The CGI sometimes is too noticeable and it bothered me a little. Basically, if you are able to accept or ignore the story's lack of logic on some details, you are in for a hell of a ride. It's entertaining from beginning to end and it even has some unexpected emotional moments, so if you need to watch an adventurous comedy with some friends at home, watch Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. You are not going to be disappointed!","

"masonsaul","12 December 2019","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a surprisingly incredibly fun sequel/reboot. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas are all incredible and the film is consistently funny throughout and hilarious at certain parts. It's well paced and the direction by Jake Kasdan is great, resulting in lots of enjoyable action sequences. The music by Henry Jackman is really good. It's only brought down slightly by Bobby Cannavale being wasted in a one note performance as the villain.","

"joshbarton15","9 December 2017","Jumanji is a film I grew up with so it'll always hold a place in my heart. It's by no means the greatest film ever made but it is a film I never thought would need a sequel, the very idea being a product of the lazy Hollywood cycle. To do a sequel to Jumanji, you have to be brave enough to evolve the franchise and not just rehash it all, which is exactly what they did with Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.When four teenagers get sucked into the video game Jumanji, they become their chosen avatars; Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black), Franklin Finbar (Kevin Hart) and Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan). Together they must play along and finish the game to stand any chance of getting back home.The evolution of Jumanji from board game to video game is one of the sensible ways that the creative team bring us a sequel two decades after the original was released. It's the only way the kids of today would ever play it so to see the game itself change to attract new players makes sense. The idea of a sequel after all this time is one that left me skeptical however, thanks to a changed concept of the story taking place inside the game rather than the game coming to the real world, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle quickly became a sequel to become interested in.The changed concept is one that leads to a good old-fashioned adventure romp full of action and plenty of fun for the entire family. The idea of the kids being sucked into the game and being forced to play it out as characters totally opposite to their everyday selves makes for an amusing watch, the raucous laughter from the audience being a telling sign.No one is having more fun here than the four leads of the film mind. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan all make Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle such great entertainment; Johnson milking it while playing a nerd trapped inside the body fit for an action movie star, Hart revelling in the big guy trapped in a small guy's body role, Black stealing the film as the Instagram obsessed girl playing as an overweight professor, a role he seems so suited for, and Gillan bringing the fierceness when she needs to as Ruby Roundhouse a.k.a. the ""Killer of Men"" which, as you've guessed, is so far away from her character back in the real world. You get a sense that working on this set would have been so much fun.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle works as a continuation of the Jumanji franchise, even if there are people out there who are adamant it won't. It's the perfect kind of film to take the family along to and I can guarantee fun will be had all round. It was much better than I was expecting and I'm ready to call it the biggest surprise of the year.","

"MovieCriticOnline","5 March 2018","It is so cliche and formulated. Every note is so carefully (overly) crafted. You say this and then you say that. Everything feels wooden, inauthentic. The original wasn't great, but fun entertainment and stuck to the book. Each character is a millennia caricature with ""cutesy"" moments they spent months writing. I didn't see one spontaneous moment in the entire film. They took the cast of Breakfast Club and stuck it in Jumanji. And they made sure they got every racial representative in there, not because the original books had it, but because they wanted to get social justice.I feel as annoyed by forced social justice racial diversity, as I would if they remade the Cosby show with Asian, White and Hispanic actors.The acting is just so bad. The mediocrity that people seem to enjoy today is astounding. The movie made ZERO sense, so they made sure they explained it, laying it out in lazy expositions.When you have to explain everything, your writing is poorly done. Show -- don't tell. The CGI was horrible.","

"jon.h.ochiai","24 December 2017","I really enjoyed ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"". ""Jumanji"" is way more than its movie trailer. Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan are awesome. The Rock embodies a genuine ""nerd' charm in his action hero persona. It's nice to 'see' Karen not hidden behind the Nebula visage of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". I'm a fan from her short lived series ""Selfie"". Gillan is beautiful, beguiling, and comedic charm. Jack Black as Shelly the gender swapped avatar practically steals the show illustrating the movie's surprising message. Game avatar Shelly, who's real life persona is ""it"" girl Bethany, schools now stunning Martha (Gillan) how be attractive to men. Shelly says, ""You're hot. Now own it."" Black offers comic relief in the video game mayhem as Shelly confesses to Smolder Bravestone (Johnson) and diminutive Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart) that having penis makes it so easy to pee. In the touching narrative arc, as their avatars in ""Jumanji"" Martha tells Bethany that she is so self-absorbed, consequently totally so selfish. Bethany tells Martha that she judges people first, before they have chance to hurt her. Director Jake Kasdan surprises not so much with the light hearted large-scale action with Johnson and Gillan kicking some ass battling motorcycle villains commanded by Bravestone's arch nemesis Van Pelt, played by ruthless vile Bobby Cannavale. Rather his poignant message in this video gamer movie is: Be who you are. This is amazing given that the screenplay based on the book, ""Jumanji"" has screenwriters Chis McKenna, Erik Sommer, Scott Rosenberg, and Jeff Pinker. Usually having that many writers inevitably generates kluge. Instead they are often touching. Young Spencer now The Rock's Bravestone has been in love with teen iconoclast Martha, now Ruby Roundhouse, since 7th grade. Both Johnson and Gillan are the most beautiful screen actors in paradox as Spencer says, ""I'm a nerd."" Martha says, ""I like nerds."" Bravestone fears death realizing that he only has one game ""life"" remaining in ""Jumanji"", doubting if he can save his friends and return the magical green jewel to the Jaguar statue. His friend Finbar, played by Hart, reminds that in the real world, ""We all only have one life."" So do your best. That's what anyone can do. Johnson is amazing movie star swag and gentle introspection as Bravestone. Hart is nervous comic energy as Finbar. He tells someone about his avatar's weakness, ""Cake makes me explode."" Don't often hear that one. Hart is also all heart. Their partnership along with Gillan and Black are about seeing others as greater than they know. In the end that's what makes you become. And perhaps, the hero arises from within. ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is derivative of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"". 
""Jumanji"" does not aim to be as iconic, although it is about: Who you are? Who are you going to be? Young Spencer, Fridge, Bethany, and Martha, played convincingly by Alex Wolf, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman, and Morgan Turner, all enter the video game ""Jumanji"" as who they are. Perhaps, they transform as greater. Really that's up to them. Director Kasdan invites you along for the ride with cool martial arts and gorgeous locales. Go along for the ride. The ride is well worth it.","

"bettycjung","1 January 2018","1/1/18. Ok, i'm going to say that this was pure fun and extremely enjoyable to watch! I can't say that for too many movies these days, but this one will have staying power until everyone looking for a fun movie have had a chance to see it! Johnson, Black and Hart were all in fine form, at their best, and Gillan was a pure surprise. I am sure we will see more of her in the future. This is truly one of the FEW remakes I can recommend to see. It's not exactly a remake-remake, but a theme in variation. I have not heard so much giggling in a theater audience in a long time, it kept ALL viewers young and old engaged. When was the last time you can say that of any movie? Go see it!","

It's honestly more of a movie about 90's videogames, and if you played them a lot like I did, you'll love this film. Karen Gillan was the only weak spot of the entire film, but I assume she didn't have many lines because of her Scottish accent, but she is a great actress who was criminally underused. The one Jonas brother did a great job as the Seaplane pilot, I was pleasantly surprised.Highly recommend this film, it's definitely great holiday fare.","

"Leofwine_draca","19 November 2019","A lot of the goodwill surrounding this reboot/long-time-coming sequel is thanks to The Rock, who gives an exemplary - and very funny - performance as a nerdish teenager trapped in a hulking action man's body. The rest is merely so-so by Hollywood standards, but at least it's inoffensive and fast-paced, so there's little to dislike. Just not too much to love either.Compared to the original JUMANJI, this one has been updated a little to the video game era, and I did like the old nod to Atari. The plotting is one of the worst things about this, with a generic, barely-glimpsed villain and random action scenes utilising barely-impressive CGI animal effects. Of the cast, Kevin Hart is quite funny, but I found Jack Black bland and Karen Gillan to be completely out of her depth; the obvious doubling in every one of her fight scenes also gets to be a little much.","

"kuuk3","8 December 2017","Saw via an early Unlimited Screening. Its no Oscar contender, but for a comedy adventure family film; it fulfils its purpose. None of the heroes use guns, although they do snap necks. They also show several deaths with blood splatter. So not for the squeamish. There are also scenes of bugs entering ears which can be off-putting.The teenage high school drama and love story is cheesy, as is the school bully / loner story arc. Its nothing we have not seen before. But it sets up the character traits and once were in the Jungle, it gets a lot better. It feels a little short, and some scenes like the Transporter Hanger was suppose to hard, but the lack of bad guys didn't make much sense. Every scene appeared to have been written to serve each characters death in turn. From eating cake to walking alongside a cliff. Trying to keep track of who had how many lives left let you predict who was going to die next. But it was at least trying to show character growth with each plot point and establish how these people change which is something I suppose. Removing the staples from magazines before recycling was nonsense. But that's the level of thought that had gone into the writing process. But again, its not trying to win any Oscars and is up against Star Wars in the cinema (whose stupid idea was that?) so I doubt its going to beat it at the box office. But once were in the game, its a fun, adventure film with four strong comedic actors doing what they do best. It excelled at its goal and is worth watching on the big screen.","

"TheMovieDiorama","24 February 2018","If someone said to me ""Luke, there's a Jumanji sequel coming out..."" I would've laughed and shouted ""Objection!"". Yet, here we are and guess what? It doesn't suck! The same concept as the original but substituting the board game with a retro video game from 1996. Four students are magically transported into the game where they must place a jewel at the head of a jaguar mountain in order to save Jumanji. Fortunately the creators didn't rehash the exact same idea, instead they implemented a modern twist to it. That is the sequel's strength, deconstructing how video games function. Back in my youth when I aspired to be a video game developer, I self-taught all the elements into making a game. NPCs, avatars, levels, respawning etc. so their inclusion in this felt like a little nod to me which brought a gleeful smile to my face. This re-imagination focussed on comedy and action, the fantasy traits from the original have been put to one side. Whilst the comedy is hit and miss (mostly miss) and the action is plagued with CGI...I was still entertained. Jack Black was the standout as he portrays a girl in a middle aged man's body, had me laugh quite a few times. Dwayne Johnson was likeable as ever, but then again so were everyone else. The differing character archetypes and the ""you can be whoever you want to be"" moral felt extremely forced and all too familiar. Include the plot linearity, pointless antagonist and lack of pop songs (honestly, would've been more appropriate than an original musical score) and you have yourself a good film. Not great, but highly watchable. Maybe that is just what audiences needed, to which I cannot complain. A pleasant surprise is how I would describe this. Was just waiting for Guns N' Roses to play...waited patiently...the film was ending in its incredibly cringeworthy eye rolling way...and...YES! Credits song! Luke was happy.","

I didn't even know she was in the movie. I don't think you can really compare it to the original because they are so different -- the first one was more dark & not as much comedy, but I love them both. If you have not seen the original go back and watch it. Enjoy.","

"phubbs","6 April 2018","Welcome to the jungle...really? Is that the best they could come up with? How many movies have used that in one way or another now?So at the end of the first movie (in 1969) the board game Jumanji was thrown into a river by Alan Parrish; 26 years later (1995) its somehow ended up in France apparently. Fast forward to 1996 and the board game has once again been discovered...but back in America? (I trust that wasn't supposed to be the same beach from the first movie). Anyway the game has somehow evolved with the times and is now a videogame console; and once again it lures another unsuspecting youth into its jungle themed clutches. Fast forward again to 2016 and four students will also discover the board game which will trigger the same things that happened before. And round and round we go.So I gotta admit that I liked the idea that this mysterious game can somehow evolve with the times. Back in the first movie (1969) it was a board game to blend in with the era. Now its a videogame console which of course is perfect for this era. The whole idea of the protagonists choosing a game avatar to play as which then turns out to be their live action avatar once inside the game is pretty cool (although 'Red Dwarf' did it first). This does inevitably lead to very stereotypical characters which is deliberate...but doesn't excuse the stereotypical teenage protagonists which wasn't deliberate I'm guessing.Yeah so the teenagers, they're a straight 'Breakfast Club' type bunch for sure. You've got the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the weirdo. So yeah its a complete rip-off. I really felt like they could of done better with these characters despite the movie being full of deliberate cliches and stereotypes. As for the avatars they are also rather cliche, naturally. The Rock is of course just playing the same character he always does, basically himself. Jack Black is the squat, spectacled, old fashioned looking professor type. Kevin Hart is the goofy sidekick type. And Karen Gillian is Lara Croft essentially.One thing that did get me thinking was the in-game characters, the baddies and the in-game guide. The in-game guide and various baddie henchmen all seemed to act like actual videogame characters on rails. In other words they don't interact with the protagonists on a personal level, they just do and say what they were programmed. But some henchmen and the main villain (Bobby Cannavale as Professor Van Pelt, same name as the big game hunter from the first movie) seemed to not do this. It did seem like Van Pelt behaved differently and not in a programmed way like the others, almost as if he were a real person. Now in the original movie we never saw the jungle in the game, obviously this time we do. Alas its not really been visualised that well in my opinion. I always had the impression the jungle was set in an old fashioned British colonial type era mixed with a bit of 'Tarzan' type fantasy. Like the exterior of the board game indicates. Of course as the game evolved so did the interior jungle it seems. This unfortunately has led to all sorts of modern crap turning up like military choppers, motorbikes, modern guns and weapons, ridiculous chase sequences, and lots of explosions. Now I'm sure some people will have liked these elements but for me it totally ruined the entire feel of the movie, or at least the look and feel I was hoping for.Gone is the possibility of quaintness and charm, enter vast CGI chase sequences on-board a military chopper (being chased by man eating CGI rhinos. Why didn't they just shoot them?). Stupid chase sequences with hordes of motorbike riding bad guys. Lots of gunfire, explosions and of course the obligatory martial arts sequences from Ruby Roundhouse. I might add that Ruby Roundhouse spends lots of time trying to learn how to flirt and act sexy to distract some bad guys, but ends up just kicking the crap out of them. Her entire character is utterly pointless, why did we need all that shit when she can just beat them up. Its like one sequence where The Rock's character says he knows CPR but doesn't actually do it when its required. He just stands there and gives instructions to another character, eh??Its really such a shame that this movie went down the route it did. Obviously there was gonna be CGI involved, obviously there was gonna be greenscreen involved, but Jesus Christ could they not do any better than this?! Most of the CGI is bad, real bad. Most of the greenscreen is obvious, real obvious. In fact it gets noticeably worse towards the end in my opinion. There are barely any practical effects which the first movie did incorporate in places. This movie is just ugly from top to bottom and its not helped by all the ludicrous action sequences. Its like half the movie wants to be like 'The Phantom', and the other half like 'Rambo'. Its such a clash of genres and tone.There is also a large plot hole in the way this story works, I think, unless I missed something. In the original Alan Parrish goes back to the point where he started playing the game in 1969 and changes time. This is obviously meant that Judith and Peter would never have played (in 1995) and wouldn't know anything about the game or Alan (having never met him). In this new movie the protagonists meet up with the kid (Alex) who got trapped in the game from 1996. When they all leave Alex goes back to the point he started playing in 1996 and changes time. So if he changed time, how come the four main protagonists still remember everything when they get back to their present day of 2016? Surely there's a chance they would never have ended up playing the game, or the game wouldn't have ended up in the school (?).Anyway once again I find myself completely mystified by a modern movies success. How on earth did this pile of crap make so much money? How on earth did people find this enjoyable?? I could maybe understand it if this was an original movie and the first had never existed, but it does exist! I simply cannot fathom how anyone can accept this utter garbage after the excellent original movie (complete with a terrific Robin Williams) which came out back in 1995. There are some neat little touches here and there, I like the evolution and mystery of the game, and Jack Black is always a pleasure. But apart from that, this was yet another cookie cutter Dwayne Johnson flick. CGI laden trash of the highest order.3.5/10","

"ZCDomingos","26 December 2017","I'm going to be honest, at first I really didn't consider watching this, specially because I watched the first one and I feel in love instantly. I mean, these days sequels to a 20 years old movies or reboots aren't that great, and I'm not that stingy with reboots, because I just want to watch a movie and not compare to the original one, I like watching it as a standalone. But with these one, I was so worried, but oh man, I love to be wrong in these situations.
It was brilliant, I was not feeling the modern version of Jumanji, but that was cleared in the beginning and it didn't bothered me that much, actually. The characters were amazing to watch, mostly because I easily related to them if I was in that situation with my friends. 
The plot was good enough, nothing new and unique, but it was well planned and cohesive, and that's one of the most important aspects of a plot. 
The game theme was so well written in this movie, and once again super cohesive and it follows it's rules, which demonstrates excellent writing and not just ""for a moment in particular alteration"". The cast was phenomenal, even though I liked The Roch way more before, it was still pleasant to watch him in a different role, actually more funny and interesting than I want to admit, and the rest of the cast I was already in love, specially Jack Black, who killed this performance alongside Kevin Hart and Karen Gillian (who I never watch before, but I'm already in love).
This is a perfect family adventurous movie, you don't have to watch the first one, but there are easter eggs in this sequel that are so special to those who enjoyed the first one, like me.
Give it a go, I can't promise you'll love it, but to me it's good entertainment","

"MichaelNontonMulu","20 December 2017","Well this movie was exactly what I would hope for in term of comedic situation and provided us a good amount of laugh. In fact what my wife and I noticed was the movie was a lot more comedic than adventurous. This was a bit different from the movie's predecessor, the 1995 version of Jumanji which felt having more adventure. Apart from being a sequel to that movie, this one also served as a tribute to Robin Williams who played the lead character of Alan Parrish. From my personal view, the original movie was something that truly blow my mind with the obviously awesome special effect at that time and also a wonderful experience seeing so many animals came and wreak havoc in the city. While in this movie, the characters were the ones who went inside the game and the animals scenes were not that frequent.The movie seemed to focus on the characters development and chemistry which were fun to see. I actually loved Jack Black's character whom I think was totally spot on. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson seemed to hit it off very easily, most likely because they had played in an action comedy movie earlier Central Intelligence. Meanwhile Karen Gillan was totally different from the other roles that I had seen earlier as she provided few funny moments, with the funniest one relating to 2 bad guards. What I loved the most was the high school students were transformed into totally different adult persons and had to adjust themselves with their transformation. Though this also provided some rather crude jokes which probably not understood by young children. The special effects were definitely a lot better than the 1995 version (especially if you see the old one now). During the almost 2 hours duration of the movie, my wife and I had plenty of laughs and for me personally, I was happy and satisfied watching this one as it provided me with the light pop corn movie where I do not have to overthink and just enjoy it. Btw, there was no end credit scene in the movie which was rather surprising as I thought (and hoped) there would be one.Anyway, if you are looking for a fun, light, comedy adventure movie, then you definitely should see this one. If you have seen the original movie, you might also enjoy this as it had the aura and some scenes that would remind you with that one. It would be best if you have seen the original movie first before seeing this one to really appreciate and understand it better. And please do not expect a heavy logical movie where you need to over analyze it. Just go to the cinema and experience the fun.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id","

"MLDinTN","13 July 2018","One thing for sure nick jonas is such a terrible actor, I don't want to see him on screen. Anyways, this movie is about 4 teens that get sucked into a video game. In the game, their characters are complete opposites of their real selves. They must solve the mystery of the island and return this emerald to the top of some peek. Like a game, they have 3 lives and learn to use death to their advantage. Along the way, the meet, Alex, played by nick jonas, whom was a teen that went missing 20 years ago. He has been stuck in the game, not able to advance. There is some crazy CGI I can only assume meant to look video game listic. Like stampeding rhinos, attacking hippos, a den of snakes, driving a bike over impossible terrain. The tone is kept light hearted, trying to be funny at times.FINAL VERDICT: I think this is geared for 12 year olds, just too silly for me to say it's worth watching.","

"alessandrowoodbridge","24 December 2017","I would watch this movie two more times at least. This was a very funny movie. Arguably one of the best performance Jack Black has done. When I watched this with my family, in a packed movie theatre, I kid you not, the entire cinema was laughing during quite a few of the scenes. The humour is excellently tailored to the audience and is a beautiful tribute to the original Jumanji with Robin Williams. The way it fantastically coincides with the original movie and moves onto a sort of sequel to this is beautiful, and a rare thing these days. The movie is very funny and easily one of the greatest movies to have come out this year. It is certainly in the top 15 movies that have come out, post 2010, accompanied with the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool and now the recent movie that just came out, Bright. If you felt that Bright was also under-appreciated by movie critics, the exact same thing has happened here as Jumanji is a 100% gaurantee, a movie that will be appreciated after watching. Personally, I would watch it again and again with people. It is not just a movie to watch and discard, this is one to put on the bookshelf and watch again in the future. Loved it. Thank you for such a great movie with a fantastic and fun cast who clearly have great chemistry on and off the screen.","

"hiraishinnojutsu","21 December 2017","Start with a slow pace, this move gave me the same movie experience when I watched Geostorm (2017): it's so boring, that in the middle of it, I just want this movie to just skip to end credits already. even when I saw the trailer, the movie just wasn't too promising, and man, I've never been feeling so wrong when I decided to just give it a go despite the former reason. the first Jumanji movie (1995), though not a masterpiece, was at least likeable to the point that it became almost the entire today's twenty-something's childhood. This movie almost do nothing but insult that beautiful legacy by just existing as a sequel no one even asked before (almost like the female version of Ghostbusters did (2016) to the original Ghostbusters (1984), and thank god I didn't watch the former on the theater, otherwise I just banged my head to the hardest and the thickest wall many times until I felt I had unwatched it). Sure the jokes make everyone laughs (and I hate to admit that I laughed few times too), but not all the jokes are the good jokes worth laughing out loud for. I'm pretty sure some of the viewers decided to use a cringe expression to some of the jokes, especially the ones that included male's vital organ as the laughing material. The action scenes were not good either, I mean, to the overall scenes, it feels like they were sinking very deep in the bottom of the ocean in the middle of a vast sea of talking, jokes, drama, and any other kind of unimportant moments. some of the moments with the cgi (and the plot) makes me think this movie should have been made into a tv series instead of a 2-hour long movie that ends up as a one of the year's worst movie ever set foot on the big screen (though I don't think many people would like it either). so, in short, all I was saying can be put in this one sentence: not even the comedy trio Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson-Kevin Hart-Jack Black can make this movie interesting to watch from beginning to end.","

"anselmdaniel","18 January 2020","This review contains spoilers.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fantasy adventure comedy movie that premiered in 2017. The movie is directed by Jake Kasdan, produced by Matt Tolmach, and William Teitler. The story is written by Chris McKenna. The movie stars Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. The movie is a successor to 1995's movie Jumanji. Jumanji which was once a board game becomes a video game that traps school students that play it. The students must work past their differences and cooperate in order to beat the game and win freedom.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a pleasant surprise. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has interesting concepts and execution. The movie became interesting to watch simply because of the ideas it has that represent video games on movies. This is not a video game movie but rather a movie that is based on concepts found in video games. There is still a plot that is akin to movies and the movie uses this to good effect by lampooning concepts found in video games. A running gag in the movie is that non-playable characters simply repeat lines. This is used to good effect by the characters being introduced to non-playable characters not replying to what the players throw at them.The plot of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is basic. This movie has four students that become trapped that ultimately has to solve the mystery of why a student went missing years before. There is not a villain in this movie. There are only obstacles that the students must overcome that are present in the video game they become trapped in. The movie serves these concepts of obstacles well as the characters of Spencer Gilpin, Bethany Walker, Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson, and Martha Kaply have to overcome their differences in order to escape the video game. The actors that play these characters' avatars do an admirable job in the roles. They portray the underlying characters well and it leads to hilarious events in the movie.The movie does have some missed opportunities. I felt that the movie's plot was so basic that it could have been expanded for comedic effect. There are many tropes in video games that could have applied to this movie that are relatable by the audience. If some of these events were shown like a fog-of-war effect or a rendering limit, it could have been fun seeing the player characters see this limitation.I would recommend 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'. This is a solid movie and it serves as more of a spiritual successor to 1995's Jumanji movie.Grade: B","

"hjalsayegh","23 December 2017","Movies about video games have the worst rep in movie history. Add to that this being a sequel and has Jack Black in it as a teenage girl... yeah I was expecting something intolerable with it.It starts off lame as expected. A bunch of walking stereotypes all get a contrived reason to have detention together where they find the game and start playing. This leads to the first continuity error of the movie, The game turned into a gaming cartilage when the 90's kid ignored it at first. kindda off it's version of keeping up with the times. When the other kids come across it, it's a console.make no mistake the first 15-20 minutes of this drag like hell. once they're in the game however it's a 180. I totally buy that they are avatars of those same teens. the ""game"" is very straight forward and easy to grasp from the get go with the movie being more about the character's development then anything else. They started off paper thin but the movie played it up nicely, the visuals were fun and... I can't believe I'm saying this but Jack Black was actually funny in this!There is a tie in with the original but it's subtle and I liked how the ending was faithful to how the original ended. This was fun movie for the family. it started at ground zero but made you care about the characters and get invested in it as it went on. 8.5 stars and a recommendation from me.","

"TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","29 March 2018","In the months leading up to the release of 2017's ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"", pretty much all you could hear was moans and groans from the collective film-going audience. People were upset that the beloved 1995 Robin Williams classic was getting a sequel. Purists were infuriated that the movie was updating the treacherous game for modern times. Online commentators couldn't get over co-star Karen Gillan's laughably skimpy outfit and took pot-shots at the movie over it. This is one of those films that just couldn't catch a break.Yet, something happened. Early reviews weren't just solid- they were absolutely glowing. A slew of sneak-preview screenings garnered extremely positive feedback from audiences. And when the film was finally released, it earned a near-unanimous acclaim. For a film that just couldn't catch a break, ""Welcome to the Jungle"" became a welcome and fantastic example of that old saying ""never judge a book by its cover."" Everyone was so wrapped up in pre-release drama and accusations... we just never considered that it might have not only been good- it might have actually been better than the original.Twenty years after the original adventure, a group of modern-day high school students all find themselves stuck in detention for varying reasons. Neurotic geek Spencer (Alex Wolff), meat-headed football star Anthony (Ser'Darius Blain), awkward loner Martha (Morgan Turner) and self-obsessed popular-girl Bethany (Madison Iseman). While sorting old magazines for recycling, the group discovers a mysterious video-game entitled ""Jumanji"" and boot it up, only to find themselves magically pulled inside of the game. Now occupying the bodies of the characters they chose (Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black), the troubled teenagers must complete the game's objective and solve increasingly difficult ""levels"" in order to escape. Along the way, they find a new ally in Alex (Nick Jonas), a long-lost kid who has been stuck in the game since 1996, all while being tracked by the game's villainous baddie Russell Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), whom has attained control over Jumanji's animal kingdom.The greatest treats of ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" are the playful and creative tone the story takes, and the excellent cast who have a grand time hamming it up for the camera. Co-written by Chris McKenna of ""Community"" fame, the script is an absolute blast and a half that both pays tribute to the original film while also taking the story in interesting new directions. The idea of Jumanji transforming itself into a video-game to attract modern teenagers is actually really clever, and it keeps the sequel fresh and unique while still remaining true to the original. There's also a ton of really fun meta-humor that fans of modern games will absolutely adore. I really got a kick over how the secondary characters can only speak a few specific lines over and over, in a playful nod to how video-game NPC's usually only have a handful of programmed responses. And the uproariously funny fact that Gillan's aforementioned skimpy outfit is a satirical swipe at how games often objectify female characters. (Like I said... never judge a book by its cover...)This is aided quite well by director Jake Kasdan's keen eye for visuals and sharp sense of pacing. The film's action set-pieces are genuinely thrilling, the humor is well-delivered and there's almost never a dull moment to be had. Kasdan has honed his skills throughout the years with some delightful projects, including the woefully underrated ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"", and here, that experience pays off in spades. And I can't wait to see what he does next.But perhaps the films greatest achievement is the absolutely outstanding cast. Particularly Johnson, Hart, Gillan and Black, who get to play against type and seem to relish in this in each and every moment. Everyone knows Johnson is one kick-butt dude... so it's a lot of fun seeing him playing the role of a neurotic teen whose allergic to just about everything. Gillan often plays sexy side-kicks or treacherous characters, which makes for a good contrast when she's playing an uncomfortable weirdo who can't talk to guys and doesn't like to be noticed. Hart's an absolute hoot playing a giant linebacker stuck in a diminutive body. And Jack Black... my god, Jack Black is outstanding as a popular teen girl stuck in a middle-aged man's body. He gets the biggest laughs of the film, and wisely never plays the part too broad. He's just perfect, perfect, perfect.It's a genuine surprise just how much fun this film is. I know as a 90's kid myself, I had my standards set high and thought nothing could come close to the original. And I was very pleasantly shocked when I walked out of the theater and realized that in many ways, ""Welcome to the Jungle"" is better than the original. It's sharp. Exciting. Hilarious. It really is the perfect continuation. Sure I could nit-pick the fact that the villainous Van Pelt is a bit under-developed. And I could argue that a few of the effects don't quite work. But on the whole... yeah. If you loved the original, I can't imagine you wouldn't love this stellar sequel just as much if not more.I'm giving ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" an excellent 9 out of 10 for its sheer, infectious fun-factor. Definitely go in with an open mind and give it a shot. Because take it from me... no matter what pre-conceived notions you might have, it'll defy your expectations in the best of ways!","

"nogodnomasters","31 December 2017","This is a sequel to the original film and not a reboot. Having watched the first film is not necessary to view this film. In fact not seeing it may be more helpful. In this film four students in detention get sucked into the game and must complete the game in order to return home from the jungle. What made the film good was the characters. It was a ""Breakfast Club"" type of thing where four teens discover themselves and overcome their fears and shortcomings to form a winning team. In the transformation they become opposite characters from what they are in real life with the self absorbed Bethany becoming Jack Black. The film had humor, action, drama, and a feel good ending. Take the family. Guide: No f-words, sex, or nudity. Worst on-screen kiss for 2017.","

"ratari","22 April 2018","When I saw Jumanji in 1995 Starring Robin Williams, I was immediately swept away . It was non-stop action and fun. It was exhilarating. It was a wild entertaining ride!Now we come to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017). What can I say?
I like all of the actors. Special effects were great. That's where it just comes to a slow boring, dying, disappointing halt. A few jokes were funny, I'll admit. A good action, comedy HAS TO KEEP YOU OFF BALANCE! That is a must. You have to feel like you just don't know what surprise is around the corner. It has to keep you on the edge of your seat, so to speak and it has keep you laughing. This film did neither. As I have often said, timing is everything in a movie. Dead spots are taboo. A well written and well edited film keeps it moving with constant, ongoing discovery.
This was more like a committee got together and decided to ""get a few throw pillows and some paint and make a movie"".
It felt like each scene was painfully contrived by amateurs. Too many dead spots.Most reviewers here thought it was great. I have to respectfully disagree and go against the grain. I make no apologies.","

The sequel is a little different with it's successor, with the theme is still same, a game that involved real adventures to it's player. Four teenagers sucked into the game, and they become a character they chose (which is very different from their real life). The movie is so funny, and if you played RPGs game you will find this really entertaining. The humour is still suitable for young audiences, so it's a family movie too. And while it's a humour adventures movie, it still have a good message. So I really recommend it, hope you'll enjoy it too.","

"kirbylee70-599-526179","29 March 2018","Back in 1995 a movie came out that featured a board game as its centerpiece. Starring Robin Williams the movie told the story of a boy with a secret that is sucked into the world of the game only to be released years later when two more children began playing the same board game. When word came out that the movie, treasured by fans around the world, was being remade those fans were not quite sure what to expect. Rest easy because JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is just as wild, just as adventurous and just as much fun as the original.But no one plays board games these days right? The movie opens in 1996 and that's the case when a young teen named Alex tosses the board game aside to play his video games. The next day he looks at the case again to see it is now a video game, begins playing and disappears from this world.Fast forward to the present and a group of 4 teens are sent to detention. Spencer, the class nerd, and Fridge, the star ball player, are in trouble for Spencer doing Fridge's homework. Bethany is a self-absorbed young girl who lives on her cell phone, so much she had it on during a test. And Martha is a self-styled outcast sent here because she argued with a teacher. All are there for Saturday detention and instructed to clean out a storage room. But they find the old Jumanji game, hook it up to the TV and begin playing only to be sucked into the game just like Alex years ago.When they arrive in the jungle it takes them a while to realize what is going on. Spencer is now a muscle bound adventurer and played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Fridge is his sidekick and responsible for carrying a backpack with his weapons and played by Kevin Hart. Martha has turned into a fighting machine ala Laura Croft and played by Karen Gillian. And Bethany is now a knowledgeable professor played by Jack Black. Once they acclimate themselves to their predicament a transport arrives to pick them up.Driving the vehicle is Nigel, in reality a part of the game who is there to pass along information to the group and set them on their way. He tells them the story of an evil adventurer and Spencer's rival Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) who stole a famed jewel from the eye of a jaguar statue plunging Jumanji into darkness. Their task is to retrieve the jewel and take it back to be replaced in the statue. But there are several tasks involved along the way just like any game requires.Each learns about their strengths and weaknesses before they set out. They also find out the hard way what the stripes that seem to be tattooed on their arms mean. Each one is a life they have while playing the game. Lose a life, lose a stripe. And when they're all gone, its game over for that person.The thing that makes this film work is the interplay between the actors on screen as well as the alterations in their characters from the real world to the world of Jumanji. Spencer's 180 change has him looking at his arms and amazed at how big they are. Martha can't figure out why she's wearing such skimpy clothes in the jungle. Fridge can't believe he's little more than a sidekick. And Bethany bemoans her frumpy appearance and the loss of her much loved cell phone. But they all adapt while teasing one another about their changes.The acting from all four is wonderful to watch. For me Jack Black has always been hit or miss and he hits in this role, especially when he has to go to the bathroom. Gillian gets a chance to shine after her makeup laden role in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. Hart and Johnson, so amazing together in CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE, are just as good here. Johnson in particular shines in his comedic moments, especially when he gives a smoldering look.The effects are solid here and almost all CGI. But they're done well enough that it doesn't matter unlike some films that rely on those effects while doing them poorly. They play well into the story here and that story is solid enough to make you realize this isn't a remake so much as a reboot of the original.I found myself laughing throughout the film as well as cheering on the team making their way through the game. While there are a few jokes that adults will enjoy more than kids, they're not the sort that will be offensive and have you trying to explain them to the young ones. All in all I had a blast with this one and odds are I'll watch it again. My guess is you will as well.","

"danjamz","11 December 2017","This sequel took so long to come to fruition, the most unbelievable thing is that the writing could still be so bad. It genuinely feels like they cast the actors first, then wrote supposedly ""cool and funny"" scenes about them, making it feel more like a bunch of unconnected sketches and action sequences than a real story.The main problem is that the humour seemed almost entirely aimed at the handful of young kids in my (very busy) screening, they loved it of course; but literally everyone else... silence for the entire movie. The special effects are fine and the action sequences exciting enough, but without a half-decent story to hold it together, it all feels a bit empty. Ultimately keep your expectations rock bottom and you can probably just go along for the ride. But 22 years after the original, I would highly recommend you give the old one another try before you bother with this.","

"MihaiSorinToma","19 September 2018","Four very different teenagers are sucked into a video game and transported to the world of Jumanji. Each equipped with an unique set of skills but also weaknesses, they must find a way to finish the game before remaining out of lives in order to go back to their own world.It's a movie which follows about the same concept as the original flick, but also improving it in terms of visual effects. The four new characters are very likeable and funny, playing their part very well in the adventure that follows. Their evolution as teenagers and their relationship with one another is also presented in detail, presenting how each is able to overcome his condition with the help of the others. Their part is the most important, very well played by the actors, contributing decisively to the outcome. Using plenty of references to video games, this movie manages to create a very entertaining atmosphere in which the action can take part. Speaking of which, we have plenty of it, exaggerated of course as they are part of a video game, but still very enjoyable.The plot isn't much as far as the game is concerned, but it is good enough to keep it all together and make it a very good all-rounder. It's not predictable or linear, even having a mystery to be guessed, but it's not breath-taking either. It excels though through dialog, character complexity and development, making it very good in this department. The visual effects however are top notch. It truly is a delight for the eyes to see all the action sequences and all other events which are made possible using CGI.It's a movie which I truly enjoyed. It manages to create a good time for its viewers, while having some great actors who play their characters with style. It's not spectacular in terms of story but it makes up through action, suspense, CGI and even a bit of drama. A very good watch overall.","

"BA_Harrison","28 December 2017","I wasn't expecting anything from Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle other than some light-hearted Hollywood escapism, and that's exactly what I got: a couple of hours of pure popcorn entertainment with a predictable message to be comfortable with who you are and make the most of your life.A sequel to the original 1995 film (not a remake!), the film sees four high-schoolers tasked with cleaning up a classroom, where they find an old video console, loaded with a cartridge: Jumanji. Setting up the game, they each take a controller and choose a character, after which they are sucked into the world of Jumanji, where they become their avatars.Nerd Spencer (Alex Wolff) becomes musclebound adventurer Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson); meek Martha (Morgan Turner) becomes kick-ass babe Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan); shallow beauty Bethany (Madison Iseman) becomes middle-aged, overweight cartographer Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black); and jock Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) becomes short zoologist Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart). To escape the game, the players must work their way through the various levels and return a jewel, the Jaguar's Eye, to its rightful place in a huge statue.Aimed at the whole family, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is equal parts action and comedy, and largely succeeds in both areas, with some great gags (Jack Black, for once, manages to be funny and not throughly annoying) and several well-mounted set-pieces, the best of which involves a stampede of rhinos and a damaged helicopter. Of course, things work out exactly the way you imagine they will, but although there are few genuine surprises, the film still manages to be quite the thrill-ride.","

The concept was different from the original yet with one scene they tied it into the first movie. They brought it into modern times with their digital twist. Watching the Rock and Kevin Heart and Jack Black play teenage opposites of themselves was hysterical. It was action packed and suspenseful enough to hold the attention of adults but not too much where young kids would be too scared to enjoy. My two young kids, husband and I enjoyed it and had a great family movie night!It's definitely a movie I'd watch again.","

"Aaron1375","26 December 2017","First off, I was not the biggest fan of the first movie with Robin Williams. It was not bad, but just did not click for me. When I first heard about this film, I had no desire to see it; however, when I saw the trailer and saw that it was now a video game and the people became their avatars I thought I would give it a go. Suffice to say, it was a rather amusing and action filled adventure that I was not disappointed in at all. Not the best film I have seen all year, but still rather good. I figured the whole video game setting would make it more enjoyable for me than the whole crazy stuff happening in the real world setting of the first film. The film is a mixture of comedy and action as I would say it is nearly a 50/50 split with maybe a dash more on the comedy side. The cast all did a good job as the actors and actress playing the avatars within the game all were able to pick up on the teens who they supposedly were traits very nicely and made up a lot of the comedy in this film. The story has the Jumanji game found on a beach. A young man picks it up and opens it up, but immediately dismisses it and goes to playing video games. Something happens within the night and the board game becomes a video game and soon the young man disappears. Years later, a nerdy guy, an athlete, a popular hot girl and a bit of an awkward girl get detention. They are charged with cleaning out a room, but happen across the video game Jumanji. They soon decide to play and each of them is plunged into the game and become the avatar they have chosen. The nerdy kid is now a brave and muscular explorer. The athlete a small and diminutive zoologist and backpack carrier. The awkward girl becomes a very attractive and hot video game heroine and the popular girl becomes an overweight professor and reader of maps! They are charged with getting a strange jewel back to where it belongs; however, they have limited lives and seemingly unlimited dangers awaiting them in the jungles of Jumanji. They have to cross the dreaded jungles, get through a bazaar and try to outsmart the villain of the piece and try to stop themselves from being killed in the process! The actors in this all do a really good job as they make the film. If not for the way they act, this would be kind of just another generic jungle action piece. Dwayne Johnson continues to be a solid actor and still the best wrestler turned actor as he has to play a guy who looks huge, but the actual person being a very insecure and scared individual. Karen Gillian does a really good job at being super hot and sexy, but also extremely awkward. Kevin Hart is very funny, but the actor that stole the show was Jack Black as the professor who the popular and self absorbed girl became as he actual seems like he is that girl. They all are what make this movie extremely good and funny. The villain though is bit of a throwaway, almost seeming to be no threat at all. So I enjoyed the film, at times I thought it did get a bit too serious and I did think it ran a bit long, but overall I really enjoyed it. I think it is the only non comic film I have seen so far this year at the theaters other than John Wick 2. The first film just was not for me, but I enjoyed this sequel quite a bit. I do classify it as a sequel and not a reboot as it is just a new setting as the game itself has evolved over time to become something new. The actors were great and though the ones playing the avatars are in the majority of the film, the ones playing the 'real' them were really good too. The film had a mixture of comedy and action, but though it was nearly even I would still say that at its core it is more of a comedy film. It was a nice change of pace and I enjoyed watching it with my parents and they enjoyed it as well so well done to Sony for making a very enjoyable film.","

"Paragon240","2 January 2023","The sequel no one saw coming or expected to light up the box office as it did! Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun adventure film with hilarious characters that works in every way. I will be honest; I was not a fan of the original movie - it freaked me out as a child. But the new film minimized the horror elements of Jumanji and focused more on adventure and humor. This time instead of a board game, Jumanji has morphed into a video game that sucks its unsuspecting victims into its deadly world. Welcome to the Jungle leans into all the video game tropes with hilarious results with jokes about skills, lives, NPCs, boss battles, and more. The movie is at its best with all the humor surrounding the body-swapped teens dealing with the game's characters they now inhabit - the skinny nerd becoming the muscular hero, the jock becoming a tiny sidekick, and the funniest of all, the pretty popular girl becoming Jack Black (who is the real stand out of the film). Jumanji is a must-see family adventure film that brings fun and laughs to everyone who dares to play the game.","

This movie is so funny and barely anything compared to the 1995 version! Such a crazy adventure that seems to have a high budget, I guess that's ok sometimes better than most Transformers films. Very cool concept especially since I'm a gamer and the director Jake Kasten is awesome, I like a fair bit of his projects.

It builds on the original movie, but it can stand on its own, and the film creates a new set of obstacles for the heroes to overcome. Plus, it features plenty of action and plenty of laughs.

A very good fantasy as well as adventure comedy movie.I remember an old jumanji movie of 1995 but this one is far better than that.The movie is about the four kid who accidentally found an old game that took them into the world of game and full of quest to perform. Gamers will find it very exciting as these four kid runs through different experiences and missions to keep them alive. The movie moves forward along with the same pace of the game and finally reveals it's final stage.The actions are quite acceptable. Some comedy scenes are very very amusing. Dwayne johnson has done really well along with his other three companions.This is not a serious type of movie at all. So please don't watch it seriously.Rather seat and watch it for fun. You will get lot of this from it.","

I am not a fan of ""Action/Adventure"" or ""Comic Book Movies"". So I was shocked that I loved this movie. At the beginning I thought ""Oh It's The Breakfast Club"" stuck in a fantasy world.Now I will say ""That is still partially true"" but what this film is rarely hits a false note. It was lots of fun with a huge heart.Set twenty-one years after the first film, the plot follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji, playing as the characters they chose. They must overcome the game's magical power in order to win and return home.If you are looking for a film to see (It hits DVD Soon) then make this your top choice.","

"jtindahouse","18 March 2018","'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is a surprisingly well made and well executed film. I'll admit I had very little hope for it going in. I wasn't a big fan of the original and I'm not a big fan of Kevin Hart's brand of humour. I had almost no anticipation for the film whatsoever. It started out a little slowly (there's maybe a 15 minute period before the big stars actually come into the movie), but after that it kicked into gear and was a very fun two hour ride. The set up for the film is done perfectly. The lull at the start is completely necessary and makes every thing so much better later on. Knowing who these characters are before going into the game compared to what they become once they're in there is the best thing the film has going for it. Jack Black's character arc in particular is especially hilarious. In fact in what was an incredibly strong performance by the entire cast Black would have to be my stand out. Dwayne Johnson continues to be Hollywood's most improved comedian. Compare what he achieves now to his work early in his career and it's worlds apart. These days he's almost becoming a sure sign of quality. Kevin Hart was the surprise for me. I rarely enjoy his work, but here he was hilarious. Whoever wrote his one-liners did a fantastic job. They were almost always effective. The whole movie is just put together very well. The three lives per character structure was very clever and allowed so much freedom for the story to progress. Also I loved that there was no mucking around with the aspect of getting them into the game. They're in quickly and boom, the fun can begin. Too many films draw this process out in an attempt to be clever or create believability. I would happily recommend 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' to anyone looking for a good laugh and a fun time.","

I love the movie and the Jumanji 2017 movie is really fun, especially the characters and many funny scenes that make me laugh until my popcorn scrambling. Dwayne Johnson can do mimiques of face like a teenager. The plot is ordinary, about to conquer a quest of game, but the adventure is never boring. I appreciate the Director of Casting who can search the faces of all actors similar to the faces of game characters, this is miraculous.The only weakness that I found in Jumanji 2017 movie is that the core story itself: how can people get into the game. This is super imaginative and that part also makes us curious about the game business with the question of such: ""can we really doing game like in reality?"" and if yes, ""could we comeback?"" The final scene is also quite fiction for me, but I hope Jumanji 2017 movie can be an eternal movie like Home Alone or Air Buddy and every time we watch it, never boring.","

"thepriceofpayne","16 December 2019","""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is actually a welcome surprise from a studio who's had some franchise issues recently. The film works as a semi-sequel, homage, and reboot of the Robin Williams classic, and successfully makes an entertaining adventure featuring wonderful performances from Karen Gillian, Dwayne Johnson, the scene stealing Jack Black, and Kevin Hart (despite the fact he's playing himself). This film is a fun and exciting Jungle adventure that will give you just the right amount of nostalgia while also creating something new and inviting, even if the writing can be standard at times.","

"pensman","7 January 2018","I like Jack Black but he's running his niche character a little thin. He made King Kong (2005) bearable, and was perfect in Tropic Thunder, and I liked the semi-serious turn in The Holiday. Here like in most of his films, he helps with the comic turns but in an usual way that almost makes this his movie. Kevin Hart plays Kevin Hart. The Rock likewise plays the Rock. In this turn the game is amped up to being a video game but you know the drill. It's a pretty much mindless romp that I would have waited to see on HBO or Netflix but that a friend had passes. I guess I am tired of CGI and loud booms and plotless films. I suspect if you are under thirty you will enjoy this and have some laughs but the studios are really pushing Jumanji to the breaking point but I'm sure they will squeeze another film out of this franchise depending on the profits. I am beginning to wish Hollywood would start on the road to bankruptcy already with the endless repetitions.","

"scifi-97852","4 December 2018","I'm going to be flat honest, I went into this movie expecting not to enjoy it. It's a sequel 20 years later to a movie I really, really loved. And not to mention that Robin Williams made such a huge impact on my childhood and has sadly since passed, meaning anything anyone did would have to ultimately be compared to his original work, I expected to be tearing this movie apart.I expected to be doing that.But I'm not.Everyone in this movie really loved this movie and it came through. And they obviously loved the original too. They didn't try to reinvent the wheel, but instead redesigned it to fit a new vehicle. The game was still the game but in a new way that was still dated (feeling old and new at the same time) just like a game that is mysterious and possibly ancient should be. The characters chemistry worked well together, these guys are obviously friends on set and probably off too. And the dynamics of the story felt appropriate for kids my this generation, just like the dynamics felt right in the first movie for my generation.In the end I found myself laughing and saying aww and yes, even falling for the smoulderingly a time or two. If you go into this looking for a faithful remake of the first film you're going to be sorely disappointed. But if you're looking for a sequel done by people who obviously loved the original and wanted to continue the fascinating and amazing world of Jumanji, it's well worth it.","

"rebeccalucy","20 December 2017","A surprisingly good continuation of this series, with some good humour and a modern update with a twist. The acting is decent, with the rock and Kevin Hart giving better performances than usual. But Karen Gillan and Jack Black supplied most of the great comedy in the film. Jack had to portray a very stereotypical popular girl, but he gives it all he has got and adds some much needed heart. However, the villian is very under used and bland. Bobby Canavale did not have any time to develop his character, so he does seem as such a big threat.I really enjoyed the video game update, with the multiple lives they allow for urgency and a little comedy. They definitely use the video game idea to their advantage, but it could become a little dated in the future. Also, some of the comedy falls flat and could become dated also. Such as the constant references to technology. The cinematography and editing is basic but that obviously wasn't the focus. Some of the backgrounds are beautiful with the lush jungle. However the CGI could use a little more work considering the amount it is used. Overall, a fun update to Jumanji work at least one watch!","

The script is not interesting at all, useless punches to make comedy, unnecessary CGI and Visual Effects. The villain of the movie and the different levels of the game (if considered so) should have been worked upon. Gaming Industry brings you a wide scope of adding elements of entertainment and this movie seems to be a nothing more than a coin gamebox.
The Rock fans are going to applaud his appearance but we have already seen him doing helicopter stunts previously. This movie is not worthy option to be viewed in cinemas.","

Instead of trying to redo something that didn't need redoing, they took the movie in a different direction, letting the viewer enter the jungle of Jumanji.The cast in this film was amazing! The jokes were perfect and suited the characters perfectly. No one else could have pulled this off but Jack Black, The Rock and Kevin Hart.The downfalls of the movie was that the CGI was terrible, the film dragged on a little with constant action scenes and there's absolutely no depth to the show. But over all the faults were made up by the humor. If you looking for something light, family expectable and full of fun laughs, defiantly give this one a try.","

"vesil_vesalier","31 March 2018","I love being surprised by movies, don't you?I've said before that expectations destroy movies, and I still hold that it's true. But what's interesting is having LOW expectations of movies. Then, when you go in expecting to hate every freaking scene in the film, you're pleased when there are things about it you liked.In the case of what I guess is classified as a ""Reboot"" (although having an Easter Egg planted right smack in the middle of the movie that tells you otherwise means it's a sequel), JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE was an absolute riot.I liked the original JUMANJI, but I never fell in love with it. Robin Williams was excellent because honestly, even in amazingly bad films such as TOYS, it wasn't Robin I was irritated with. Guys like him always push it as hard as they can, but they can't do more than what they're stuck to work with.Comparing the two, I would say that what truly was lacking in the original was a definitive sense of humor. Trying to balance humor and drama is tough, VERY tough, because the themes don't generally mix together. One usually dominates over the other, making one the flavor while the other is the main course. In the first JUMANJI, it wasn't demanding enough to be scary, and it wasn't funny enough to be hilarious.While I won't say that WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is scary in any way, it does at least TRY to have a more pressing urgency to it. The original wasn't terribly clear on the more interesting rules of the game: if one of the players died, for REAL, what would have happened? It's presumed, based on the theme of the film, that it's not possible for the players to die. Here, coming up with a definite penalty system, clearly illustrated early on in the predicament of the four students stuck in Jumanji, the pressure is on. It's delivered with humor, but it's there, and it keeps you guessing throughout the film as to what exactly Game Over would be, when somebody fails.One of the most shining moments of the film has to be the main cast, acting as if they were the teenagers that inhabit their bodies. On the comedy side, nobody can beat Jack Black, who is the avatar of the popular cellphone-obsessed white teenage girl, reacting and over-reacting to the fact that she's now an overweight, middle-aged pudgy white dude. Dwayne Johnson also shines here, stretching his acting muscles to emulate the leader of the gang, as they try to team up and make their way through Jumanji. Karen Gillan, whom I've never had the pleasure of seeing in anything before now, was also hilarious in her own way, her avatar being the opposite of the teenager that's stuck inside of her. And Kevin Hart, the man who makes comedy as a profession, is good, but strangely outplayed here, delivering yuks but never really stealing the show. On the dramatic side, the film never does take itself too seriously, but I believe it to be one of its strengths. The main drama comes from the ticking of the clock, from the pressure of racing toward the ending without assurances that everything's going to be okay. If you want a criticism, I will give you two of them: I'm not sure if the kids who start out the movie are acting poorly, or acting poorly on purpose. I think it's the latter, where the director knew he'd have less screen time with them than with their avatars, so he needed a way to kind of... over-identify their personalities early on, so you could see Dwayne and co. pull off such great jobs at emulating them. I THINK that's the reason. Because honestly, the first part of this movie was, for me, the toughest to get through.Secondly, the villain's scenes seemed unnecessary, most of the time. The team could have been fighting Jumanji as a semi-formed background filled with enemies, and it would have been just as effective. The heavy, whose character is a nod to the original JUMANJI, feels out of place here, without a real definitive character or personality of any kind.Overall, however, I had a blast with this film, and I laughed myself to tears through a lot of it. I don't remember having NEARLY as much fun with the original. The marketeers want to call this a ""reboot"", and I see, according to IMDb, that the studios are already gearing up for what's listed as ""JUMANJI 2"", but I don't care what the marketeers are saying, cause it's just not true. This was a SEQUEL to the original, and it lives in that rarest of categories where it was much better than the original.And that's where I will leave it. The review, I mean. Because I'd love to get my hands on this movie, and add it to my collection.","

"JackCowart34","13 July 2022","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is technically a sequel, but is perfectly capable of standing alone as one of the most effectively paced, smartly written, and conceptually engrossing adventure films released in recent years. The actors that play the four main characters have fantastic chemistry and impressive comedic timing. Each of them were given a difficult task of playing against type, excluding Kevin Hart who virtually plays the same character you've seen him as in countless other movies. As far as supporting actors go, Bobby Cannavale clearly had a good time playing the villain. The jungle setting provides beautiful scenery, and Kasdan uses CGI relatively sparingly, but rather effectively. The dialogue was hysterically witty, and the fight scenes were well choreographed. The only time the film seemed to drag was in the first twenty minutes before they had entered the game. Regardless, that's a somewhat minute problem for a film that more than makes up for the slow setup in the ensuing ninety minutes.","

"nikhilbhalwankar","31 December 2017","I watched Jumanji yesterday in 3D and I must say that movie is fully exciting till the end. Everyone has acted very well and Junanji never lets you down at any moment throughout the movie runtime. Not only the story is very well written but also the director has executed it perfectly. Dr. Smolder Bravestone and Ruby Roundhouse has done ass kicking action sequences.Whereas Shelly Oberon and Franklin Mouse Finbar has done nice comic scenes.Overall its a great adventure to watch Jumanji. Don not miss the fun and book your tickets right away.","

They had a nice notion of making a comedic espect of it using ""body swap"" (the big muscular in the game is actually a weak nerd in real life, the popular girl is a middle aged man etc. - that's pretty much it.Like this game, some things should be left alone .","

"thekarmicnomad","18 March 2018","Maybe it is the hipster in me but I feel almost apologetic about how much I love this movie.This is very similar to Jumanji but the characters are sucked into the world rather than the jungle bursting out - cue the charging Rhinos.The reason I went to see this is I fancied something, light, witty, action packed and guilt free.This hit everyone of those point spot on!
There was great action scenes, some humorous bits of dialogue and enough of a plot to keep things moving.This is obviously not very deep (which was exactly what I was after) fairly predictable and does play to stereotypes - but none of that matters.If you are after some easy family fun then is perfect!
I can't post this review without special mention Karen Gillian, who is not only kick-ass but literally stunning in this role.","

I don't think it's the best option but it's jokes usually land and the action scenes are fun. I think the general storyline is kind of weak and some of the jokes aren't that good, also it's pretty predictable and the main characters are a little annoying. But overall it's alright","

"Anurag-Shetty","5 January 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle tells the story of young Spencer(Alex Wolff), Fridge(Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany(Madison Iseman) & Martha(Morgan Turner). These four high school students, get pulled into a video game called Jumanji. They also get turned into their respective game avatars. Now, Spencer(Dwayne Johnson), Fridge(Kevin Hart), Bethany(Jack Black) & Martha(Karen Gillan) have to finish the game, to return to the real world. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a thoroughly entertaining film. Director Jake Kasdan has successfully introduced Jumanji to a new generation, while also honoring the 1995 Robin Williams classic. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is immersive(especially in IMAX). The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. My favorites are the helicopter scene & the climax. The effortless camaraderie among the four main cast members is another strong-point of the film. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Spencer. Kevin Hart is hysterical as Fridge. Jack Black is hilarious as Bethany. Karen Gillan is outstanding as Martha. Together, Johnson, Hart, Black & Gillan make the audience guffaw uncontrollably, with their histrionics. Rhys Darby is impressive as Nigel. Bobby Cannavale is great as Van Pelt. Nick Jonas is amazing as Alex. Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman & Morgan Turner are awesome as Young Spencer, Young Fridge, Young Bethany & Young Martha, respectively. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a must watch, for fans of Jumanji(1995) & newcomers alike. Go & have a great time with your entire family!","

"n-kefala","7 January 2018","""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is a light-hearted, easy-to-watch action/comedy, that strikes the balance between referencing its nostalgic origins without being obnoxious. Also with a different take on the coming-of-age story, and a good dynamic between the five main actors. Mostly great fun, with Jack Black outrageously entertaining and Dwayne Johnson who is sweetly funny as the muscular incarnation of a nerd.
Like a video game, the narrative lacks any character development, relying on chases and the fear of death. But all-in-all, the rebooted version of ""Jumanji"" remains a fun-family film to watch over the year and I think without a doubt, will bring more productions as soon as possible.

"namashi_1","21 December 2017","A standalone sequel to the 1995 classic 'Jumanji', 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' never comes close to its evergreen hit, but is entertaining nonetheless. With an exciting theme, brisk pacing & a scene-stealing Jack Black performance, this Christmas Biggie is the one you should watch with your family this weekend. 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji, and, playing as the characters they chose, must beat the game in order to return to the real world.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' rises on the strength of its perfectly done casting. Dwayne Johnson is charming & likable, playing an against type role of a guy who's scared of almost everything around him. Its good to see the Hollywood A-Lister take on a role that is completely opposite to his general buff image. Kevin Hart, too, is game & raises some laughs as the guy with the backpack. Karen Gillan is sexy & shows skill for some kick-ass action, especially her when she dances while beating up the bad-guys. But its Jack Black, who steals the show. His character, a girl in reality, is a riot. His feminine body-language as well as his dialogue delivery, to his hilarious reaction of having a penis, is laugh-out-loud funny. Black is in great comedic form, proving once again that he can land a joke better than most comedians working in Hollywood today. Its a performance that's bound to get the most laughs & claps. Nick Jonas charms in his part too. And the kids back in reality, bring earnestness to their parts. The rest of 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is pure fun. The pacing is brisk, the action is sharp, the comic moments of its 4 principal characters are mostly on point & the visuals are sure to please the kids. Its a big-budgeted blockbuster, that does the genre right, by never being anything else but a popcorn entertainer. If I had to count on the flaws, however, it would be the villain here, played by a one-note Bobby Cannavale, who comes across as a baddie only there to exist for the sake of a villain. But that's me asking too much from a family-movie, that actually entertains, despite its flaws.With Co-Writer & Director Jake Kasdan catching the pulse of this blockbuster & excellent Cinematography by Gyula Pados, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' offers a good time at the movies. Go, enjoy!","

I should've trusted my instincts about the trailer and clips to not to set foot in the cinema watching this crap.
Unfunny recycled jokes, lame story and kindergarden level villain.
Jumanji suppose to be exciting, emotional, funny and a little scary, but this movie failed to achieve none of it.
The screenwriters probably wrote the script in the bathroom on toilet paper and forgot to wipe with it their ass.
 
Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are from now on my official kryptonite. Arnold S. had more charisma than both of them together.
Even Jack Black who I dig, gave a goosebumps level performance.Robin Williams is probably turning in his grave.","

The superb cast of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart coupled with Karen Gillan's beauty makes this movie most interesting. Once you are into it, you can't help but notice the stunning visuals; thanks to the Kualoa Ranch private nature reserve, where the movie was filmed. The storyline is excellent, with every detail taken care of - right from how swash plates of a helicopter blade control the pitch of the blades, creating thrust, to how game environments often defy real world physics. The slapstick humour adds to the comical charm of this wonderful movie - a mind freshener for the whole family.","

Don't doubt me when I say this movie is worth the 2 hours and the money spent. It is nothing like the original, so don't expect that. But I will say I like it better than the original, which is hard to do these days. Jack Black nailed his character of a teenage, social-media-driven girl and had me laughing with almost every word he spoke. The rest of the cast added their humour as well which just made it an amazingly funny movie overall. It's not one that is so focused on the plot as much as it is just being plain funny, which is alright with me and great for anyone looking for a good laugh.","

"tinovalkki","25 December 2017","22 years ago released original Jumanji with Robin Williams wasn't as big success as makers expected. Even it wasn't so big box office magnet it has still become a movie classic. Maybe that is a reason who we were have to wait the sequel so long. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is not exactly a sequel even it start where last movie ended. More it is a original story, not re-filming. Because the original movie is such a classic this could be a catastrophic. It is good to see, that it isn't. Even this is not something big movie history, it is still quite enjoyable adventure movie. Script is quite stupid, but has enough of strengths to hold the story together. It is very solid two hour movie experience and timing is strict enough to to keep you oriented. Great effects combined with good storytelling is satisfying enough. Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black are fun to watch. Well timing action with great effects makes this movie quite enjoyable to watch. It may not be any movie classic, but surely it is fun to watch.","

I don't understand why ruining an old classic tha made dream when I was a child, rebooting the franchise more than 20 years later.I cannot judge the story, as I did not finish to watch, but the movie does not hook me up. This is just another case of Hollywood trying hard to squeeze an amazing 90s franchise, just to earn as much money as possible. I will try to finish the movie, but this will be painful.","

"editionsnl","31 December 2017","Using the washroom after viewing this movie had me more on the edge of my seat than the film itself. Average cinematography, the characters were stereotypical and boring, the plot was highly predictable and trite (as in, there was no part of the entire movie that caught me off guard or that I didn't expect), and the scenes that were apparently meant to be suspenseful or exciting were not. The film was full of cheesy, forced dialogue and pointless romantic subplots (one of my biggest pet peeves in action/adventure movies). It did have a few funny moments, which is just about the only thing that made me give it higher than a 1/10 rating.It's not the worst thing I've seen in my life, and to be fair I don't usually watch this genre of movie (it was the one my cousin wanted to see), but around halfway through I definitely was bored and looking forward to the end. In hindsight, I wouldn't have spent $10 and two hours on this. It's probably an all right family movie or an appealing plot for a 12-year-old, but for me it was a total yawn.","

I think that Dwayne Johnson (Spencer), Kevin Hart (Fridge), Jack Black (Bethany), Karen Gillan (Martha) and Nick Jonas (Alex) are so fantastic in their characters. This movie is the most mysterious, the most humorous, the most original because is a good cover and the funniest movie. And it is really little scary. Jake Kasdan was the best director for this movie. The special effects ars just really splendid and I liked are. It's the best movie I've ever seen.

"CatfishOpinions","20 July 2022","I usually have very very low expectations for these random action comedy movies that come out all the time. They're usually incredibly cringey, dull, unfunny or forgettable. But I was delighted to discover that this movie is not one of those.Really the only way to go about creating a sequel to Jumanji starring Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black is not to take yourself seriously. This movie only works because the entire time it is marveling at how stupid and over-the-top it is. They make fun of themselves, they mock the plot itself at points, and nothing in the story is taken too seriously. So you're both laughing AT the movie and WITH the movie. It knows that its own existence is pretty dumb. And that's how it's able to be fun instead of cringey!Also, the action is pretty good. Everything is exciting and fun and, like I said, very self-aware. The comedy is also actually pretty good for what you'd usually expect in these kinds of movies. Lots of the jokes were genuinely funny and the way all the actors made fun of themselves and hammed it up was pretty entertaining.So yes! Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a success in my book. I have lots of respect for it.","

"namikazedante","30 December 2017","I really wanted to like this movie because after seeing the cast on 'The Graham Norton Show' they seemed to click so good together and they were so funny. So funny I was laughing really heard. But about the movie. It starts off exactly where the first one left off which is pretty amazing and awesome but after that great scene then the movie just spirals down to another 5/10 hollywood crap-fest. Filled with cliche moments, forced laughter and such cringe worthy moments I just had to look up into the ceiling because it was really terrible at times. True the movie has it moments and it is funny at times but the main plot is nothing like the original which I saw last week and it still holds up and that is a 8/10 movie even though it has some lame jokes here and there. But it's a truly amazing movie. But when it comes to this one. Sure it is entertaining and The cast is great but the movie is so poorly written and I was sitting there expecting a twist or something cool to happen but it's really lame if you compare it to the first movie which was and still is an amazing movie. The intro and build up of Alan Parrish story which seems like a Stephen King inspired moment, how it is filmed and the style and yeah everything. But nope I really wanted to like this movie but I can't give more than 5/10 because of all the terrible, cliche, cringe and hollywood nonsense it brings with it. And yes it is even a very weak 5/10.

"bobandlulureview","27 March 2018","Just as much as I love reading books, I enjoy watching movies too. It's a gene inherited from my parents. 
Now, besides watching movies in the theatres, I record movies on my set-top box and watch it at night, within the comfortable confines of our living room. 
I have new found company for animated films in my five year old. (Though, I really think he comes just for the popcorn). I record movies for Arjun as well and he has now slowly graduated to watching non-animated children's films like Home Alone, Baby's Day Out, Dunston Checks In, Zathura etc. I recently made him watch Jumanji (Part 1) on TV and he seemed to like it. 
And what do you know! Part 2 had hit the theatres. I wasn't even aware of a sequel until I heard it on the radio. I screeched in delight and looked around in the car at the other passengers. My parents had suddenly something very important to discuss and my husband began avoiding eye contact. Arjun looked at me and said ""we'll go driving"". Please note that I have recently started driving and shall do another post reviewing the Alto K10 automatic car. 
I LOVED (still do) Jumanji. I couldn't wait to watch the sequel and dish it. Sequels rarely match up to the original. We went to a nondescript mall closest to our house that had the most convenient timing, post lunch. Not expecting a jam packed theatre, I decided to book tickets at the counter. Bad decision, as the only seats available was at the first row. 
I was a bit disappointed thinking Arjun would have to strain his neck, looking up at the screen, the whole time. We grabbed our 3D glasses. Arjun wasn't pleased with his small ""baby glasses"". Since we'd just had lunch, I had to pull the drooling 5 year old away from the popcorn counter with the promise of cheese popcorn during the ""intermission"". The couple walking towards our seat was wondering why I was giving them dirty looks. They plonked themselves next to us with their gigantic tub of popcorn! (Exaggerated eye-roll) 
Arjun is very loud in theatres. He waits for the theatre to quieten before he can make his proclamation to the public. ""I am very very hungry, you haven't given me anything to eat"" said Arjun looking at our neighbours' popcorn. Thankfully, the screen lit up and the trailers of the upcoming films began. It started off with the Akshay Kumar starrer 'Padman'. The audience drowned in laughter, the trailer was funny. Arjun waited for his moment and loudly asked, ""This is not a Batman, this is a Padman, but what is a Pad?"" Everyone burst out laughing again. Arjun was pleased and with that he forgot his popcorn. 
REVIEW BEGINS HERE: The movie begins with a kid inserting a cartridge into a video game console and my heart sank a little. I have no patience for spotty high school kids and how dare they change the game from a board game to a video game. Are all these millennials too cool for board games!
The movie proceeds with four high school kids being sucked into the game's setting into the world of Jumanji where they don on their respective video game avatars. This is where Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes his entry which was met with a lot of hoots and cat calls in the theatre and a ""Why are you screaming now"" from Arjun. The four characters are then enlisted to return the jewel, 'Jaguar's eye' to a gigantic rocky Jaguar statue. The movie follows their journey from their entry into the game all the way up till the statue. The path is trodden with hurdles thrown in by Russel Van Pelt, a hunter, who wants the jewel for himself in order to be able to control the animals of Jumanji. Each player has three lives, losing all of which would mean death. This is a typical action-adventure film and it reminded me of a light hearted version of Hunger Games. 
The 3D effects are superb and the effect was much more pronounced being in the first row. The movie is HILARIOUS, the actors are funny especially Jack Black and Kevin Hart. The five year old had his eyebrows up and mouth wide open so I am presuming he enjoyed it too. At the risk of sounding unfaithful to Robin Williams, Dwayne did an excellent job as the protagonist, Dr. Smolder Bravestone. 
Yes, I would record this movie when it comes on TV and watch it again.","

I had some trepidation about going to see this but an Amazon Prime early screening ticket made me watch it.I don't regret it, as it was enjoyable fun, made me laugh a few times and had decent CGI which did not take me out of the movie. The leads had great comedic talent and I liked the way that they made me feel like they actually were in other people's bodies. It was a bonus to see one of my favorite actors appear mid movie. The only quibble I have is that the bad guy was a let down. I kept waiting for him to show his powers and be a great threat and expecting a big ""boss"" fight but sadly it did not happen. Also the Transport Hanger was built up as hard level to beat and it was not. They easily outnumbered the guards who were defeated by a single character. I'm glad they decided at the end that this would not have a sequel. When you see the scene you will know what I mean. All in all, a great piece of entertainment with great action, adventure and comedy.","

"bowmanblue","1 January 2018","...but it probably helps! Direct sequels to films that are released a loooong time after the original don't have a tendency to do that well at the Box Office ('Basic Instinct 2' - anyone remember that?). Most times it appears that the original fan-base isn't in the cinema-going demographic and the film doesn't click with today's audience. However, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' not only does well to differentiate itself from the original, but also succeeds without the inclusion of the man who (arguably) helped make the first instalment so special - the ever excellent Robin Williams.'Jumanji' was about a magic board game that sucked players in and made them play the game 'for real' in order to survive. Well, in this day and age, the producers of the film obviously realise that no self-respecting kid would ever play a board game any more (sadly, in my opinion - I love a bit of Monopoly!) so they've brought it right up to date and turned the board game into a computer game. So, when four high school students find themselves in detention cleaning out the school's dusty basement, they stumble across the 'antique' console and decide to kill some time playing a quick game (this never happened to the 'Breakfast Club' did it?!).Now, this is where the film gets a bit different. The first ten to fifteen minutes are spent introducing us - the audience - to our young heroes. However, as soon as they enter the computer game, all of them acquire 'avatars' i.e. in-game characters who are all older, hunkier and possessing skills required for completing the game. Therefore, pretty much the entire film is spent with the kids' 'adult' incarnations, but seeing as one such incarnation is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, that's not so bad. So, our young heroes quickly become 'old' heroes and have to save a fictional jungle-land from a tyrannical regime. I guess that's a pretty standard plot for either a modern action film or a computer game. I suppose that's what this film is - a standard action film and it's enjoyable enough if that's all you're looking for or expecting. However, if you're a fan of computer games and the clichés that come with the medium, you'll get a lot more out of it than just a few action set pieces. It does brilliantly at poking fun of all the silly things you can expect from video games - everything from entering the game with three 'lives' to owning a backpack which can seemingly fit numerous ridiculously-large items in and never slow its owner down.But, however many 'in-jokes' are included for us gamers and no matter how impressive the action scenes are, the film would be nothing without the stars and I have to hand it to the four (adult) actors who take the reigns for the majority of the film. It's because of them that this film succeeds, for they don't just have to play 'their' characters - they have to play their teenage incarnations playing adult characters who are, in turn, playing clichéd computer game characters. And, as much as I love Dwayne Johnson in everything he does, I have to say that the star of the show is Jack Black. This is because he's - technically - playing a spoilt teenage girl. No, seriously. And he does it perfectly, stealing every scene as he goes. Also, you may not expect much 'character development' in a film about kids being drawn into a computer game, but I thought there was actually a decent enough 'journey' for the youngsters (albeit in their adult bodies!) to go on and they ended their story as different people to how they began it.So, if you're only looking for a run-of-the-mill action film to put your brain on hold to, then you'll certainly find it here. However, if, like me, you're a gamer and want to see a film that lovingly pokes fun at everything we hold dear, you'll definitely find that here to. Special mention to something that happens at the end. I expected something to happen between a pair of characters and it didn't. Something more 'realistic' happened instead and I found myself awarding 'kudos points' to the film's writers for not taking the predictable route at the end.","

"jackstonestone","9 March 2022","So jumanji welcome to the jungle is a movie about characters that get in trouble at school and then they find a video game that has existed for a very long period of time from the electrical engineering portion of the school this game was put away on the bottom of a table and then by some accident they figured out that this video game is actually like possessed and that they all magically get pulled into the game and they figure out that they are avatars of the game and then they also figure out their very own special abilities and superpowers and then they go on a super big and cool adventure but there is a main antagonist of the the game that is after them and trying to kill them and stop them from putting a magical jewel inside of a giant animal shaped mountain to get them out of the game and they do end up doing that and in the end they all become friends because during the adventure that they all had they started to get to know each other a whole lot more well and have started to get along with one each other as well. HOWEVER, this movie is very underrated in my opinion and that it deserves better reviews but only in my personal opinion because I would not want to offend anyone else out there or be rude or mean because I'm just making a review so here we go. So first of all the casting call for this movie is amazing with a lot of actors that I both love and recognize and seeing both Jack black and the rock and Kevin Hart all in the same movie is just such a wonderful thing to see and i think that a lot of other people who watched this movie loved that to. Also i really do love how each of the characters has their very own special skills and superpowers that can be utilized and are mandatory for completing the adventure and that they're not just skills and abilities that they just have for fun but they're actually useful in this sense. Also the humor and comedy of this movie with both Jack black and Kevin Hart is just as good as they've ever been. Also all of the action in this movie like riding around in a helicopter while getting shot at by guns and misses and being chased and hunted down by various animals that are being controlled by a jungle super villain and having cool fight scenes along the way really does make this more of an adventure to watch but in general it's just really entertaining to watch. Also the cgi and special effects like the animals and the respawning of all the characters falling from the sky and having like really cool superhero landings on the way down and the rock doing really cool super strength fighting moves sending enemies flying into the air. Also i love the character development in this Kacie for how all of the characters become friends at the end of the adventure that they have vecause before they barley liked each other or even knew each other that well but now they are all friends now and that's a very nice way to end of this movie. In conclusion, this movie has a lot of very wonderful story elements to offer and it does it well in execution, so what would I rate this movie on a scale of 1 to 10, a solid 9 because of logic sometimes but that's about it everything else was great in my personal opinion.","

"rolandjordaan2","14 September 2018","Like most people from my generation I was mad as hell when I heard that they were remaking the 1995 cult classic 'Jumanj', then cooled down a bit when I heard it was actually a sequel and not a remake, then got mad again when I saw the cast and then got furious when I learned that Jumanji has turned into a video game...now having actually seen it...it pains me to admit...I really loved the hell out of this movie, honestly, this was one of the most enjoyable movies I've sat through this year. It is a sequel, sure, but while paying clever homages to the original, it is completely doing its own thing with truly likable and relatable characters, some real tear-jerker moments and a few scenes that actually do get slightly intense (nothing like the intensity the original created, but while that movie was quite dark, this is a comedy, plain and simple). I truly thought I'd be the last person recommending this film, but, put your feelings for the original aside, see this as a standalone film and just go in and enjoy it, you truly will not be disappointed.","

"drunken_munki","19 October 2021","They took the interesting idea from the 1995 movie, and made it better.The characters are first and foremost the main reason why this is enjoyable and why the film works as a jungle adventure. The four teens are taken out of their world and dropped into the Jungle as recreated in the form of a video game simulation. The Jumanji game box updated itself, presumably with the same magic that allows it to create a world of its own.The actors did a lot here to play as the 'game' characters as if played by the younger cast. The nesting of characters inside characters was very clever and allows some real exploration of the young characters and the predicaments of being stuck in the game.The visuals are excellent, the action is paced out well and the plot is unravelled as a simple action adventure, but with the character work between everything it is very entertaining. Also very funny, a lot of the material is delivered excellently and this had a lot of very funny moments.I can't speak to the older film, it was one I watched as a kid. Anyway, this is a clever rework of the material and I think they did an excellent job. Something that a lot of modern movies lack is 'soul', but I have to say this film has it in spades. The ending was moving.8/10 excellent escapism in the style of classic adventure such as 'Indiana Jones' but set with some interesting concepts and twists with modern technology.","

"statuskuo","23 December 2017","How refreshing...a teen adventure comedy that has little to do with self-hatred and darkness. This is a throwback movie down to the epic music. This is just a plain fun movie. Despite the fact that there are missing elements from the original, this movie boosts the dusty board game concept into the video game concept (it's like the movies ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" both are good, but you just need an extra jump start).
It was then no surprise to see Jake Kasdan direct this, as there is smart set-up (their abilities and weaknesses) and payoff (not going to give it away). I am going to bet right now, he is going to direct some ""Star Wars"" movie in the future (as his dad Lawrence Kasdan, wrote arguably the best one so far).
Yes, there are lingering questions after the fact, but it makes sense now why Dwayne Johnson is the star he is. He is not above being a nerd, doing nerdy things.
Go see this movie and just have fun.","

"chriskylie","14 August 2020","A silly, warm-hearted, well executed adventure film for all the family. Jumanji is fully aware of what sort of film it is and what it's audience wants and it sticks to that formula unashamedly. But that's why Jumanji is a surprising success. It's got enough old school ""Indiana Jones"" style capers to appeal to the nostalgics, whilst incorporating plenty of modern gaming references and in-jokes to entertain a new crowd. There isn't a weak link in the cast (Black and Gillan both comedic standouts) and although highly predictable Jumanji even has a credible moral core. I'd happily play it again.","

Visual effects were great, so that the whole film made me think the movie is real and it's really happening in the real world. Some scenes were funny and gave me excitement. There were only two scenes that I didn't like. One was Bethany's urination scene as a boy and the first kissing scene of Spencer and Martha. Those scenes are really gross. I wish I didn't see those scenes. Except for these two scenes, everything looks good and it's a great film that gives you fun. I don't know about the others. As for me, I really enjoyed.","

"GiraffeDoor","30 November 2019","Doubtlessly there are going to be killjoys who feel the first movie somehow morphs if any kind of derivative material is made from is and that this sequel has ""ruined"" a classic.Admittedly I had a few qualms about some universe mechanics but that's not really why I watch those movies.Not the poignant, emotional powerhouse of the first one, just a bit of fun with just enough character development surrounding the theme of being your best self. It's actually pretty darling how the jock, two nerds (I call them that with love) and a conventionally attractive social media addict realise by the end they have more in common with each other than they first realised.The whole thing looks stunning and the set pieces are everything you want. They combine, spectacle, humour and great suspense.I was a little thrown by the thing of different actors playing the main characters playing the characters while they are in the game but it didn't taint the picture. Jack Black made a very convincing teenage girl though they sadly milked this gag for a lot more than it was worth, especially when she tries to teach Ruby how to flirt.I have more mixed feelings about the way the whole thing is presented exactly like a video game and takes a lot of time to mock game play mechanics. I actually like that it's a videogame now. It's pretty frightening to think the game can evolve to make sure that people won't lose interest in it. I did get the impression that no one in the game is sentient but the main characters and this was a negative but I choose to try and interpret it the other way.Ultimately a good bit of fun viewing that ticks all the boxes for its genre.","

"RhapsodyReviews","27 December 2019","Review:
'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is an adventure-comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan. It is the third installment of the 'Jumanji' franchise, after 'Zathura: A Space Adventure' (2005) and a direct sequel to 'Jumanji' (1995), which was based on the children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg.
This is a fun, hilarious adventure family film, what more can you ask for? The chemistry between all the actors are on point, bringing a fun adventure film to life.
Set twenty-one years after Jumanji, it follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji and play as their chosen characters. Joining another player, they must beat the game to return home.
Every character in the video games world was played to perfection. Dwayne Johnson basically retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead, provides a smoldering and intense performance, riddled with good-natured hilarity as the lead in this film. Kevin Hart was great as the sidekick, I think he was involved in every funny moment in which I laughed the hardest. Karen Gillan was perfect as the badass who was played by a shy teenage girl. Finally, the master of the whole film, Jack Black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection.
The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish throughout the movie, which I liked, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.
Overall, it's a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor.
4/5","

The original is a masterpiece of good news v bad news in an action story. Robin Williams gave an iconic performance. The jungle sequences were insane. This film has almost no good jungle sequences and it's just the characters who do a lot of bad jokes. Everyone involved who made this project disgusts me.","

"suspiria77","9 April 2018","I am happy to say the new Jumanji is an absolute delight from start to finish. All of the actors are excellent but Jack Black truly shines as a high school girl trapped in, well, Jack Black's body. The action and special effects are thrilling, but the movie really shines in the comedy and the chemistry between the cast.A really smart choice on the filmmaker's part was to take the time at the beginning of the movie to establish the characters of the four main teenagers, so much so that when they enter the video game you still feel like you are watching those four characters even as they have been replaced by their more famous counterparts, which is a testament to the acting of those four stars.This taking time at the beginning makes the first act a little bit light on the action, but it makes up for that once our hapless heroes arrive in the world of Jumanji. The helicopter sequence in particular is a standout, one that left my five year old quite literally on the edge of her seat.The film is also funny, very, very funny. Jack Black has had a rough stretch of bombs and has been almost forgotten in recent years, but he absolutely takes over this movie in sections, reminding us of his considerable comedic talent. This is not to take away anything from the rest of the cast, who all have great moments, the banter between Johnson and Hart is fantastic, and Gillan's dance fighting is a particularly enjoyable moment as well.While it can be said that the happy ending and the main characters never seem truly in danger throughout the film, I don't think anyone is going to see this film for realism or for an unhappy resolution so it's hard to fault it for that. If you are looking for a fast paced fun bit of entertainment for the whole family (my five year old daughter and 65 year old father in law loved it equally) you can't do much better than Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.Rating *** (out of Four)","

"leonblackwood","3 May 2018","The Review:
I was in two minds about this remake, mainly because I really enjoyed the original but I must admit, I liked what they done with the storyline. Some of the slapstick comedy wasn't that great, and I personally think that they could have done much more with the concept but I still enjoyed the movie, and the chemistry between the various characters was amusing. The CGI was also quite impressive, and I liked the twist when they went into the game but once the shock element went out the window, it seemed to go downhill. Anyway, the movie is based on 4 characters, Spencer (Dwayne Johnson, Martha (Karen Gillan), Fridge (Kevin Hart) and Bethany (Jack Black), who have all been given detention at school. Whilst on detention in the basement of the school, they come across an old video game, which turns out to be Jumanji, so they connect it to a TV and they decide to play it. After picking there various characters, the 4 teenagers get transported into the game, and they change into the characters that they have picked. Once they work out what has happened, Nigel (Rhys Darby), explains to them that they have to retrieve the Jaguar's Eye from a corrupt archaeologist, Russell Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), which they have to return to a Jaguar statue to leave the game. Whilst on there mission, they come across another teenager, Alex (Nick Jonas), who has been stuck in the game for 20 years, so they join forces to get the priceless relic, so they can return it to it's rightful place. The various characters all bring something different to the movie, and I liked the fact that Jack Black was actually a girl. The Rock just had to be the brave one, which wasn't surprising but Kevin Hart was quite funny as the Fridge. Although I found the movie entertaining, the humour was a bit too safe for me and a lot of the scenes were pretty far fetched. With that aside, I would watch the movie again, and I can appreciate that the director tried something different with a great concept but I still think that it could have been much better. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Jake Kasdan, who also brought you Sex Tape starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel, Bad Teacher, which also starred Cameron Diaz, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, The TV Set, Orange County and Zero Effect. Judging by his previous movies, he's obviously come from a comedy background, so this project was slightly out of his comfort zone. He's also worked on various TV series, like Freaks & Geeks, Grosse Pointe, Undeclared, Cracking Up, New Girl and the Grinder, and he is due to make another Bad Teacher movie, which is in development. For a remake, this movie certainly blew up at the box office, and it's made the Rock one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood today but for it's time, the original is still better in my eyes, even though it only made $263million at the box office, with a $65million budget. Budget: $90million
Worldwide Gross: $957millionGenre: Action, Adventure, Comedy

"jimbo-53-186511","29 December 2019","When 4 teenagers are summoned to do detention, 1 of the teenagers comes across an old computer console whilst rooting around in the room. Out of curiosity, the teenagers fire it up and each pick a character to play as on the game. Unbeknownst to them, once they select their characters they end up sucked into the game and become the very avatars they've chosen. The stakes are high for the teenagers when they find that they can only be freed from the game by returning a jewel back to the Jaguar to release a curse that has been put on Jumanji.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has a very 'Breakfast Club' type opening to proceedings with the characters ending up in detention and playing similar clichéd characters to what we saw in that film over 30 years ago. However, the screenwriters have carefully crafted the characters in this manner as a mere set-up for them arriving in the game as the adult avatars that they've chosen.In effect, what this does is allows the teenagers to retain their original personalities, but in the bodies of completely different people. It perhaps doesn't sound that amusing if you look at it written down, but when you see the results on screen then you'll understand what I'm getting at. In fact, the character chemistry is really where the film is at its best; Spencer and Fridge have their roles slightly reversed in the game which sets up some fun interplay between Johnson and Hart (particularly when Fridge forgets that he is no longer bigger and tougher than Spencer). Black perhaps has the most fun camping it up as a teenage girl trapped inside a middle-aged man's body - I have to admit part of me found it a little creepy, but a lot of me found it very funny (particularly when Bethany is trying to get used to her new 'body'). Gillan doesn't quite have as much fun as the others as she is mostly forced to play it straight - although her flirting scene is good and she looks terrific in those little shorts!!!). Jonas is perhaps the slight weak link here as he never seems to quite gel with the rest of the cast. I don't rate him as much of an actor, but he was OK in this one.I've talked a lot about the characters and they are a big selling point in this film; the original film had Robin Williams and it's fair to say that he completed dominated that picture. In this film, the 4 teenagers play as computer game characters and all bring different skill-sets to the table; this automatically makes the narrative more involving as you know that each character needs the other which sets up a strong dynamic. In the original film I always felt that Williams carried the film whereas in this remake the 4 actors all bring it to life making it feel like a nice collective effort.If I was to be critical of the film then I did feel that the story was only so-so and I thought the villain was poor as were his band of goons.In summary then this was a fun adventure which mostly works due to the strong chemistry and camaraderie between the 4 leads. Having them play as computer game characters rather than just been sucked into the game as themselves adds another dimension to the film and makes them interesting. If you're in one of those 'switch off brain and enjoy moods' then just sit back and relax as there's a lot of joy to be found in this film.","

"bodhi-13262","30 December 2017","The infamous board-game as we know it has evolved, and this time it has taken the form a new system with new players. Having hit the reset button, does the 'Jumanji' from the 90s adapt as well as it does in the present day?1. Picking up where we left off from the original 1995 film with the board-game buried under the sand on a beach, it is discovered once again. Neglected by its finder, the game transfers into that of an obsolete video-game system which is jump-started by four students serving detention at a local high-school. From that point, they all are sucked into the world of Jumanji and embody their respective avatars they choose to serve as in the game. Keeping this spoiler free, the premise within the game itself is nothing special or original in the least. The players are tasked with finding a certain sacred object of which they must journey and deliver to at a certain sacred place in order to return to the real-world. They all have their respective strengths, weaknesses and abilities which they must use and work together while on their journey. The plot may be simple, but it serves its purpose well enough.2. This movie should be the blueprint for future comedies to show that raunchy, vulgar and excessive sexual humor isn't always necessary in making a film funny and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the same as I did with the original as a kid growing up. Though the presence of the late Robin Williams will surely be missed, I think he'd be proud of this film. Williams was a comedic genius during his time, but the humor delivered by both Jack Black (Prof. Osbern) and Kevin Hart ('Mouse' Finbar) will have your stomach in knots. Black in particular steals the show more so than Kevin Hart, seeing as his charter is embodied by the self-centered teenage girl Bethany (Madison Iseman). Black's acting and portrayal of his real-life counter-part was nothing short of outstanding. His gestures and voice in particular sold me on him being a girl trapped in a man's body. Don't get me wrong, Kevin Hart has his laugh-out-loud moments as well.3. The action was surprisingly good for a family film. I'm not sure how well younger audiences will fare watching this as there are some frightening sequences as well as brief sexual references and innuendos throughout. Unlike the first, this sequel is PG-13 as it takes certain and surprising liberties I wasn't expecting it to. Whenever there's action....call Dwayne Johnson, who literally delivers a knock-out punch with his performance as the daring Dr. Bravestone. I must say, I enjoyed Johnson's comedic chops in this more than any other film I've seen him in thus far. Never having been a fan of the Jonas Brothers back in the day, Nick Jonas (Alex) actaully surprised me as to how good of an actor he is. I used to cringe at his acting during his Disney channel run, but I'm glad to see he's finally bettered himself. I suppose there's no point in hiding my undying love for Karen Gillan. She's beautiful, deadly, funny and a joy to watch on screen.4. My only complaint and first major flaw of this film is the villain. Bobby Cannavale has proven himself as a good actor, but here he falters as the treacherous hunter/explorer Van Pelt. This movie would have been close to perfect had they not failed to include a worthy antagonist. Van Pelt could have been played by any actor to be honest. The character himself is weak and his goal is like any other cliche in which he wants the thing which the heroes have so he hunts them down to get back the thing that will give him power instead of the other thing happening. Apart from that, the cinematography and editing was phenomenal in this. The breathtaking scenery and shots of the various Hawaiian isles blew me away. Though not as cinematic in scope as 'Kong: Skull Island', it still urges me to want to visit Hawaii. If there was one other minor thing the film was weak in was the score. I felt Henry Jackman could have composed music more exciting.With his last film being the atrocious 'Sex Tape', Jake Kasdan has redeemed himself and proven to also be a good action director. If you're hoping this film to be a tribute to Robin Williams in some way, it really isn't, although it mentions subtle ties to the first. 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is by far one of the best comedies this year and is certainly on my top 10 list of best movies of 2017.","

"mohdaqif","2 April 2018","I was watched this movie 3 months ago on East Coast Mall and it was wonderful movie. This is the best The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) movie i ever seen since The Rundown (2003). Kevin Hart's also great too. Jack Black was good, Karen Gillan was great too. This movie is the sequel of 1995 of the same film staring Robin Williams, who died in 2014, causing suicide by hanging. I also like Robin Williams since Patch Adams and RV (2006). I haven't seen Mrs. Doubtfire yet, but I will watch it very soon. I also watch the original film, it was the great movie.I wonder don't why people hate this movie because this is not Jumanji. Well, I like this film, it was a funny movie. Just for it, my cousin's sister paid us RM 17 for movie tickets. I laugh this part because Kevin hart ate the cake, causing the explode.This is my favorite film 2017 since Baby Driver, Abang Long Fadil 2, John Wick Chapter 2, Spider-Man Homecoming and Wonder Woman. I hope this movie will have a sequel.","

"funnycommentor","18 July 2023","I have to admit, when I first watched ""Jumanji"" (1995) I really enjoyed that movie and I was so hyped about the sequel! Eventually, the sequel was as good as the original movie and I definitely enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and kinda similar to the previous movie. The storyline was very well written, kinda different than the original movie and everything was well-explained, however it was kinda simple and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, kinda well-developed and really likeable. In my opinion, that movie had a better filming location (jungle, Hawaii) instead of the previous movie's filming location. The casting was really GOOD and their acting was perfect, everyone portrayed their character amazingly well. Also, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and full of epic chase/fight scenes. The opening scene was kinda unpredictable and it was definitely promising. The ending scene was kinda unexpected and it was definitely really good. Moreover, the cinematography and the CGI effects of the movie were INCREDIBLE. Overall, it was an enjoyable sequel, very funny, adventurous and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.","

It is a good concept in adventure genre, the movie is interesting. It is a very good combination of Adventure and comedy, although Adventure dominates the plot and most of the movie but mild comedy kicks in every know and then making it ideal for the viewers.","

"AngelFall1n","22 June 2021","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a good comedy, but that's all there is to it. It's not a sequel to the first Jumanji that I know and grew up with, but more of a modern video-game concept instead of the actual board game. I think it kind of defeats the point of the origin story and why the game was there in the first place. The scenery and costumes were well done. It could have had much potential in regards to the storyline, but the actors still did a great job. Good family comedy film.","

"TxMike","30 March 2018","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library.The 1995 Jumanji had a quite different story, and at the end the last scene shows the Jumanji game box in the sand, on a beach, for another unsuspecting person to find it.The current version shows that scene and some 20 years after the first it is updated to reflect modern times. Four high school students are in after-school detention, for four unrelated reasons. One of them finds an old electronic game box, they manage to hook it up to an old TV, then proceed to each select a Jumanji game character. Upon completion each is sucked into the fictional reality of the Jumanji world where they have to elude beasts and other dangers, and find a way to correct a wrongdoing to save Jumanji.Just fun entertainment, the most enjoyment is from each character. For example a meek geek boy becomes a muscular fighter (The Rock) while a large football player called The Fridge becomes a short weekling (Kevin Hart). One of the girls becomes a man (Jack Black) and marvels at the extra body part she now has.Well made and fun entertainment. Much of it shot in beautiful Hawaii.","

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8 November 2019","The original Jumanji (1995) back in the mid 1990s was a phenomenon in itself. It may have not smashed records like that of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) or Jurassic Park (1993), but it was also no underground film that went totally under the radar. Many fans remember it fondly for not only having likable characters and an interesting story, but also because of the lasting impression it left. While Jumanji was marketed as a family film, it definitely had some rather intense moments. When a sequel was announced to this film, somehow the reaction wasn't as largely lambasted. Probably majority of people were curious as to how such a feat could be pulled off. To everyone's surprise, things went better than expected, especially with respect to other game to movie adaptations.Directed by Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher (2011) and Sex Tape (2014)) and writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers (The Lego Batman Movie (2017)), Scott Rosenberg (Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)) and Jeff Pinkner (The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)) all penning the script put together a sequel that remarkably matches up the original. Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman) and Martha (Morgan Turner) are all everyday high school students. Spencer's a nerd, Fridge is an athlete, Bethany is the popular girl and Martha is not. After they all receive detention for disobeying their teachers, they discover the Jumanji game in the form of a video game in the room they sit. It is there they discover there's more to the game than just something to use their time. Once inside the game, is when things get uniquely comical.Spencer becomes the macho Dr. ""Smolder"" Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Fridge turns into Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) and Bethany, to her shock is now Professor Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (Jack Black). And what makes the plot to this sequel a worthy follow-up is because of how it changes the scenario for everyone involved. Unlike the original where the game turned its surrounding environment into the jungle, here the people playing the game get transported into the game (which is a jungle). On top of that, the four main stars are also not turning in performances they usually fit the mold too. Johnson, Black, Gillan and Hart all have to play the younger actors' personalities and not their own. While some mannerisms are kept the same, seeing the veteran actors act like teenagers is very different.This leads to some very comedic scenes revolving around their situation. It's all opposites as to how they looked in real life. However aside from the physical aspect, the characters also have other moments to develop and learn to work as a team. There's also appearances from Nick Jonas and Bobby Cannavale who plays Van Pelt (the villain from the original movie). Most of the time replacing an already existing character would constitute as bad continuity, but here there's a justifiable reason as to why Van Pelt is being played by another actor, so it's okay. However one thing that does need to be addressed, is more use of the lesser known stars. Yes, having Jack Black, Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan and Kevin Hart star does help, but it would be nice to see more attention given to the younger actors. There's also the whole thing about how the story continues after this....it is rather definitive.As for visuals, the cinematography was handled by Gyula Pados. For what's shown, it looks great. The backgrounds are lush green and the inside scope of Jumanji looks vast and wide. Pados seems to know how to handle this based on the fact that he also shot for other big landscape films like Predators (2010) and Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015). Lastly, the film score composed by Henry Jackman was well done too. Jackman has lent his talents to all genres like Monsters Vs. Aliens (2009), Kick-Ass (2010) and Winnie the Pooh (2011), so it shows that he can handle not only more tender moments but also lively action sequences too. While he doesn't reprise the creepy theme of James Horner's score, he does create a new one that fits the tone and it is repeated throughout.While the younger actors don't get as much time to shine, nor does this sequel really leave it open to more stories, this sequel is definitely on point with its predecessor. The action/comedy mix well, the scenario has the main leads challenge their performance skills, the cinematography is lit fantastically and the music is a welcome addition to franchise.","

"Abdulxoxo","13 February 2021","This movie reverses the whole concept of the original, instead of stuff coming out of the game, this time stuff goes into the game. We then find ourselves in Jumanji with the four teenagers who have now turned into their avatars. After getting over the initial shock of the situation, they realise that each of their characters have unique strengths and weaknesses and they must work together and use their abilities to complete the game in order to go home. The actual plot wasn't as terrible and sort of worked as a loose sequel to the original. The scenario plays out like a computer game which which was pretty cool and mostly well done. Like a computer game each character gets a certain number of lives. There were also details like non-player characters repeating certain phrases because they only have very specific roles to play in the game. I thought that side of the film was well written. However it's the performances that make this movie so good. In particular Jack Black, who almost steals the whole film. His impressions of a teenage girl in a middle-aged man's body were hilarious. We know he's a funny physical actor and he takes full advantage in this film to have fun with the scenario. Dwayne Johnson is also really good. His characters real life persona of Spencer is a geek who's afraid of everything. Yet that kid is now in Johnson's body with the strength and charisma of Bravestone, who literally smoulders. Kevin Hart is also hilarious. Karen Gillan doesn't exactly play against type, but she does become a badass character who is also very funny especially when trying to flirt.
On the whole, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is packed full of both terrific action and comedy, and superb performances.","

"view_and_review","24 December 2017","22 years after Jumanji debuted it has been redone (well, it can be considered a sequel). Normally, I'm so apprehensive about remakes and sequels because they're simply never as good as the original. But this time I was extremely hopeful because the trailers were so good. In fact, the trailers were too good. The various trailers gave away the first quarter of the movie. There wasn't a punchline in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie except that I'd already seen it. That still left 75% or more of the movie to be viewed untainted but it did suck to be watching reruns at the start. I guess that's the catch 22. Because the trailers were so good I committed to watch it, yet those same trailers stole some of my enjoyment.Still, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a clever remake. Instead of a board game it's now a video game and instead of all of the events occurring within your surroundings the player is drawn into the game. The movie provided plenty of laughs courtesy of Kevin Hart followed by Jack Black. As a story it made sense and flowed well. I still think the original is better but this was a good tribute.","

"Howlin Wolf","27 May 2018","Tremendous fun.Who would have thought that I'd find Kevin Hart to be the most amusing, of the troupe?!I see Jack Black getting all the praise, and whilst he is hilarious, taking on the mind of a teenage girl is an immediately funny conceit; Kevin Hart really sells the lines and makes them funnier then they might be with somebody else's reading, so I'm going to give him some credit, too.Dwayne Johnson also demonstrates once again how effective he is, when it comes to playing brawny guys who conceal a sensitive side.I feel like this is a genuine, crowdpleasing entertainment, of the kind that Hollywood has been unable to deliver properly, in some years (somewhere around 1996, as it happens... What are the odds? :-) )","

"martin-807-452270","3 January 2018","So...Jumanji - Welcome to the jungle.***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***I totally loved the original Jumanji, can't believe it's over 20 years old! I remember watching the herd of rhino crashing through the town centre and being incredibly impressed with the CGI and all that nonsense, and it was actually touching how Robin Williams' family had suffered after his disappearance. Was a great film and I re-watched it recently in preparation for this sequel and it is still an excellent film.I really liked this new movie - it's very well made, quite funny and superbly paced. Loved it. If (like me) you've ever played D&D then this is about as close as you'll ever get I suppose. Anyone who has played a Computer game or RPG should love it and let's face it that's quite a big market.Karen Gillen is particularly good, after such small roles in Guardians of the Galaxy she deserved a more prominent role. Jack Black is excellent and the Dwayne The Rock is, um just the Rock with more asides than usual.Some awesome CGI and imaginative camera work really made this film for me. It did deserve a slightly better polish on the script and some of the plot points could have done with a nudge, but on the whole I thought it was great. I'd watch it again.But now I need a third part when we discover who made the game and why... Or maybe I don't need a prequel at all and sometimes things can just be because that's how things are.4.5/5 Excellent fun.","

"DKosty123","27 December 2017","With Jack Black and Kevin Hart, comedy is to be expected here. This adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's book is that and a whole lot more. The action carries the film at a steady pace. It is a satisfying adventure from start to finish. Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan (Guardians Of The Galaxy) create a strong top 4 with excellent support. Do not compare this with the 1995 film, sequel it is not.Overall, this film carries itself well. Enjoy the ride this movie offers. It starts with the finding of the game, everyone getting sucked into the contest, and then the playing of the game in order to get everyone to win the game and escape. It is an amazing game, so well scripted that the audience enjoys it instead of looking for more than it is. The film at 1 minute under 2 hours is just about perfect.There's lots action and plenty of plot to keep everyone aware of what they are aiming for. I never saw the 1st film and after seeing this one, I see no reason to as this one holds it's own with any film. Adventure is the key to success here and the script and cast bring it allin.","

"fletcherc21","21 December 2017","This sequel essentially only brings the name and concept of getting trapped in a game from the original. It is essentially an action heavy version of The Breakfast Club, as four high schoolers from different social groups are all in detention together and get sucked into the game. Along the way they grow and develop and move past their differences and realize they need to work together to get out of the game. The core of the movie is simple body swap comedy, which they all do well, but Jack Black excels in particular as a shallow self obsessed teenage girl trapped in Jack Black's body. The plot is essentially a video game, reminiscent of Tomb Raider or Uncharted, but used as a vehicle for humorous moments. The humor plays to all ages with jokes targeted at kids and jokes for adults. The adult jokes were mostly about flirting and social interactions with very few of them being sexual. There was only one joke that the 7 year old next to me felt the need to ask his mom about, but it was subtle enough that she could just move past it. There was also not a single fart or poop joke, which is a miracle in a modern comedy.This sequel is one of the few that actually surpasses the original, which was scarier for kids and not as funny for everyone else. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is the action comedy that leans on the comedy and is actually funny without being crude.","

"expertocrede","15 November 2020","I think I have watched a simple and cheap teenager movie which is from 2005. The story is so strong for a nice film but I am afraid they could not use correctly. Although visual effects are not outstanding if you want to choice like fantastic movie. Seems like producer did not want to spend money for this movie I sense an intense lack of quality and cheapness. Character introduction is pretty crucial in movies like this because we watch a loser men-women and apparently they improve themselves with time but I didn't take proper information before the action especially for girl. And then suddenly plot point 1 was over, they included the game. After that time during 20 minutes we watch the sexy girl joke. The story is never going on in that times. After the first scenes of motorbiker guys we watch billions of scenes which are trying to make epic. Al the time with increasing music sound, somebody explore himself and decide to become self-confident person, 5 minutes later again I watch the same thing . At least 4-5 scenes are like this. I have never watched a regularly rising of character story. Because of this reason I don't feel any signal of victory before the resolution part of script.Frankly, I like the game-inside point only. Rest of the movie don't satisfy me, if you want to spend time with your children you can choose it otherwise no need for watching.","

Rant over, when I heard they were making this film I was worried as the original with Robin Williams and a young Kirsten Dunst was so good. I needn't have worried as this is even better. A brilliant cast of Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are so likeable they totally make this film so brilliant.They get materialised into a computer game during detention and have to save Jumanji form the nasty Van Pelt.It's such a fun film with dare I say it a touch of melacholy which all great films should have.

It is sad to see none of the original actors or characters from the film but then again, that was over 20 years ago, so we can't really blame them. I still miss Robin Williams. I like the idea of updating the story into a video game and there are tons of amusing moments in this movie. The characters are really quite likeable especially Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black. The special effects could probably be better, but they're still nice.This movie really does have a lot of heart to it and I found myself rooting for the characters at the end. The ending is quite heartwarming and it feels well deserved for everybody. I admit I don't like the idea of all the creatures being inside the game and not coming out. We still get a lot of great jokes and playful jabs at video games in general. I was annoyed at how none of the creatures from the original film appeared in this. I mean, it is the same Jumanji as the original, right? ***","

The story is unique with four teenagers get sucked into the video game and turn into the video game characters. I really like the four actors performance with the amount of humor they give out and how they act like the teenagers who they supposed to be. The movie is both great being a comedy and action with how it was executed. The comedy is funny with the actors and the video game logic it presented here. It contains a lot of funny moments and line from the characters of the movie and is entertaining to watch. The action is both enjoyable and suspenseful with the amount of action it presented here. Also, it contains a lot of great special effects and CGI in it. As for the characters, they are developed really well and have strong relationship to each of them.One flaw I have is one part of the ending that I still question about.","

To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, and change the way they think about themselves - or they'll be stuck in the game forever.........Having never been a fan of the first film, I wasn't so keen on seeing this, but due to them having some brilliant chemistry on screen and off, Johnson and Hart sold the film for me, especially with the fact that the former has to play against type as a nerdy guy trapped in the mans body.Lest to say, the overall outcome is a tepid sequel that owes more to Raiders Of The Lost Ark than the original movie.The main problem is that although the cast do well in depicting their teenage counterparts, those teenagers are rather unlikable, even though they all have life lessons taught to them throughout the film.Hart is wasted in this, he feels really restrained in this, and whereas he bounced of Johnson in Central Intelligence, the chemistry here is non existant, and could have been a crucial part to the films narrative.Gillan is good, but she's nothing more than a Lara Croft wannabe who is good at dance fighting, even though the choice of song is terrible.And then there is Black, I've never been a fan of the man, he became too self aware after School Of Rock, but he redeemed himself with Bernie slightly. Here, it's back to basics with him, chewing scenery with every breath he takes, sucking the life out of everything he's doing. And the humour regarding his character is a little too smutty for my liking and really feels out of place in the film.Action wise, it's adequate enough, there are a coup,e of good set pieces that pass the time, but all in all, it felt all a bit 'is that it?' Once the film reached its climax.Add a villain that could have easily been avoided, and you have a damp squib of a film that really disappoints.","

"Yossy_yan","21 August 2018","In 1995, the movie Jumanji came to screens, starring the great Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst.
The same idea, but then the whole game actually took place in the world of the children who played the game.
And it was an amazing movie.This film is completely different, more ""technological"" .
I enjoyed this movie very much, just as amazing as the original movie.Jack Black and Kevin Hart, two amazing actors, each time making me laugh again.
There's nothing to talk about Dwayne Johnson ... and Karen Gillan .... amazing.A film that can be summed up in one word: FUN","

"bobb480624","28 June 2019","Not having watched Jumanji since the Robin Williams one when it first came out, I didn't know what to expect. My lovely friend said that there were avatars and boy, there were avatars!The kid actors were great, however seeing the Rock with his eyebrow move made me laugh. Jack Black playing a girl in his body - hilarious, especially going to the loo! Kevin Hart as the slow, shouldn't eat cake valet, playing the height card didn't get old. And Karen Gillan trying to flirt looked like me when I tried!And I totally forgot about the metal head in the beginning so that was a good wrap up. Nick Jonas was another good actor. And Colin Hanks at the end? I cried when he said ""we named her after the girl that saved my life"". Yes, I'm soppy.It's not going to win Oscars for acting and Robin Williams is probably laughing rather than turning wherever he is.Give it a watch. You never know. You may find a funny bone where you least expect it.","

"tavm","27 January 2018","After several weeks of not watching this movie, I finally saw it with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously enjoyed this. I, myself, had never seen the previous Jumanji starring Robin Williams so I wasn't aware of the rules of the game from that one so anything reveled in this one was new to me. Anyway, I quite enjoyed both the adventure and some of the humorous touches sprinkled throughout the movie. So I'm very glad to have finally seen Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.","

"karanshingre","29 December 2017","Jumanji 2 was an awesome movie. It was better than Jumanji 1. When I sat in the theater to watch it, there was laughter everywhere. The movie was really funny. I thought all the funny parts would be in the trailer but not in this movie. In Jumanji 2, 4 characters get stuck in a jungle. Each character has 3 lives. They need to put a stone in a statue to go back home.
 When I went to the the theaters to watch this movie, the line was very long but it was worth waiting. The movie was the funniest I have ever seen. There was lot's of action but also a lot of humor. Laughs came everywhere. 
 Clearly, I thought the movie was amazing. There was humor, action, and a story. You should watch Jumanji 2.","

"masonfisk","5 September 2018","Not being a particular fan of the 1995 original starring Robin Williams & Kirsten Dunst (really the CG was all the rage at the time), this reboot from Jake Kasdan (son of Lawrence) & director of few notables here & there (Orange County is one that comes to mind) this huge hit from last year starring the Rock, Jack Black, Karen Gillan & the loud Kevin Hart is a rather timid affair. Whereas the original used the actual home of the players to stage the gameplay run amok, this version shoots the action in Hawaii, I believe, for God knows what reason & still have critters of the CG kind terrorize our players as if that makes any kind of difference. The sequel has already been scheduled for release next year but if I do happen to revisit this franchise, I'll watch it at home.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","27 December 2017","'Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle (2017)' relies almost solely on its central body-swapping conceit, which elevates it above several other action-comedies with a similarly broad 'save the day' story. The fantastic, against-type acting really is great fun. The four major stars easily pass as simple avatars for the 'real', more-or-less teenage cast who actually get sucked into the titular game. You actually forget that you're watching Dwayne Johnson instead of Alex Wolff. The film isn't hilarious but it's funny enough, humorously milking its video-game setting and unexpected characters for all they're worth. When it gets going, it's very enjoyable. It isn't exactly deep, but - if you're willing to go with it - it's entertaining, crowd-pleasing fluff. Plus, it actually does a decent job with character development. The action is exciting, the comedy is chuckle-worthy and the acting is surprisingly good. 7/10Note: This is a heavily edited version of a previously written review.","

"tadpole-596-918256","3 January 2018",". . . there was first a children's book called JUMANJI, and then a family film titled the same. I do not believe that Japan's Sony Pictures was involved with either project. I vaguely recall the book was about a wholesome American board game, and the scariest thing about the original Made-in-the-USA flick involved kids on flying carpets in some sort of meteor shower. Before being subverted by Japanese propagandists, JUMANJI was not a wall-to-wall product placement vehicle for Asian motorcycles. It should go without saying that the original genuine American JUMANJI book and movie did NOT involve high school gals suddenly sprouting lizards, and then needing ten-minute lessons from the born-as-boys crowd on how to drain them. This insidious Sony Trojan Horse retains just enough of the trappings from the beloved U.S. original to sucker citizens into squandering their resources at theaters in our own Homeland in order to pervert our precious kiddies by filling their minds with smut and filth. Shame on Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for allowing this to happen!","

"jamesba-640-753446","7 May 2018","I went in this film with the lowest expectations and the film managed to surprise me. It deserves and 8/10 for it's fun but is definitely a 6/10 film.It was a fun adventure film and I can't help but think that this would be reviewed favorably if it did not have the Jumanji name attached. This is a fact that does annoys me, and impacted my expectations.The first act of the film is dull, a clear rip off of the Breakfast Club, and gives the convoluted reason why this is a Jumanji film. Unfortunately, the first characters introduced are one dimensional and unlikable , you can see their arc from miles away. The film picks up quickly once our ""heroes"" finally gets to Jumanji and is the turning point. In testament to the setup, the characters do retain their traits throughout the movie, which was a shock considering the caliber of actors in the film, sorry Dwayne.This film succeeds due to it's comedy, which is on point for the most part and is driven by Jack Black. It was also helped by the fact that Kevin Hart is subdued, a wise decision as he is typically insufferable. Jack Black is finally back to his best, as he has been poor for many years and is the stand out part of the movie.The plot of the film is ludicrous and full holes, merely there to support the comedy but you don't mind as the comedy is spot-on. The action is acceptable and keeps the viewer engaged for the most part.This film is not a work of genius and doesn't pretend to be and is partly the reason it works. It doesn't have interesting visuals, a complex plot, terribly great acting but it is excellent fun and I would recommend to anyone looking to fill 2 hours.","

"Quinoa1984","23 December 2017","Heres one you can chalk up to low expectations, but a movie with the unfortunate title of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (and look I get it, people still remember the song and it plays with a trailer, but it doesn't play as far as anything remotely clever) is an enjoyable experience. This all comes down to who is involved and, for the most part, how the director uses his cast and resources.Jake Kasdan is not especially known for big Hollywood spectacle on a 100 mil budget (whatever it is if it has Dwayne Johnson and it's *under* 100 mil that's an achievement), but he is known for, to varying degrees of success, his work in comedies like Orange County and the underrated Walk Hard. Kasdan isnt a Joe Johnston, who directed the first moderately successful/hey-its-not-some-nostalgic-classic-its-alright original, so he only has a competent sense of action and effects (theyre not *bad* theyre just competent and adequate and thats fine). What he does have in spades is the ability to get good work out of actors ready to stretch themselves just a little, and thats what you get here with an additional treat: video game meta(ish)ness.In other words, if you pay attention to movies currently and have seen what The Rock and Kevin Hart and (to a smaller extent) Jack Black have done in movies, this subverts that since the concept opens it up; the pitch is almost like, I dunno, Breakfast Club meets Tron but, of course, in a jungle, as four teens (dorks, jock, popular girl, et al) get stuck in a video game during detention and take on avatars of Johnson, Hart, the lovely Karen Gillan and Black and have to take on a mission all aren't quite ready for. Though this does leave us with seeing arcs play out with the original teen actors bookending the movie, they're solid arcs for what is at heart a kids comedy, and it's a comedy that banks on us knowing at least some (if not a lot more) of how we see these actors, for the most part, and what happens when Johnson has to play afraid of everything and Hart is a football star who has his stated video game character ""weakness"" as ""Speed"". Woops.Thats the other thing, on the whole, this movie understands video games likely more than 99% of other video game movies (if one wants to count Scott Pilgrim vs the World as one, and I would up to a point, thats the only one that really digs deep into understanding and satitirizing video games, at least until Ready Player One comes out, that I can think of). When we get a flashback, for example, of Bobby Cannavale's sneering weird-iris-eyed villain's origin a character explains to another that this is what's called a ""cut scene."" There are also life bars on the characters' arms and the uncertainty about what will happen if all the bars are gone and if that means actual death, not just dead-and-come-back, is not a plot hole so much as it works as genuine ambiguity for what these people are in to and for us. And, again, every major actor here is up to so the double work of playing these teen types and what their video game avatars are supposed to do (ie Black's Bethany is a cartographer, to which she states at one point shes a map ""doctor"", so to speak I guess).This is a genuinely clever, funny script that shows Kasdan's skill at mining for comedy based on everything the premise can give him. And it provides a lot for everyone in the cast (save maybe Cannave, who is better than this but whatever he's screen presency) to dig in to, and the arcs for them while a bit obvious are worthwhile and the message of looking past the types into what makes you stronger or more confident or just not, well, a dick to people or others (ie Bethanys self-centeredness or Fridge's stand-offish 'i dont need to study' aspect), works. This doesnt mean everything is as funny as it should be, which is why I said ""for the most part"" before; Jack Black is given one note to play as ""ugh""-y teen narcissist and it gets a bit tiring when there isn't something completely genius for him to say (which is often). It's to the point where, and I never thought I'd say this, Hart gets more or just stronger comedic material than Black does, or knows how to use how we see him to an advantage or whathaveyou. There's also a fifth character midway through that provides some story intrigue and more stakes (it also is a good move via set up and pay off from the opening of the film which may/may not be following up off the original, dont know doesnt matter) and he is serviceable as an actor but doesn't stand out like everyone elae does.This might just be grading on a curve since its far from anything great and isn't without some logical jumps to make - yes, I say this, for a Jumanj maybe standalone rebooquel - such as a thing that happens with a life exchange that just happens and is never properly explained (I'm not sure without spoiling it I can recall seeing a multi-player game where that was a thing, though I must admit I haven't been avid as a gamer in a while), and again the action and actual spectacle is only impressive inasmuch as what's there as Kasdan as competence but not an original or striking vision (perhaps the one perk to Johnston over the next gen director, albeit time and money have changed the quality of effects). But if you are curious in the slightest and the trailer didn't turn you off and like Johnson and Gillan and most of the folks involved in making this, you may be surprised to see people who give a damn about what they're doing and the lines they say and how their characters develop within the limitations of a children's fantasy adventure. It's the B side once you're done this season with Star Wars's A-side record.","

"Cinemaniac1984","4 January 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was an amazingly fun movie from start to finish. I honestly thought that it wasn't going to hold a candle to the 1995 classic with Robin Williams and that it was going to crash and burn at the box office. How wrong I was. I had a great time, and there were plenty of laughs. This movie fits perfectly into the modern day era with a lot of updated aspects of the story as well as a completely new cast.The movie starts off with in 1996, when teenager Alex (Mason Guccione) is given the Jumanji board game after his father discovers it on a beach following the events of the previous movie where it was dropped into a river. Alex is originally uninterested with the game however once he finds that it has transformed into a video game cartridge, he starts to play it. Alex then disappears and is never seen again. Fast forward to 2017 where teenagers Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman), and Martha (Morgan Turner) are unceremoniously given detention and their principal orders them to clean out a storage area at the school as punishment. Upon discovering the same video game cartridge, the four teenagers start to play the game and find themselves sucked into the world of Jumanji. To their horror, the teenagers find themselves as the four characters they picked to play the game. Spencer is the muscular explorer Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Fridge is the short zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Martha is the lethal commando Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Bethany is the overweight cartographer Dr. Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). The four characters are polar opposites to the teenagers. Spencer is a weak willed nerd who is academically clever, Fridge is the tall football jock who shows no interest in school, Bethany is beautiful but very self centered, and Martha is socially awkward. As their four respective characters, they learn from their guide Nigel (Rhys Darby) that to survive the world of Jumanji they must band together to complete the game. They also have to battle the possessed evil explorer Russel Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale).You couldn't have picked a diverse cast with Dwayne Johnson (San Andreas), Jack Black (Tropic Thunder), Kevin Hart (Ride Along) and Karen Gillan (Guardians of the Galaxy). All four are awesome in their respective roles and fit into the movie perfectly. Rhys Darby (Flight of the Concords) does a good job in his small role as the guide Nigel. I still think of Jonathan Hyde's Van Pelt from the original Jumanji movie however Bobby Cannavale (Boardwalk Empire) takes up a different version of Van Pelt in this movie and runs with it.As I said at the start, I didn't have much faith in this movie after being indifferent to Jumanji being resurrected. I didn't think much of the original trailer either. After rewatching the original movie which I have loved since I was 12 years old, I came across the trailer to the new movie and decided to give it a second go. I was completely wrong in thinking that this was going to be a box office failure. I was in absolute surprise to see how fun this movie was going to be. And it was absolutely fun from start to finish.If you liked the original Jumanji, you will not be disappointed. If you haven't seen the original Jumanji, still watch it. If you seek adventure, I guarantee you will have an amazing time. Sit back and have a blast.8/10.","

It's not exactly high art, but Jack Black was pretty funny as the teen girl stuck in a fat man's body and The Rock did a good job playing the nervous nerd with the mega physique. The villain was pointless and a huge waste of Bobby C. but there was a nice touch about having confidence in yourself that worked as minor pathos. Better than I was expecting.","

"Sophie_89","1 January 2019","When i first started watching this I thought I can't sit through two hours of these incredibily annoying teenagers, but then they changed into other characters when they got sucked into the game. I loved how they were all polar opposites of themselves in real life - the nerdy girl became a hot, high-kicking warrior, the nerdy guy became The Rock, the massive football player became the weedy side-kick and, in my opinion, the funniest of them all, the self-obsessed beauty queen became Jack Black! My jaw hurt from laughing so much at Jack Black playing a selfie-obsessed teenage girl! The adult actors were believeable in their portrayals of both their teenage characters and their characters in the Jumanji game. I'm always sceptical of these remakes of classic films but this one did not disappoint, thank you for not ruining the original!","

"cruise01","23 December 2017","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun comedy action film that has a great ensemble like Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan. And a whole lot of action to keep you entertained. Now does it succeed over the original film that has the beloved Robin Williams? No, I still loved the original film and also because the idea of a board game bringing real threats to the world from big spiders, a herd of elephants breaking through a house, and a flash storm in the living room. I thought this film was still good and fun. And it is a sequel to the original. But once you hear the jumanji drum rolls it sure does bring back memories from the original. The film starts with a teenager finding a board game on the beach in 1996. However, like he said, who plays board games and sets it aside as he continues to play video games. Overnight, the teen disappears and all is left is a jumanji video game. Now, 20 or so years later, Spencer (Alex Wolff), Bethany (Madison Iseman), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), and Martha (Morgan Turner) are all on detention in high school and are suppose to clean up the basement. Til they discover a Jumanji video game. They play and get thrown into the world of Jumanji as avatars like Dr. Smolder (Dwayne Johnson), Shelly (Jack Black), Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Mouse (Kevin Hart). They have to play the game and search for the missing eye of Jumanji to break the curse.The film is a lot of fun and it has some fun humor. Alex Wolff playing the nerdy teen. Madison Iseman playing a self centered popular teen, which she is obsessed with taking selfies and posting it. Ser'Darius Blain a jocky student. And Morgan Turner plays the awkward teen, who is sheltered from everyone. Then, the avatar versions of these characters like Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Kevin Hart were all fun and great. There is some exciting fun action as these characters travel the world of Jumanji. Being chased by the villain Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) biker goons as they are on the search for the eye. With a beastly Johnson punching guys through walls, and Karen Gillan dance fighting skills. They make a great combo. Black is more of a navigator with map reading skills and Hart is a weapon specialist. It is interesting to see how the world of Jumanji is. But at the same time, I miss the original idea of a board game coming to life. This film has action, bad guys chasing the good on motorcycles. The good guys walking through each stage of the game from death trap hallways, a stampede of rhinos and a helicopter chase, and being chased by Jaguars. If this film were a stand alone, it would have been better with no comparison. There is also some fun humor with these characters. Penis jokes on one male character that a girl is playing as. And seeing Jack Black teaching Karen Gillan how to flirt was hilarious. There is plenty of more with these characters. Overall, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a good action adventure film. It is a fun addition to the original. The cast was great. It has plenty of action and humor to keep you entertained. The plot was also good seeing the world of Jumanji and modernizing the game as a video game. But nowhere as great as the original.I rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend seeing the film in theatres it is fun for the whole family if you seen the original or not.","

"niallmaggs","5 January 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a (apparent) sequel to the 1995 classic Jumanji starring Robin Williams, surrounding a mysterious board game. The 2017 film has the same premise, except this time it's not a board game, but a video game from the 90's.Four students at a school receive detentions for different reasons, and end up together having to staple booklets. Spencer (Alex Wolf) discovers an old video game called 'Jumanji', the students set up the game and play it, but end up being sucked in, turning them into the form of the characters they chose. Spencer's character takes the form of Dwayne Johnson. The other characters actors' consist of Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black. From here onwards, there is non stop fun, action, great humour, and a glorious soundtrack!The premise here really works well. The plot takes unexpected twists and turns that keeps the audience on their toes. But what makes it thrive, is the great chemistry between the actors, in particular Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart; this type of chemistry can't be scripted. The one liners exchanged between both are hilarious and they work really well together. We'll definitely be seeing these two together in more movies in the future. It's not just these two that have great chemistry, Karen Gillan and Jack Black also really fit in with Johnson and Hart. All of them each have their own style and bring something different to the crew, Whether it's Johnson's charisma, Hart's comedy or Gillan's striking looks, there is something for everybody to enjoy in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.And trust me, Karen Gillan isn't just there for her beauty, she's hilarious and a vital asset to the rest of the team. All of her scenes are memorable, whether she's dancing to Big Mountain's Baby, I Love Your Way while beating soldiers up, or taking flirting advice from Jack Black, she's constantly the star among the popular likes of Dwayne Johnson, which demonstrates her strength as an actor if she can outdo The Rock! Her performance is brilliant, and the video game character is a complete opposite to the real life Martha, played by Morgan Turner. In real life she's shy, anxious and unpopular. However in the game she's a complete badass! The way the filmmakers handled each character is really great. The tough Spencer is a nerdy guy in real life. Completely different to Fridge (Kevin Hart) who is a strong, tough, popular football player, but in the game, he's quite cowardly, small and weak. This aspect I really liked.Henry Jackman's score is used really effectively. Every scene benefited with the heart pounding music. In particular, there is a lot of sequences where the tension and suspense is just incredible. The score also resembles the whole jungle premise, making the scenes feel real and not just seem like a movie set. The sound still stayed a reasonable volume and you can still hear the dialogue. In a lot of films, the booming sound is unpleasant, but in Jumanji the music is a great addition to the already-intense scenes.The action was almost non stop. You're on the edge of your seat constantly and there is a great supply of thrills. The action direction was also very good. The lack of shaky-cam worked well, and even when it was used, the scene wasn't ever jarring or jerking. The sequences stayed enjoyable and you CAN actually see what's going on. These types of scenes were also shot brilliantly and the cinematography was simple but effective.There were some instances where a couple of scenes went on for too long however, and the runtime could've been shortened by about fifteen minutes. The pace was also sometimes clunky and jumpy. It rushes the ending but spends too long on a couple of scenes in the second act. However, the majority of the film stays consistent and smooth.There is also a lack of character development, and there are no real arcs to follow. We don't see any of the characters change throughout except for the end scene, but there is no gradual shift of attitude toward each other, they just start off disliking each other one moment; then just start loving each other...The film also suffers from a painfully weak villain, who we learn very little about nor do we know why he's there in the first place. He isn't particularly fear inducing or scary, and is just a complete cruel idiot for no reason whatsoever. The climax is also rushed, underwhelming and a slight let-down.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is great fun and the comedy is brilliant and clever. The actors are excellent and their perfect for their role; they're most definitely likeable! The action is great and so's the chemistry between the characters, but does suffer from typical action clichés, however in the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is absolutely great!","

"undeaddt","13 April 2020","It is a fun movie, goes straight in the comedy genre, combined with adventure, but that is all that it is to say about it. Yes, Kevin Hart is hilarious and The Rock is not bad either, but it is building up to the legacy of the original in a way I did not want to. The original is very different from this one, I'd say darker, with more serious moments along the way, while this is solely for the comedy lovers. I would recommend it, but it is nothing special.","

"FelipeCarrillo","30 December 2017","Art is the quality, activity or product executed from the fruit of skills, keeping a core artistic and communicative purpose, an own idea that is materialized through different resources predisposed by humans that ends up influencing what people think and feel, a way of expressing, a way of manifesting. Over the years, the evolution of man has stirred up the emersion of disparate disciplines, always focused on the aesthetic conception overlaid by the time, which were established as Arts, they were officially enumerated by Ricciotto Cuckold in 1911; dance, music and poetry form a reserved list of expressions whose basis is the exhibition of personal thought in response to the events of the world, each of these intervened, of course, by the perceptions and styles of the artist, thus placing originality, imagination and creativity as cardinal tools. Within this prodigious series of acts is the one which, personally, I consider the mother of all arts: cinema, clearly. The Seventh Art, as many call it, is capable of encompassing any of the traditional arts disseminated by human senses, it manages to join movements, narrations, colors and melodies by means of picture and sound. Precisely, an audio-(sound, hearing) visual (vision) experience represents the perfect mold, one in which each individual takes the role of emitter and receiver. From its birth on 28 December 1895 from the hand of the Lumière brothers to my latest showing on 28 December 2018 have passed 123 years of stories, biographies, tales, loves and disappointments, betrayals and loyalties, surprises and speeches; cinematic annals raised by masterpieces, debuts, sequels, trilogies or octologies from different men and women who show intimate insights on millions of screens around the world weekly, creating a range of universes that have written, officially, the highly controversial History of Film. At this point, today, it's revealed the difficulty of each release hitting cinemas to add something fruitfully n brand-new to the Book of Celluloid. More than half of them culminate in either average or deeply deceptive flicks, being only a small minority which gets to take a place, at least, in golden headlines from the best of the year, here, the actor germ: the lack of originality. This problem, sharply commented by this reviewer, affected and continues to affect the creative minds of Hollywood, the cinematic power that being on the brink of the abyss, opts to reuse, literally, proposals from the past, using new faces to get a new audience who shows interest in seeing more of the same, then, Will we get to the point where cinema establishes a unique series of stories on which the thousands of filmmakers work? We pray for no more recycling of ideas.Within the culture broth that has become American cinema, lies adaptation, remake, reboot and continuation; ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" drinks from these four disadvantaged categories. A hybrid that becomes an adaptation of the mythical reference book, a remake of the legacy and mythology of 90's story, a reboot of the time and customs in which the tale develops, a sequel when posing a contemporary plot with a fascinating twist, and even reaches to play with homage in certain fragments that venerate the motion picture from twenty-two years ago. With sufficient controversy and critic, more non-exemplary ideas are cooking up, desperately, with major studios as sponsors, while, quietly and gradually, small indie productions are dedicated to being such small minority.Jake Kasdan directs the flick that means the kick off for a possible needless saga of stories that, according to the grossing at the box office - which are predicted favorable -, will have the chance of arriving in the years to come. Basically, the mythology is preserved, a mythical board game in which every roll of the dice means a drastic change in the real world of the players, however, the variable in the declared sequel reverses the rules, it's founded on the transporting of the players inside the game - now video game cassettes - personified by the sexiest, most hilarious and requested movie stars of today. So far, everything looks interesting and potentially functional, however, this game is missing pieces. The script starts to waver hardly in the introduction of the new batch of actors, some high school boys who fit perfectly in the stereotyped juvenile roles, only, to pour them in the cloned characters of modern cinema. Although the film takes its time presenting the four young protagonists, the spectator never gets good vibes with any of them due to a lousy and clichéd sketch of characters, their attitudes fall into the abhorrent common places and end up in those same places. It's worth highlighting the high level of predictability that the script shows, it's possible to anticipate each move that story is going to execute, besides, adding a poor chemistry and charm between the quartet of the young characters. In the first act, there is a framing in which the four are seated side by side awaiting their punishment, however, there is an empty chair, opening the opportunity to foreshadow the sudden appearance of the character that would become the comic relief, but not, It's just an empty chair until the half the footage, at least, a pinch of subversion. Likewise, we shouldn't expect any kind of identification with the plastic avatars in the jungle-themed game, equally pigeonholed in the roles of strength, intelligence, beauty and stupidity; nor with an antagonist who allows different disgusting insects come out from inside his ears or mouth. Yeah man, the film knows how to build up ephemeral situations in which the vis comica of each one of them pops up, nevertheless, it never touches the same emotional, comical and even sinister dimensions of the feature film directed by Joe Johnston, where we watched a newcomer Kirsten Dunst along with the acting master Robin Williams. It's indisputable that thanks to the busiest and most popular cast, led by the always hilarious Jack Black, the story remains standing and manages to stretch a dynamic and kinetic pace as much as possible, however, it does by an odious predictability and some visual landscapes that don't exploit the huge possibilities that they held in their hands, even though most of the locations are real places (Hawaii) and its special medium-level digital effects. As is customary in these types of proposals, the film is as chaotic as the situations it exhibits due to traditional symptoms, that are hidden behind all the creative process. The first and main trigger is the number of screenwriters, four writers proposing and laughing at an executive table while they prepare a cocktail of dramatic and sidesplitting moments as unequally functional as necessarily witty. Chris McKenna, the man behind ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" and ""The LEGO Batman Movie"" - two of the superhero jewels of the year - was responsible for writing the global story, but apparently, it seems to have left all his powerful ideas in his previous works. Leaning ingeniously and respectfully on the world of video games, the central plot follows a traditional structure and doesn't provide eminent strangeness that should be the salvation key for this kind of movies, those that set up its stories more in the humor of the situations than in the humor of tale as such. As a strong point, a cunning, subtle play around the video-game-themed background, the screenwriters gave with an ingenious magical formula to overturn the storylines or the different settings of newfangled video game consoles with, of course, a narrative and parody purpose, however, many of these situations work well, even though the film is riddled with them.Jake Kasdan's ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" brings together three of the funniest movie stars of the moment, one ""Doctor Who"" Scottish actress and one former member of the American pop-rock band Jonas Brothers to deliver a free-entertainment film with the exact doses of nostalgia and new content, devoid of any drop of true originality, but brimming with one-liners and comical moments that follows the proper procedures of the typical mega-studio productions in the genre. A funny follow-up to close a year of surprising cinema of just quality, therefore, simply stays in that way, in a correct and admissible time killer, not something really substantial. One more play in the lucrative game called Hollywood. A game, just that.","

"Darryl_Lazakar01","24 December 2017","Wow, just when you thought this movie will bomb... When it was first announced, everyone has low expectations for the stand-alone sequel to the late Robin Williams's 1995 hit. Everyone believes it's going to be a massive failure..Then BOOM! Defying everyone's expectations, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a surprisingly fun, enjoyable movie, that manages to stay true to the originals, while at the same time, might be one of the best video game movie so far.For starters, Dwayne Johnson once again proves that he's likable in every role he recieves, and his role as Smolder Bravestone speaks for itself. Kevin Hart literally plays himself, and he did a great job as Franklin Finbar. Karen Gillan did a great job as Ruby Roundhouse, despite being in a uncomfortable (and controversial) outfit. Jack Black is also really good in his role as Oberon. Nick Jonas also did a good job as Seaplane. The teenagers (Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Morgan Turner, and Madison Iseman, playing the real-life counterparts of Dwayne, Kevin, Karen, and Jack's characters respectively) did a great job as well.One of the things that made this movie works really well, is the ""fish-out-of-the-water"" story. Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan, all play a role that's not familiar to them, and they really did a great job. The pacing is perfect, explaining the plot right off the bat, resulting in a more fleshed out and more interesting story. Also, as the game is essentially a video game movie, there were plenty of video game references that some people might don't get it, but for those who understands, I think that it's a great throwback and a cool easter egg as well. The humor in this movie, it works perfectly. There's surprisingly plenty of sex jokes that works, but also not overused. The fight scenes are also very entertaining and over the top too (again, it's a ""video game"" movie, real life physics don't apply).Unfortunately, the movie does suffer from several aspects. The villain, played by Bobby Cannavale who btw did a good performance, like any other movie, is a simple, 1D character, who is simply evil. Though can be menacing, it doesn't change the fact that he's nothing more than some really evil guy who wants to rule everything and destroy anything stands in this way, etc. I also noticed that Kevin Hart's character is the only one of the main characters that is, seemingly not affected by the fish-out-of-the-water situation. I wish Kevin's performance were more out of his usual persona/fish-out-of-the-water performance, rather than playing as himself. Also, Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan has little to no chemistry whatsoever in their really odd awkward romance subplot, and the movie didn't take the more risky route, which is a shame since the final act is, personally, is kinda anticlimactic.Nevertheless, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle proves that Hollywood actually can make a good sequel to the old classics that brings something new to the table, while at the same time stays true to the originals. Fans of the original movie, while could be dissatisfied by the change from the board game to a video game, should watch this movie and came out satisfied, because I believe Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle captures the spirit of the original very well, and I'm really happy that it's actually really good and not just a bad attempt at milking money.Final Score: 8/10","

"metztex","24 March 2018","Spoilers are minor. No major plot give a ways. This film was very entertaining for me. While not as good as the original with Robin Williams, this film does provide a fresh updated look to the story line without compromising the precedent set in the previous film (unlike Last Jedi). Jack Black does an incredible job in this film and found myself laughing up a storm throughout. The Rock does well too but I could tell he was struggling a little with his character which is understandable and certainly not unforgivable. Bottom line, the Rock still did well. Main items I liked...Concept of teamwork!!! This true in everyday life. The struggles of two of characters to find their confidence in themselves is very well played and is great to see that gender is not considered in this area (it never should and is really irrelevant). Nicely done.On the flip side..bringing the other two down to earth into the real world from off their supposed high pedestals was also very nicely done. The football star suddenly stripped of his physical prowess and forced to deal with what most individuals have to on a day to day basis was very well done. Additionally, bringing the popular girl and placing her in a man's body for a time without all the modern toys of her cyberspace life was very entertaining. Granted I grew up in during the time before the internet, let alone ubiquitous cell phone availability, so from my point of view, it is hilarious! If you like action adventure movies with comedy mixed in, and you liked the first Jumangi, chances are you will like this film. I found it entertaining with few slow or distracting sub-plots.","

"Troy_Campbell","27 December 2017","Technically a sequel, but realistically a soft reboot, Jumanji 2.0 takes the central concept of the original and transforms it into an action-adventure outing for its digitally-savvy audience. Board games are out and video games are in. It won't win any awards for screenwriting with it's predictable and plodding plot-high school stereotypes must save the titular game-world by returning a stolen jewel-however the team of scribes get one big tick; the introduction of a body swap conceit generates consistent laughs. In fact, the broad comedy is consistently (and surprisingly) excellent. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit, sure, but the combination of the cast's comedic timing and their willingness to poke fun at themselves is a winning formula that absolutely shines through. Dwayne Johnson is his usual likable self as jungle explorer Dr Smolder Bravestone, Karen Gillan is a crack-up as the awkward bad-ass Ruby Roundhouse, Kevin Hart gives good Kevin Hart as sidekick Mouse Finbar, and Jack Black unequivocally steals the show as an egotistical ""hot-girl"" stuck in the body of overweight, middle-aged man Professor Shelly Oberon. The set pieces are decent without ever really impressing, the raft of winks and nods to the 1995 version earning enough goodwill to let the lack of originality slide for two-thirds of the movie. The final act, however, becomes quite the slog to get through as the comedy is swept aside in favour of an action finale full of poor CGI, unmemorable sequences and an overacting Bobby Canavale as the sneering villain. A flawed action movie, but a good-quality laugh-at-loud comedy, Jumanji is the epitome of Boxing Day family flick: dumb but hilarious, messy but entertaining.","

"Prismark10","4 April 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is belated sequel/reimagining of the 1995 film Jumanji. There is a loose link to the character played by Robin Williams in the original.Jumanji was known for its CGI wild animal stampede, however this film shows how much CGI has come on from those days.The film starts off a little like The Breakfast Club as four diverse high school kids get detention and come across an old video console containing the Jumanji video game. The teenagers get transported into another dimension where they become video game characters different to their real world counterparts.Spencer the nerdy gamer becomes the muscular Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) with no weaknesses. Fridge, his big football playing former friend becomes Bravestone's sidekick and zoologist, Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart) who must avoid cake. Narcissistic 'it' girl Bethany becomes chubby and turns into cartographer Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black.) Clever but insular Martha turns into a kick ass Lara Croft type adventurer, Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan.)The characters must work together to save Jumanji by returning a stolen artefact while encountering various dangers and henchmen.This is a comedy adventure with some video game tropes. I always felt that the original Jumanji was a rather clumsy fantasy adventure which did not get the comedy balance right.It helps that Johnson and Hart have worked together previously and riff off each other. Director Jake Kasdan, whose father Lawrence Kasdan wrote some of the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies makes something more than a cynical adventure film. He allows some character growth, such as Spencer and Martha coming close as themselves although there is a moment where Dr Bravestone does wonder if it would be better to stay as the avatar in a video game.An entertaining film which kids would especially enjoy.","

"Fluke_Skywalker","21 February 2018","Plot; Four kids serving detention after school find an old video game system that pulls them in and makes them players in the game. Of the top-10 grossing (domestic) films released in '17, five were super hero/comic book based and one was a Star Wars film. Debuting strong and having exceptional stamina at the box office (currently sitting @ #5 and likely to pass Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 for the #4 slot within the next week), this (kinda) sequel to 1995's Jumanji clearly scratched an itch for moviegoers looking for a different kind of popcorn adventure. It's not that it's original in any meaningful way, but it's fresh by virtue of the characters not wearing capes or wielding lightsabers. Hitting its marks and checking off most of the requisite genre boxes, Juamnji: Welcome to the Jungle delivers a reasonably entertaining 2 hrs. thanks in no small part to its talented and game cast. If all that sounds like a backhanded compliment... .","

I especially liked the ""heated"" moments, where things got serious & effervescent, because there was where the action really happened. Teenagers who learned to burst their ""comfort - zone"" bubble, got some teamwork skills and managed to successfully complete the game and return to the real life.

"jboothmillard","14 January 2018","The original Jumanji is one of my favourite movies of my childhood, I remember seeing it twice in the cinema, so it was surprising to find out there would be either a sequel or a reboot, having seen a couple of trailers I was certainly interested, directed by Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher). Basically it opens in 1996, in Brantford, New Hampshire, teenager Alex Vreeke (Mason Guccione) is given the board game Jumanji by his father, after it buried in the sand on a beach. Alex ignores it, being a board game, but in the night the game magically transforms into a video game cartridge, when he plays it, he is teleported into the game. Twenty years later, four students at Brantford High School are in detention, Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff) who is caught writing essays for Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain), who is also in detention for the plagiarism, while Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman) and Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner) have been disrespectful towards teachers. Principal Bentley (Marc Evan Jackson) ridicules the four teenagers and assigns them to clean up the basement, specifically removing staples from hundreds of magazines ready for recycling. The four find an old video games console, and Jumanji, the multiplayer action-adventure video game, they decide to play, each choosing one of the four playable character avatars, the fifth one is inaccessible, when Spencer hits Start, the four are sucked into the game. They find themselves in the jungle, each now in their game avatars, Spencer is now tough, muscular explorer Dr. Xander ""Smolder"" Bravestone (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), Fridge is short zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart) (he misread the name as ""Moose""), Martha is gorgeous commando and martial art expert Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Bethany is an overweight, male cartographer named Professor Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (Jack Black). They realise they have been transported into the video game, they each have three lives, each of their avatars have a set of skills and weaknesses, and if they lose, they will actually die. They meet the game's non-player character guide Nigel (Rhys Darby) who explains their mission, with a backstory; big-game hunter Russel Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) wants to obtain the ""Jaguar's Eye"", a jewel that controls all animal life in the jungle. To win the game and go home, the players must return the jewel to an enormous jaguar statue and call out ""Jumanji"". Along the way, the group begins to lose lives through various means when completing levels in the game, but they work together to obtain the clues and continue on, whilst also trying to get away from the various creatures, and Van Pelt's men. The group are rescued in a game level by Alex (Nick Jonas), the fifth player, his avatar is pilot Jefferson ""Seaplane"" McDonough, he has been staying in a treehouse, built by Jumanji player Alan Parrish, because he has only one remaining life, Alex is shocked to learn that he has been trapped in the game for twenty years, the newcomers vow to help him get out. In the next level, they commandeer a helicopter and fly for the jaguar statue to return the Jaguar's Eye, upon landing Alex loses his last life after a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs CPR in time, transferring one of her lives to Alex, saving him from dying. The group arrive at the statue, they find themselves surrounded by Van Pelt's forces and predatory guards, the five players working together, using their resources and skills, to distract the villains. The jewel is successfully returned to the statue, and they all call ""Jumanji"", the game ends, Van Pelt disintegrates into many rats, and the players return home, back to their former selves. Back in the real world, Alex is not with the other four, returning home, they find Vreeke household is no longer derelict, they find Alex (Colin Hanks) is now an adult, he was transported back to 1996, history was changed, and he is now married with a daughter named Bethany, in honour of the one who saved his life. In the end, Spencer and Fridge reconcile their friendship, Bethany becomes a better person with more socialising, and Martha starts dating Spencer, the four friends hear Jumanji's drumbeat in the school, they destroy it with a bowling ball to prevent anyone playing it again. Also starring Missi Pyle as Coach Web and Tim Matheson as Old Man Vreeke. Johnson also producing is always the reliable action hero, Hart and Black provide the laughs, and Gillan caused controversy with her costume, tiny shorts and a low-cut top, she is sexy and good at being the tough chick. This stand-alone sequel does reference the original, and has a nice tribute to former star Robin Williams, but it can be counted as its own movie, this one relies more on the laughs, the storyline is patchy but just about engages you, I really think it could have done with more danger, more creature encounters, but the special effects are done well, all in all it is a relatively fun action adventure comedy. Worth watching!","

"ayoreinf","25 December 2017","The original Jumanji is one of my all time favorites, of its genre. Mostly because on top of being a very effective kid fantasy movie, it uses cinematic language in a way that calls for very careful viewing. Something I didn't expect, and loved finding. (I always love this sort of a surprise). You won't find this clever usage of cinematic language in this one, but eventually it does make up for ir in a more straight forward manner, while not being any less clever. This one is a very well done movie. Superb acting, even though its often done in an underhanded style or maybe I should use the term subtle in this case. Anyhow, the greatest acting bits aren't obvious or spectacular, but are still there. When Dwayne Johnson ""smolders"", when Jack Black is being Bethany, when Karen Gillan is being Martha. I can't say any more without revealing too much, see the movie - you'll understand what I'm speaking about. Beyond the acting, this one is very carefully crafted to force actual teamwork, not just an instinctive support that was there in abundance in the original movie. In this one the group actually plans its moves repeatedly. I'm not saying there's no instinctive ""light bulb"" moments, but they too come as part of the story - it's a very well written story. The pacing, the editing, the CGI, and all other technical aspects of the movie are well above par. Bottom line - great fun movie with some added value to boot. Go see it, you'll have a blast.","

"MovieHead123","8 March 2018","I was skeptical at first because sequels usually turn out to be a disappointment, hence Mean Girls 2 and every Scream movie after the original one. I can name so many sequels in where I thought to myself, ""The should have just stopped after the first one"". I thought I'd feel the same way about Jumanji 2 Welcome To The Jungle, especially since the first one is one of the best movies of all time. It is a movie i shared with my daughter in hopes that it'd bring as much joy to her as it did to me as a child. Robin Williams and Kristin Dunst, talk about two of the most recognized actors in the 90's. Robin Williams played a big role in my childhood, as he brought so much laughter into my home with all of his movies, such as Mrs. Doubtfire, Ferngully, Aladdin, etc. He's the only celebrity who I've shed tears for when hearing the tragic news of his death (besides Anton Yelchin, that one hit me pretty hard too). Anyway, back to the point. You could see why my expectations for the second Jumanji were just ""blah"" so to speak. Boy, was I wrong! Of course, it doesn't compare to the original. However, it is absolutely hilarious and very entertaining. Not one dull moment. I LOVED IT! I could not stop laughing. I also choked up a bit in the end when grownup Alex tells Bethany that he named his daughter after the girl who saved his life. I always enjoy watching Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson. I love Kevin Hart as an actor, but not a fan of his standup. Anyway, I definitely recommend this movie. I gave it a 10. I gave the original Jumanji a 10 as well. but that's only because I couldn't give it a 20.","

"TheBestMovieYouNeverSaw","21 May 2019","That was an entertaining, yet entirely forgettable dumb action movie, with none of the charm or spectacle of its namesake.
The most spectacular thing about this movie is how forgettable it was. I saw it in the cinema with a friend, and within a year we had both forgotten that we had even seen it.","

"sjalkarjadottir","10 March 2018","... exceeded an expectation that was very low to start with though. I did like the chemistry between the characters, i liked the casting ... and it was an all in all very enjoyable movie.I was not blown away by the story though.. the story and the storytelling was stale and boring. It also seemed not to really know what it was trying to do with the game itself. If it was to be a computer game .. there were only very few and rather annoying snippets of what some computer games are like (like dumb NPCs and so) .. while if it was an adventure movie, those game sections felt out of place. While i liked the idea of it being a computer game, the director did not go the whole way .. and so it wasn t more than a little side feature, easily forgotten and irrelevant.The effects were rather bad in some scenes and OKish in others. CGI is not yet there though .. especially the animals looked very very bad (maybe they were meant to?) and did not blend into the world at all.However ... as i said, the character were good, and the movie as a whole was enjoyable.. just not outstanding.","

"kastri_gr","15 January 2018","Junmaji Welcome to the jungle was a movie i couldn't expect it could be so exciting.The first Jumanji was very good thanks to Robin Williams who in my modest opinion was a very talented actor not only a comedian but this new version of Jumanji it was a pleasant shock for me.To begin with the movie is set first in 1996 when the jumanji board game was found on a beach and later we see the board game transformed to a video game for Atari console.The first person who plays transfered automatically to Jumanji in the jungle as a pilot and he waited there for 20 years until four young people (who were on detention in a highschool for mutlple reasons) found the Jumanji video game and they also transfered to the jungle as adventurous persons with great knowledge.Though someone can expect what he/she will see Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson act very funny in the movie such as Karen Gillan and Kevin Black give an awesome perfomance and i almost forgot the Van Pelt enemy in the Jumanji who is different in this new movie played by Bobby Cannavale.Rumors say that there is an alternative ending in which the Jumanji turns to a mobile application stated by the actress Karen Gillan.For me it is a movie ofcourse not for an oscar nomination but a movie with lots of fun and it is worth to be seen it in the cinema.","

I live how the stars of the movie STAY true to their young characters throughout the entire movie. Jack Black totally pulls off the bright and beautiful Bethany while DJ is somehow always the best Spencer despite his grand physique. I've seen it many more times at home now and still cry at the end when they see Alex. It's a total blast adventure movie and it's great to see how the characters evolved was a result of their adventure together. The best part is that it's a feel good movie because it's week written, full of laughs and ends just how you want it to end.","

"farismatthew-53074","11 January 2018","You know I feel like not enough people say this so looks like it is up to me, Hollywood needs to get original. I have personally watched a lot of the movies coming out recently and while sitting through this one it occurred to me that most of the are just remakes or sequels. why do people even go see these I mean went twice but that's because I take my reviews very seriously and look for minor details. The average person shouldn't be going around watching movies which have no original ideas, I mean you look at something like suicide squad, a great movie btw, and you realize that nothing like that has never been done before. I mean everything about it was original and compared to jumango, or what ever the name for this movie is, you realize that it is just a movie trying to be funny by reusing every joke ever heard. Overall the acting was sub par the worst by far being Jack Black. I had high hopes for him after his performance in Goose Bumps but man he really feel apart i guess. When it comes down to it I would say that if you do see this movie try to sneak in to as to avoid giving another unoriginal movie money.","

"Vartiainen","4 March 2018","You know what, in this age of endless remakes and soft reboots, I actually think that a sequel to Jumanji is not actually all that terrible an idea. I mean, the original 1995 adventure film already hinted at possible sequels with its ending and the story and the world of Jumanji is such that you can tell countless stories with it. Plus, it also has the fact going for it that the original film was not a great one. I mean, it's good and nowadays more than nostalgic, but it's not a masterpiece. There is room for improvement here.And while I do not think that this film surpasses the original, it does come very close to matching it in quality. It keeps the lighthearted, tongue in cheek tone of the original, updates the visuals, changes the story enough to remain interesting, while still wholeheartedly feeling like a Jumanji story.What I liked the most were the actors. The ones playing the actual teenagers were okay, even if their characters are about as three-dimensional as the original Super Mario Bros game. But it's the characters playing the game characters that are the saving grace here. From Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan as two invincible heroes to Jack Black and Kevin Hart as their bumbling sidekicks. The fact that they have to act like they're being controlled by teenagers is admittedly a cheap joke, but it's a joke that keeps on giving. Especially Black as a self-centered queen bee brat.And that's actually the perfect way to sum up the film. Its humour and entertainment value are... cheap... -ish, no way around it, but it's just the right kind of cheap. Perhaps I do miss the more serious moments and actual drama of the original just a little bit, and I cannot say that the film gets modern teenagers particularly well, but on the other hand the action scenes are better, the locations are more interesting and it's simply too much fun to disdain in any meaningful way.Grab a bucket of popcorn, pop a soda, lean back and take a trip to the jungles of Jumanji. Watch out for the hippos.","

It was so much more fun than I imagined it could be. The humour was brilliant and the acting was spot on and you never forgot that the adult faces you know so well are actually the teenagers that started the film, because they play them so well!Also I loved the little details such as in-game characters repeating their lines as it makes you feel like you are a kid again playing a video game as well as watching a great movie. The original was a classic and in my opinion this film took it to the next level with the use of new technology, imagination, a different angle, great writing and as I mentioned, brilliant acting.","

"CANpatbuck3664","31 December 2017","If you play video games and are open to the actors/actresses in this cast, it would be hard not to geek out over this concept. Video game movies are hit and miss at best and maybe this was a new way to help that along. They took an existing property and made it a video game movie. There were cool instances where they brought in aspects of video games that genuinely worked (I liked the non-playable character gag where they can only have a few responses) and then there were other times where it was a little awkward and didn't translate effectively (the concept of the lives was a little clunky, they lost lives falling from some heights and not others and then using CPR to transfer one?). I have to admire their ambition but only partial points for execution.This is an action/comedy geared more towards families than adult audiences. Does it work on that level? I would say yes. The movie isn't hilarious but there were plenty of times where I was chuckling, and it also had some decent action in it. I don't think the movie was exceptional in either area, but it did its job. I did like how they brought in some Indiana Jones style elements too. Using specific traps and the returning the treasure to its rightful place were nice additions and made it feel like it was playing towards an old school adventure movie.I did have a couple of big problems with this movie. I felt like the characters of the kids were way too stereotypical (the awkward nerd, the self-involved pretty girl, the dumb jock etc.). I know that they can't be all completely fresh characters, but they still could have added a little more dimension by going in a different direction. The other is that the movie has some dialogue so bad that it will make you roll your eyes and snicker. I couldn't help but giggle at it (in an unintentionally funny way) and I know the movie is directed at kids but again I think they could have put a little more effort in. Other than playing with this cool idea, I thought the script for this was pretty mediocre. I also had a personal nitpick about more contemporary gaming being not referenced at all but that's admittedly due to the fact I wasn't involved in that era of gaming and I don't have a detailed memory of those type of games.As much as I had a couple of problems with the material, I wouldn't blame any of the main cast for it. Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman and Morgan Turner as Spencer, Fridge, Bethany and Martha were all okay. They didn't really impress me, but I think that was more the material than anything. The adult actors all really sold out. Dwayne Johnson is his usual charming self, Kevin Hart is funny in spurts, Karen Gillan was great in her role and the meta jokes about her character were pretty funny. Jack Black was just short of mugging the entire movie but he was one of the few actors who could have made his part work. The biggest surprise was that I didn't mind Nick Jonas all that much. Bobby Cannavale is a good actor but his villain was so forgettable that it wasn't worth an actor of his calibre.I was psyched going into this movie, the scores across the board were better than expected and I thought the marketing for it was pretty good. I walked out having enjoyed Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle but I did feel like it had the potential to be even better. Its doing well at the box office so maybe I'll like the sequel (if there is one) that much more. I would definitely like to see this cast again with the strong chemistry they had. I'd give it a 7/10.","

"NoPantsBatman","6 January 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, the story of four teenagers, Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman) and Martha (Morgan Turner), who got stuck in a magical video game, which only way out is by finishing the game. It's a good concept, and the director Jake Kasdan delivered it in a funny way.While in the game, the teenagers transform into the characters they selected, which are played by Dwayne Johnson as Spencer, Kevin Hart as Fridge, Jack Black as Bethany and Karen Gillan as Martha. This transformation was a trigger for all of them to start questioning who they really are and to realize some of the problems and correspondent solutions to their problems. With a lot of adventure and a lot of funny moments, the movie definitely was not boring, and even though it had some corny moments, it was very enjoyable.As usual, Kevin Hart didn't disappoint with his humor. I just love seeing this actor in action. In my opinion, he deserved a bit more of screen time, but to be fair, the rest of the actors had to have their own time, and it was well distributed, I didn't feel like some got more attention than others, which is a good thing.Another thing that this movie succeeded to deliver was the feel and experience of a video game with ""real life graphics"". As a gamer, it was really funny to imagine myself in some of their situations. I don't want to spoil, you should see for yourself.Overall, the movie delivers what's intended: a Jumanji sequel. It has a lot of adventure, comedy and some good old life-changing moments. A solid 7 out of 10.","

"wycherleyp-960-470658","4 January 2018","I hate it when Hollywood decided to cash in on a beloved title so I did not go into this film with much hope, 
From the opening scene that was more or less a copy and paste from the ending of the original Jumanji it did not sit well with me.Thankfully this Jumanji film took me by surprise as it turned out to not be a reboot or Evan a sequel but a fresh new take on the game.A updated version of Jumanji that now involves it being a video game and not a board game. With a great cast from Karen Gillan to Dwayne the rock Johnson Jumanji is a brilliant fun film that edges on being a family film with some strong language but used in a comedy style.From the start of the game to the end Jumanji welcome to the jungle is a great start to 2018 and to be honest it's a film that was needed after a awful 2017 for films.With supporting cast from Jack black to kevin Hart Jumanji is a successful new take on a beloved title and I'll admit that I was wrong!","

The action is riddled with well-placed comedy and I did actually find myself laughing out loud. I also found myself sometimes uttering the next line in a very formulaic presentation (""...it's game over, man.."")A fun family action film with a bit of everything. The (comedy) acting is top notch, the action, pace and storyline is very predictable - and it is very, very watchable!","

"blumdeluxe","9 February 2020","""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" tells the story of four teenagers that are sucked into a computer game and have to work together in order to win back their former lives while at the same time adopting to the new roles they've been given in this world full of dangers and threats.It is in a way logical to transfer the classic Jumanji story into modern times by just turning the board into a video game. Apart from the fact that the whole concept of getting sucked into a game seems pretty uncreative to me in general, this is a thought that I understand. The way it is carried out is actually decent. You can watch the movie with less cringe than I've feared, some lines are nice or funny. However, I just don't get rid of the feeling that this is more a cash cow than it is the personal interest of someone to make a good film. The result is your typical Hollywood blockbuster that everyone can live with but no one will call particularly priceworthy or remarkable.All in all this is a decent movie for what it is supposed to be. It is not more and in a way not necessary but you can spend an entertaining evening and forget about it afterwards.","

Why did I cry watching Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle? Story was similar to that of Galaxy Quest (a great favorite of mine). But that's not why I cried. Humour was funny, some of it adolescent, but still funny. Moral of the story was good. All of the actors believable, interestingly complex. But that's not why I cried. I cried because I resonated with the feelings portrayed by the geeky couple. And for me, any movie that moves me to tears is a good movie. This is one that I'll buy and watch again.","

I am 49 and sat down with Mum and Dad and enjoyed it.I think the concept of gaming draws me in because i remember the history of games since i was a teen. It was 8 bit, dodgy little sprites, good tunes and excellent game play. Very basic compared to nowThe character development, humour and teeny romance is good enough.The only thing is that the level of mystery, intrigue and suspence is minimal. There is little depth to the story. I think someone pointed out that the development of the bad guy is pretty thin. CGI is per usual too much and not good enough to grab imagination. This flattens everything for me most of the time.But funny and entertaining. Interesting characters. Plenty of dramatic clichés from Hollywood's store: ""gee, you were ace... Oh really, thanks..."". But i got into the romance and it's good light entertainment.","

"mark.waltz","2 July 2023","If there was ever a movie character whom I wanted to see walk into an open manhole (while constantly on their phone) is the vapid, self-centered character played by Madison Iseman who is beyond annoying to watch. Fortunately she's not on the screen for long, somehow turning into Jack Black as part of an online Jumanji game, but those minutes she is turns out to be worse than a week of detention. Fortunately the other three teenagers don't give motive for total Gen Z hatred, only being just moderately vapid and immature. The follow-up to the 1995 hit took 22 years to come up, only having a few references to the events of the previous film, so it's like a fresh start.The charismatic Dwayne Johnson is the avatar for another one of the characters, amused by his sudden abundance of muscle. They are all the antithesis of who they were in the real world, and it's poetic justice to see the popular girl who shouldn't be popular become the hefty Black, his scream at his reflection a delight. So this one has the characters in the jungle rather than the wildlife in suburbia, and seeing the adult actors acting like teens is added amusement. Black gets eaten by a hippo, gets taught how men urinate, and basically slams social media and mean girls through the character being obsessed with it and defending Iseman's behavior. I didn't feel the need to understand what's beneath the surface. Not as original as its predecessor, but it has its charms, is fast moving and funny, and full of intensity.","

Which essentially made the movie not overly reliant on being a CGI special effects galore.I was initially a bit concerned about having Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black in a movie such as this, but they actually carried the movie quite nicely.If you enjoyed the original ""Jumanji"" movie then you definitely should take the time to watch ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"".","

Not wasting my time with a remake/spin-off that would tarnish an iconic Robin Williams classic. Robin Williams would have begged for a cameo if he'd been alive to read the script. Jack Black playing a teenage girl? HILARIOUS. They managed to build a sequel that not only holds its own against the original, but isn't really a sequel. I wasn't constantly comparing it to the original. Aside from the backbone of the original Jumanji (the name, the character trapped for 20 + years in the game, etc) storyline, they managed to make it better yet still pay homage to the original. I didn't feel like I was watching a rip-off of the first movie. I haven't even watched the 3rd movie yet but I'm already hoping there's plans for a 4th in the works.","

Just as ""Orange County"" director Jake Kasdan lets Johnson poke fun at himself as a nerd cringing inside the physique of a bodybuilder, he has taken it a step farther with Jack Black who ends up in the body of female character. Scratching your head yet? These are examples of the sidesplitting shenanigans that underline this frivolous film. Abetting Jack Black and the Rock in this superficial slapstick are comedian Kevin Hart and actress Karen Gillian. They inhabit characters with whom they share zip. These likable characters make the preposterous premise entertaining. A mysterious videogame console uploads four high school teens and turns them into their gaming avatars. Each comes equipped with skills designed to aid them in an epic scavenger hunt. The time frame of the hunt depends on the participants' luck. Not only do a quartet of writers--Chris McKenna, Jeff Pinker, Scott Rosenberg, and Erik Sommers--segue this sequel to director Joe Johnston's earlier ""Jumanji"" (1995), but they also have reimagined it for contemporary audiences with no patience for board games. ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" amounts to sheer, harebrained hokum from fade-in to fadeout. Everything about this farce is far-fetched. Nothing slows down the headlong momentum, however, during these madcap melodramatics. Like the original Robin Williams movie, this ""Jumanji"" contains a similar frame story, but the writers spend more time on the subsequent story about the four high school kids. Superior computer-generated imagery in some truly outlandish scenes surpasses the primitive CGI in the 1995 film. You'll never forget the crocodile scene! Moreover, a clever premise allows our heroes and heroines to cheat death like immortals! ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" starts on the beach where the 1995 movie heroes buried the board game. In the prologue, a teen digs it up and takes it home. While he is asleep, the durable board game repurposes itself into a video game console. When he plays it, the game hijacks him from his cozy bedroom to an alternate dimension. Twenty years elapse, and the main characters are introduced. Principal Bentley (Marc Evan Jackson of ""Kong: Skull Island"") busts beanpole gamer and germaphobe Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff of ""My Friend Dahmer"") for plagiarism. Spencer wrote an academic paper for his friend, star football player Anthony 'Fridge' Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain of ""Camp X-Ray""), that Spencer had earlier submitted as his own to his gimlet-eyed History teacher. Meanwhile, an annoyed teacher catches self-absorbed, social media-addicted Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman of ""Laid in America"") on her smart phone during an exam. Finally, an introverted nobody, Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner of ""Remember Me""), refuses to exercise during P.E., and she winds up in Bentley's office. Bentley lets them off the hook with detention. Sounds like ""The Breakfast Club?"" Not for long! They must clean up a room littered with trash. Fridge stumbles onto that mysterious console. The four students decide to play this mysterious ""Mortal Combat"" game. Instead, they are morphed into it and emerge on the far side as their avatars. Pusillanimous Spencer is now expedition leader Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) with massive muscles. Towering football champion Fridge finds himself shrunk drastically into pint-sized zoologist Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart of ""Central Intelligence"") who dreads everything. Much to her horror, sexy Bethany takes the form of obese, balding, middle-aged Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black of ""King Kong"") whose expertise is maps. Shy Martha becomes butt-kicking martial arts sensation Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") with a flair for 'dance fighting.'""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" doesn't stray far from the vintage Robin Williams ""Jumanji."" In the original, the son of a shoe manufacturer played the haunted board game, and he vanished into it like so much paranormal dust into a board. Unfortunately, he didn't escape from the magic board game universe as easily as he wanted. After he returned to reality, he contends with a big-game hunter from the past stalking him in his hometown. The hunter traded in his antique rifle for a fully automatic assault rifle and lays waste to modern society as he searches for the hero. Later, a stampede of enormous zoo animals trashed the town. Nevertheless, the son triumphs over adversity. The ""Jumanji"" sequel differs in some respects from its predecessor. More characters play the game, and teamwork pays off as their best strategy. They are dropped from the sky into the jungle ""Predator"" style and ponder the three hashtag tattoos on their wrists that indicate their number of lives. Indeed, our heroes and heroines can die a couple of times, heightening the suspense, when their heroics aren't amusing us. The best thing about the new ""Jumanji"" is its gallery of sympathetic heroes and heroines. Smolder Bravestone, Moose Finbar, Professor Shelly Oberon, and Ruby Roundhouse are as charismatic as the actors and actresses. They are riddled from within by the guilt of their real-life counterparts. For example, you'll laugh at the Rock when he cowers before Kevin Hart. Remember, the man inside Smolder is Spencer, and Spencer is a medicating nerd. The scene where Bethany coaches Ruby about the rudiments of flirting is hysterical. Happily, Kasdan and his writers have given everybody a scene or more to shine. Ultimately, the success of ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is such that Jake Kasdan's comic cliffhanger may constitute more than a sequel but also a reboot! ""Jumanji"" has coined $883 million plus worldwide from a $90 million budget. No studio would dare produce such a blockbuster and sit on a franchise.",NA
