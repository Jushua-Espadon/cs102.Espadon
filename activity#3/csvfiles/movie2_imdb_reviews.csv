"cricketbat","21 October 2022","I was shocked by how much I disliked Black Adam. I didn't really have any expectations for this movie, as the only real knowledge I have about the character comes from the Injustice video game series. However, Black Adam takes all the elements of bad superhero flicks and crams them into one loud & messy movie. While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed.","

"Fluke_Skywalker","6 January 2023","Black Adam is the cinematic equivalent of a tuneless marching band running endless circles around your increasingly throbbing head. The score is omnipresent and oppressive. The action frantic and relentless. The entire thing just keeps beating you over the head until you throw up your hands and surrender. And then it knocks you to the ground and starts kicking you. Ultimately whatever virtues it may have had are buried under the rubble from its nonstop assault on your senses. Watching this film was like boxing a 'roided up octopus.And speaking of 'roided up, The Rock is the fulcrum of this mindless drivel, and with his relative charm buried deep beneath an ever-present and sweaty sneer, the film's only notable asset is extinguished. That the recently announced reboot of the DC Universe renders the entire affair utterly moot is simply the last shovelful of dirt on its grave.From start to finish, Black Adam is an unpleasant experience. Bad script. Bad acting. Bad CGI. Bad movie.","

"martinrobertson300482","13 November 2022","I hoped ""Black Adam"" would be a decent entry in DC's recent output as its linked with ""Shazam"" which might be their best recent movie. But nope. Its another CGI filled dud.On the plus side there is an effort put into the story and Dwayne Johnson and his rediculusly strong shoulders buldging from his costume are 100 percent real amongst all the boring CGI. But all the team building with rubbish characters no one cares about has already been DC's downfall with the justice league, Suicide squad and even that Harley Quinn movie. And it's takes up too much time here too.There's not enough time dedicated to making us care about any of these minor characters and their random powers. Just action, action, action that doesn't matter when you don't care about anyone in the movie.There's some decent gags in the movie I suppose. But overall its just alot of green screen and feels like your watching a computer game instead of a movie. It's more ""Aquaman"" than ""Shazam."" So if you liked that one you'll probably like this.","

"pc95","18 December 2022","Large budgeted and badly disjointed, ""Black Adam"" belongs in the poor category with the likes of ""Justice League"" and ""Superman vs Batman"". The story is hackneyed, and the dialog is eye-rolling with terrible worn out humor. It feels like a bad imitation of better Marvel movies. Its too bad as there are some good costume and character designs. I don't think a an ancient awakened god would be spouting out sarcasm of today hipsters. It is better than WonderWoman 1984, but that's not saying too much. Alot of actoin scenes with not much to show for it, I'd give this one a miss and rate it a low 5/10.","

"stsorrell","18 December 2022","While Dr Fate may have been introduced first in print, for those of us who aren't followers of the comics, Dr Strange is the sorcerer that we identify more with, simply because we got to see him first and certainly with more depth. Everything about Black Adam felt like a low budget remake of Marvel characters. Hawkman even looked similar to Anthony Mackey. Atom Smasher was far too much like Ant Man. Hawkman's compound might as well been Dr Xavier's home for the X Men, complete with the aircraft rising from the front lawn.Like so many others have reviewed, the Justice Society was simply thrown at us as if we were to already understand who they were. There was no character building whatsoever, other than a one or two sentence dialog that tried to briefly explain how they came to be superheroes. It was extremely rushed.As for Black Adam...I usually like Dwayne Johnson's films, but in this one, he was stiff and wooden. The other characters...of course Dr Fate was a standout, but it was as if the writers purposefully wanted us to hate Hawkman. His attitude and cockiness were unbearable, knowing that he would be easily defeated by the likes of Black Adam. Perhaps in my mind, I was comparing him to Marvel's Falcon and his much more personable and likable demeanor. Either way, I just wanted to see him get his ass kicked.All things considered, I was simply underwhelmed. 2022 was not a good year for the superhero genre.","

"ObsessiveCinemaDisorder","28 October 2022","While Black Adam isn't a groundbreaking top-tier superhero film, it is an entertaining superhero movie that makes it up with the charm from star Dwayne Johnson as an anti-hero and guilty pleasures including non-stop action, irreverent humor and a high kill count.Dwayne Johnson carves out his own superhero niche with his anti-hero, a concept which the film wholeheartedly commits to. People die in this movie. My mouth dropped at Black Adam's kill count. As the numbers increased, the movie set itself in a tonal sweet spot that Marvel won't go near and Sony hasn't quite achieved with its Spider-Man villain films. What Black Adam does is downright wrong, but it's entertaining as heck to watch it play out.The current culture has become so comic book literate where the story can just introduce a superhero team, the Justice Society of America, without any introduction. You get to know this team in the midst of the action, wondering about their origin stories or how they got their powers. It works, despite being overly stuffed.Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate is quite the scene-stealer, providing gravitas that grounds the conflict at hand and adds another level of seriousness. He's a fascinating character. I hope for a Doctor Fate solo movie with Pierce Brosnan.Aldis Hodge's Hawkman is a great straight man to Dwayne's Black Adam. The heart of the movie comes from the moral argument between them. One character wholeheartedly believes in killing and the other is completely opposed to it. To quote the Dark Knight, this battle of wills is an unstoppable force meeting an unmovable object.In essence, Hawkman sets up for Dwayne Johnson to be Black Adam. The character doesn't want to back one step from his principles and just doesn't give a rats. It's the best part of the film and often hilarious.The villain was not memorable and was just a big baddie for The Rock to fight in the climax. That said, this villain is no worse than the standard Marvel villain in an origin story.In conclusion, Black Adam is a fun movie for a one-time watch. I enjoyed it with my inner Simpsons Comic Book Guy turned off and had a good time.I suspect I won't have the first time experience on a second watch. The seams would crack. I would see that the young JSA members were cast to appeal to the teen demographic and a boy was placed at the center of the story to appeal to children, and the fact that the same boy does a voice-over in the opening credits is odd. On a second watch, I would realize it was all a bit silly.Dwayne Johnson claims Black Adam as the mark of a new era for DC. The film does feel like a rechristening of the DC universe in a soft reboot type way. Now, the plan seems to be moving away from the Walter Hamada era. It always seemed weird to me how Hamada diverted from Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman stories and just focused on side characters and Elseworld projects.I am glad plans are being made to get the DCEU going again. Dwayne Johnson bringing back Henry Cavill's Superman back to the DCEU is a great marketing idea that will guarantee butts in seats, even though it's hard to picture Dwayne Johnson as a star and producer willingly losing the fight.","

"StantonDrew","17 November 2022","Was this script the result of a 5th grade class project?It starts with some of the weakest, most contrived world-building I've seen. Moves to some appalling acting, from various children and bad guys especially. This gets compounded by some of the worst dialogue since George Lucas last wrote a screenplay.And it just continues to get worse from there.Now I usually enjoy the dumbest nonsense that Dwayne Johnson stars in. Even Skyscraper, Rampage & San Andreas were watchable, despite being dreadful movies. But there is no saving this one.This latest poor effort from DC makes the most braindead Fast & Furious entry look like Shakespeare.Looking at the director's previous credits it should come as no surprise that this movie is just plain bad.","

"ryanpersaud-59415","7 January 2023","Black Adam reminds me a lot of X-Men: Dark Phoenix, in that it feels almost like a studio obligation more than it does a passion project. Every aspect of this movie feels slightly phoned in: from the inclusion of the Justice Society, to the final Act, to most of the performances. There's very little passion or enthusiasm here and by the end of it, I was honestly happy it was over.For such a high profile, big budget release, it's honestly shocking how amateurish this movie is at times. The action sequences are flat out terrible, considering how low the stakes are most of the time (i.e., we know Black Adam is going to defeat 99% of the people on screen), and punctuated with endless slow motion sequences that scream a lack of action film making competence.This movie feels like two (or three) films smashed together. We have Black Adam, we have the fictional country of Kandaq and its struggles, and then we have the Justice Society. I guess these elements keep the film from being totally forgettable, but I couldn't help but feel there was a better way to tell this story.It's also really poorly paced, having at three different moments where I thought it was over, only for another plot point to suddenly become relevant again. The dialog is unreal...it's so stilted and silly at times, like when Hawkman (played by Aldis Hodge) lectures Black Adam about ""extrajudicial killing"" mid flight or the constant groan inducing attempts by Noah Centineo's Atom Smasher to give the film a light hearted, Marvel-esque feel with bad jokes. The worst has to be Amon (Bodhi Sabongui), the son of ""kinda sorta"" heroine Isis (played by Sarah Sahi), whose lines are so bad I can't tell if he's a bad actor or a CG generated being with Chat GPT lines programmed into him. I'm serious.I don't like harping on child actors, by my God, is Bodhi Sabongui bad here. So bad that he actively ruins most scenes he's in. But, to be fair, no one, not even The Rock is particularly good in this movie. I've been hearing praise for Pierce Brosnan, but honestly, his hammy performance was legitimately hilarious to me, especially by the end.This movie isn't all bad. There are some cool sequences and shots, the movie does at least explore the morality of a hero killing people and questions what other movies/comics establish as the ""morally right"" approach. I also liked the not-so-subtle commentary about the Justice Society of America essentially invading the fictional Kandaq (where this film takes place) and telling them they can't have a protector of their own. And, some of the actors are just naturally likeable as well; Hodge and Johnson do have chemistry and had one of the best relationships of the whole movie.But honestly, Black Adam feels like another paint-by-numbers, forgettable superhero flick that represents the end of the failed DCEU experiment. As a huge DC fan, it's sad to see some of these characters get such lame on-screen introductions. It's even sadder to know that this movie will be the last time any of us see Henry Cavill as Superman, which...is frankly quite depressing.","

"HeroOfTomorrow","28 October 2022","There's a moment, mid-way through this monstrosity of a movie, where Hawkman tells Black Adam that ""heroes don't kill people!"" The irony of hearing him say this after they accidentally level several city blocks and create massive collateral damage is so hilariously contradictory, the fact that they don't waste another tired joke on that is astounding.This movie... I really don't know where to start. Characters so paper-thin you can (sometimes literally) see right through them; a structure that continuously has you asking ""when is the story going to start?""; a visual miasma of ridiculously dated CGI (yes, show me the speed ramp/slow down EVERY TIME we see cyclone, that won't get old at all!); a complete lack of backstory (what... is... Hawkman?); a villain who can, apparently, just be ripped in half; and technical errors so egregious, I can't believe the incorrect ADR and absurd editing choices got into the Final Cut without the editor deliberately playing a prank on the audience.And the JOKES. Oh my GOD. So many, and they're all so BAD. Not just bad: they completely deflate all tension. Why should I feel stress for a child character if he's quipping all through the drama?Oh, and remember when the rock had a personality? Pepperidge farm remembers. And Pepperidge farm also remembers when movies made sense. ""Let's put black Adam in a cage forever!"" *five minutes later* ""we need black Adam to save the world! Release him from his cage in a ridiculous slow-motion sequence in which a de-powered Black Adam still manages to beat a dozen armed swat teams at a black site!""And what on earth is Black Adam going to do against SUPERMAN?!What a garbage fire.","

"AdrenalinDragon","28 October 2022","Thought Bland Adam was another misfire for the DCEU Universe. Basically a poor combination of Justice League, Eternals and Shazam! This is a movie I probably won't remember at all in the near future. Too much slo-mo and lack of fun. Pierce Brosnan was probably the highlight as he gives the film a little bit of a spark to the cast of characters.Otherwise very dull characters which you care little about, wonky special effects in places and humour which doesn't work most of the time. Dwayne Johnson has little charisma in this film and I simply didn't care what happened. This was overall kinda bad honestly.3.5/10.","

Didn't all those bad Suicide Squad/Harley Quinn/Joker films tell us that?Rock looks good but old. Is this a one off for the character or do they weave him into the DC Uni. I guess so since Superman showed up.This is a kid's movie, with kid's plotting, very much a wasted movie.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16.","

"HabibieHakim123","20 October 2022","Black Adam is not without its flaws, but i still enjoy the hell out of it, the problem that i have with Black Adam is that i never really buy all the Kahndaq people 100%, in the end i only still buy half of it, but i still fine with it, it's not like their characters are terrible, it just most of the time they are doing just a poor performance except the actress who played the mom and probably Ishmael for the most part, at least i still got some of the laughs from one of them, some of the slower scene was sometimes misplaced including some of the flashback, and some nit picky here and there, the rest of Black Adam is an exciting comic book film that fills with a very impressive battle that also fills with dazzling visual and cool style, Black Adam himself played incredibly well by Dwayne Johnson, he was just unstoppable in the most badass way, Justice Society has just become one of my favorite superhero team specifically in movies, they are fun and they are great, Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all of them are a hit for me, i love every single one of them, though i do wish they have something more with Doctor Fate because i think Pierce Brosnan was just unbelievably good playing the characters, again at least we do still have that one moment, i would love to see Justice Society again in movie maybe even their own movie, i would also love to have a specifically Doctor Fate standalone or a prequel film, and last but not least, the main villain, i think the main villain is doing as fine as most of the hero in the movie, so overall Black Adam is a quite a fun ride, 2 hours did feel quite goes by, an exciting back and forth battle that fills with dazzling visual effect and style, great score, great sound, great performances for most of the cast, being the first original DCEU movie that release in theaters only since WW84, Black Adam is not perfect but it's still great, it's still fun, it's still fascinating, it's still exciting, and i enjoy the hell out of it.","

"masonsaul","22 October 2022","Black Adam certainly has its problems, from it's generic third act (are we really still doing sky beams), terrible villain and very hit and miss humour, however it's still a really fun superhero film thanks to some solid explorations of morality, brief deeper meaning and some ridiculously entertaining superhero fights.Dwayne Johnson gives a great lead performance, restraining his trademark charisma to give a more sombre performance that works. Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo have charming chemistry and are both likeable which makes up for their characters lack of depth or development.However, it's Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate who is definitely the standout with superb dry wit and suave screen presence as well as a surprisingly earnest bond with Aldis Hodge's Hawkman whose stoic and commanding performance makes him inspired casting.Juame Collet-Serra's direction is really good, it lacks an overall voice but makes up for it with plenty of stylish slow motion, needle drops and dynamic camera work. The CG is mostly solid with a fair few weak spots and the music by Lorne Balfe is also really good, extremely epic and operatic in the ways that make everything way more enjoyable.","

"MackMonMay87","10 November 2022","Black Adam is possibly one of the most generic superhero movies ever made. In a year that also gave us Morbius, that's quite a statement to make, but true. For me, Black Adam sits somewhere between being better than Morbius and Love&Thunder, but far from good.Like many of the DCEU movies, it doesn't set up the characters properly or give us the core reasons we should care about these characters and what their theme is. The Rock's likability and natural charisma and charm is wasted on such a serious, dour character like Black Adam. You can sense the restraint The Rock is using to make Black Adam more ominous and less relatable than his typical schtick, and it makes the character feel clunky as a result.Physically, The Rock is perfectly cast and I've said for many years he should play a comic character. He's one of the few major actors that doesn't need to train at all for the role of a superhero and can show up on-set ready to play the part the day-of. But the physical side can only go so far, and there's moments where The Rock tries to batner with some of the side-characters, but still trying to embody the seriousness of Black Adam, and it just comes off as awkward. Overall, this character just doesn't work for him, and a more standard heroic role with more potential for comedy would've been a better fit.The other heroes introduced, The Justice Society, are for the most part as flat and ineffective as Black Adam himself. It really does seem like Black Adam and the rest of the Justice Society should've been introduced in a previous DCEU project. They have the most ridiculously undercooked plan from a group of superheroes I've seen in a long time, and while the movie tries to hint at self-awareness of this through dialogue, that still doesn't make what they're actually doing with the story good. It really more makes the Justice Society look like clowns. Pierce Brosnan is the best performance in the movie, to nobody's surprise, but even then we get so little of why we should care about the JS and who their characters are. I have to give a mention to Cyclone being arguably the most worthless character in a superhero movie ever. Her tactic against Black Adam, a being as strong as Superman, is to toss pipes at him with the wind, and she contributes more or less nothing the rest of the movie.The movie tries to sell Black Adam as an anti-hero, and tries to make attempts at a sort of moral grey-area, but it falls flat. Intergang, the force invading Khandaq, is objectively evil without any redeeming reason to be there, so when Black Adam kills them, there's not really a sense of shock or any moral deliberation. They're remorseless scumbags conquering a country for their resources (Eternium, not only seeming like a blatant rip-off of Black Panther regardless of whichever came first in the comics, but also the most poorly named fictional material since Unobtanium in Avatar), so aside from the act of murder itself, which they bring on themselves by attempting to mortally kill Black Adam, there's really not much of a moral quandary here. Nothing Black Adam does in the movie embodies the ""anti"" part of being an anti-hero. His actions never lead to an innocent person dying or even getting slightly hurt. This is the kind of content missing from something like Black Adam, that could actually drive a sense of consequence and drama, stuff like that is supposed to be the foundation of comic book stories, but they shy away from taking the story there and attempting to tell us who the characters are through goofy dialogue rather than actions.To contrast with Black Adam, look at another former WWE-star in a DC production: John Cena as Peacemaker from his own show with the same name and '21's The Suicide Squad. Peacemaker actually does hold morally questionable views, is introduced to us as a criminal psychopath, and is blatantly antagonistic to the lead character. In his own show, he grows from these aspects of character and becomes less sociopathic, which is interesting to watch. The main difference there is that The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker had the involvement of James Gunn, who actually knows how to craft oddball characters with a sense of love and a way of making even the weirdest characters endearing.Black Adam shows that after all this time, even with some successes in recent years, the DCEU still doesn't consistently know how to craft interesting characters that feel at least somewhat fleshed out in an inter-connected universe. Everything about Black Adam feels as if a machine was given all the typical elements of a modern superhero movie and made to produce one, without any of the heart or regard to character, or what makes the genre really work. It's good enough to not be awful, but not good enough to be memorable.","

"parksiet","23 October 2022","No, the hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the introduction of ""Black Adam"". This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn't take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it's a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn't stop... it's a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It's only problem - it's so average; something we've seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn't great, frankly. But it's still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!So let's get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a ""twist"" near the middle of the film. It's not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who've seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn't try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it's more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to ""The Suicide Squad"" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say ""see look how brutal we can make this"" without actually earning the audience's investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with ""look how powerful and ruthless he is"". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!It's when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that's okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I'd love to see this iteration of the character return. I'm just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson's physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn't here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn't like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad"" and of course a certain cast member from ""Shazam!"". I did love these little connections- it's nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the ""Shazam!"" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It's definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn't stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder's ""300"", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don't even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn't discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn't memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that's okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It's remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- ""Avatar"", ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like ""Venom""... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson's ""Black Adam"", especially in a potential ""Black Adam v. Superman"" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!","

"namob-43673","22 October 2022","In the superhero movie genre I would rank this somewhere in the middle, which of course also means that this is a fantastic movie from a DC-perspective. DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of ""who is really a hero?"" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!","

"AvionPrince16","19 October 2022","What a movie! The special effects are really immersive and really give an immersion to the city Kahndag. We learn more about his story and the way that the whole habitants become slave. Black Adam have a story that become more and more interesting and give some surprises, revelations and a new orientation for the future of Black Adam ( with superman at the end). All the super heroes were awesome to watch by their suit, their powers, their goals and the confrontation between the justice society of America and Black Adam give some interesting theme to talk about: is Black Adam really a vilain? What is a hero? What is his duty? A hero can call himself a hero if he can free their people from slavery even he did bad actions? Where is really the line between vilain and superhero? I mean there were interesting things to talk about and the plot get more and more interesting even if its begin in a classic way: the curse of the wizards to make Black Adam a prisonner and his story have a lot of subtilities when other point of view will discuss about the Black Adam Story and his real intentions (his anger cant be under control and can become a treat but the real vilain who is Ishmael because its a descendant of the ancient king of Khandag and it will tell an other point of view about Black Adam because he saw him cried about a boy who get killed and its in fact was his boy who give him the power. So i mean there was some interesting revelations and surprises and bring more nuances to that Black Adam's character. And all the fights in the movie were pretty great and pretty epic. The justice society and their heroes were great ( special mention to Atom, DR Fate, Hawkman) and with them they will discuss more about what is an hero and how to act like one and not just said an hero its this and that make you an hero: it have more subtility and i really appreciated even if i didnt go watch Black Adam mainly for his story but i appreciate it anyway. It have also some drama moments with DR Fate and Hawkman but Dr Fate will save the world at the cost of his life and give an interesting view that DR Fate's character and give another interest to watch the movie because it really have some surprises and revelations during the whole movie and have no break for us to take during 2 hours and thats a good thing. Im glad that the movie have some subtilities and make him more interesting and thats not a battle about to see who is stronger but just to test the value and their intentions and their motivations and really make them stand out each of them and give interesting duels in spirit and physical (Hawkman and Black Adam).And at the end, maybe a collaboration with Black Adam and Superman? Or a duel? Very good DC Movie and bring a new world in an existed one (Shazam) but give an identity and a story to an hero/vilain character that will make him interesting to watch in next movies.","

"Nob0dy","9 November 2022","""The film initially received an R rating due to several gruesome death scenes and many cuts had to be made to the film to receive the lower PG-13 rating""^ That is all you need to know about this movie. A team of executives, producers, writers a director, an entire team of absurdly over paid people pitched an idea for a movie based on a comic character.They then hired writers to take certain elements and plot lines from the characters long history and make a movie out of it.They then hired directors, the highest paid yet most one dimensional ""actor"" in history to front it.They spent months having re-writes and changes. Spent months filming scenes over and over again. When they were happy with it it was sent to post production where a team of very highly paid people plastered the movie in special effects.They had it in a studio for weeks to months with music being composed, overlayed, sound lines being re-recorded, foley's producing sounds for movements and atmosphere. Then all of the audio was mixed and overlayed in a way they were happy withAnd then what happened? They took a finished product that they were content was a good vehicle to tell the story and completely buthcered it. Removed any scene that had the character acting like the character he is supposed to be, removed any and all scenes that could possibly be deemed as ""too much"" for a child by the ridiculous american MPAA. They watered down and hacked chunks out of their own product to sell more tickets, even though it was already guaranteed to be a financial success since it has the rocks name attached to it. They destroyed a story that they themselves had concocted and the end result is a completely different end product than what was pitched and even different from what was originally filmed it's dumb it is completely and utterly moronic. If you don't want to make an R rated movie and want to make yet another generic child focused brightly coloured, pun filled movie that has about as much depth as an episode of peppa the pig then do that. Don't take a character who historically has had stories revolving around adult themes, shoot an entire movie retaining the essence of the character and then proceeding to intentionally destroy any semblence of that character or the themes you were part of creating in the first place.I don't care for the rock personally, zero acting ability and a selfish attention seeker in real life, but this movie could and should've been good, he can't act at all but he already has the ego and arrogance that could fit this character, instead we get the most generic, predictable and low effort childish movie that DC has ever churned out.","

"kevin_robbins","22 October 2022","Black Adam (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. This storyline follows an ancient being known as Black Adam awaken within some ancient ruins. There is a race to find a historical crown that contains demon powers that is tied to how Black Adam gained his powers. As Black Adam's chaos begins he gains the attention of the Justice Society that will try to contain Black Adam while also thwarted the evil doers trying to get the crown. The question becomes which side will Black Adam take, the side of the evil doers or join forces with the Justice Society?This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (The Rundown), Aldis Hodge (Hidden Figures), Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Mohammed Amer (Mo).It's impossible not to like a super hero movie with this many kill scenes. The Rock is absolutely awesome as Black Adam and his kill scenes are tremendous as are the running jokes tied to the killings. The comedic content overall is pretty solid. The special effects are tremendous and I enjoyed the inclusion of the Justice Society. Aldis Hodge delivers a strong performance as does Jalon Christian (A Journal for Jordan). The storyline is intricate and has some fun twists and turns and I enjoyed the conclusion. The post credits scenes is absolutely awesome too.Overall, this is a very well done addition to the super hero genre with enough unique elements to make it a must see. I would score this a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.","

"winak","16 November 2022","This movie is solely for kids and teens, the rest of us would find the characters, dialogues and concept cheesy at best. With the more established super heroes there is a margin of believability we would like to have. Here with Black Adam it is like fantasy gone wild and so you never connect with these heroes and their ridiculous powers. Sole dependance on CGI to make a movie is not a great strategy. Dwayne, besides displaying his bulk there wasn't much to like about the Black Adam. I don't know how Pierce Brosnan got roped in, but he looked as out of place as Jim Carrey would look in an action movie. It was almost like he was there as a spoof to all superheroes. While the Atom Smasher guy's uniform looked almost identical to Deadpool and his growing into a giant looks just like what Antman does. Feel sorry for DC as they are desperately trying to compete with Marvel and losing terribly. I don't see this movie growing into a franchise as Dwayne Johnson would lose all credibility as an action hero if he continues with this drivel.","

I cringed, that ruined the whole tone of the movie for me. The whole levitating thing got on my nerves too, I think Adam sat down once. I just didn't understand the need to levitate so much. The kid with the skateboard was cookie cutter Disney silly, trying to be funny and not, he just got on my nerves. This movie just ended up being silly and I couldn't wait for it to end. The whole super hero movie has to stop, its just too much and getting old. The whole tone was all wrong. It could have been great, but ended up being a three star buy the end of it.","

"Zac_La_Porte","9 November 2022","Black Adam feels like a Marvel movie, except it cares more about how ""cool"" its CGI and action is, which gets in the way of a properly thought-out story and sufficient entertainment. To sum this movie up in one (or two) simple words, it's just completely pointless. Have movie celebrities, actors, directors, writers, producers and storytellers all lost their motivation for big comic book characters that fans actually care about? If they can't come up with good ideas and an actual plot, they may as well just dump the whole project instead of providing people with disappointingly boring action.It's completely undeniable that Black Adam is a blockbuster, considering the nearly $200 million budget and the very well-constructed, fast at times action. Despite excellent costume design for the main superheroes in this movie, as well as the cinematically awesome sound effects and visual work put into the action sequences, this is an incredibly flat, pointless and majorly boring action flick that wastes it cast's potential, opportunity and money. If you care about thematic aspects, Black Adam does take a few breaks to discuss the meanings of being a hero and being a villain, but that's really about it.Story-wise, there's nothing to say or talk about, because there's absolutely no thought for what the film is meant to be about. Again, the fantasy action is done almost impeccably, but it's ruined by the fact that since it has no plot or character development to fill in the gaps, there's flat dialogue and even more action to just pile it up into a long borefest of a mess. The entire thing is convoluted and you can feel every minute of it... Well, at least until the final third where you can feel every millisecond of it.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

I don't know where the Justice League came from or why. Are they the good guys? I don't know. Is Black Adam is a good guy or a bad guy? Beats me. I get that it doesn't have to be black/white, good/bad. But I should have some sense of these character's motivations and goals and purpose but I have none. Zero, zip.

"johnspringer-95440","15 February 2023","Black Adam is so formulaic and predictable that even the gigantic action spectacle becomes tedious before the end of the first act. The mostly no-name characters are cardboard cutouts of the supporting cast of every superhero film in the last 10 years. There's wise mentor old guy, team leader conflicted about following orders guy, overpowered youngster learning to harness her abilities girl, and AntMan - er, comedy relief can turn gigantic guy. There's generic bad dude bent on world domination, of course, plus sassy damsel, her precocious kid and secondary comedy-relief brother. As for Black Adam himself, there's a hint of an interesting story but it (along with any semblance of a plot) gets quickly buried and then easily resolved to make way for pointless action. And I do mean pointless, as in people with no reason and/or capacity to injure one another punching each other through buildings for an hour. Is this a terrible or hateful movie? No. It's just not very interesting or entertaining.","

"ScreenGenius","3 February 2023","Black Adam is steadfastly average for a superhero/supervillain movie. There were many places where the story was obviously weak due to lazy writing, which contributed to an overall plot that was predictable and boring. Some scenes were downright goofy and cringe. The fight scenes were actually decent and the final fight scene better. But as a villain origin story compared to the hero origin story Man of Steel, this movie was a miss.The Rock portrayed Black Adam adequately, but I don't think this role really suits him. He is best as the comedic hero that everyone is rooting for. Black Adam is a darker villain, so his acting style doesn't really align. That said, he did do a decent job, but by comparison to its closest counterpart, Man of Steel, this movie just felt like a lesser experience.","

"rtbradford","29 October 2022","I was looking forward to this flick, but it was simply awful. If you've seen the clips, you've seen all the best parts of the movie. I wasn't looking for Oscar quality, but at least some semblance of a plot. And I've read plenty of comic books in my day, so I know what a decent comic book plot is like.Visually, the movie was almost entirely CGI and it wasn't the best CGI either. The Rock basically did a few scenes where he showed an angry facial expression and the rest was CGI. And the story, if you can call it that, was sloppy. For example, how does a long dead guy in what I assume is somewhere in the Middle East get resurrected speaking perfect American English? And why does the Justice Society just attack him without finding out his story?The movie was so bad even my 13 year old son left the theater saying it was one of the worst movies he's ever seen. Hawkman was the one redeeming aspect of the movie. It was nice to see him introduced to the DC cinematic universe.If you want to see it, best to wait until it comes out to stream at home for a few bucks.","

"FeastMode","20 October 2022","I knew nothing of Black Adam going in so it was pretty cool to discover who he is and what he's about. This is a fast-paced and fun movie with some good action scenes. The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/20/2022)","

But it doesn't try to be that either.It was fun, enjoyable, fights where amazing, soundtrack was great, just a well-made hero movie where you can see superhumans dish out in fight!And considering the quality of the MCU we have received recently, I would definitely recommend this one to avid super hero fans!","

"georgewilliamnoble","25 October 2022","Since around late 2019, I have boycotted all superhero movies all that noise all that endless repetitive fighting that achieves little. However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie.","

"Batsy1501","19 October 2022","I think the movie was fine. Actually, it was pretty messy in a lot of ways. The villain was quite lacking in depth, and the pacing was too fast, making some scenes quite chaotic. The characters' development was okay for Black Adam and the JSA, but the boy that has a pretty large amount of screentime couldn't make me care about him, and I couldn't even remember his name. But just for the sound and visual aspects, Black Adam was completely worth enjoying; it was a visual and aural feast. The CGI battles were pretty insane, but also overwhelming sometimes. Overall, a 7 for me. Although Superman's appearance was fantastic, I think killing off Kent Nelson was a bad choice because he was definitely the highlight of the JSA team.","

"MrDHWong","20 October 2022","""Black Adam"" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019's ""Shazam!"". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam's rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character's sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical ""with great power comes great responsibility"" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.I have to admit it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he's going to pick and choose.To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there's extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It's just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.As the film is a spin-off from ""Shazam!"", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there's also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn't always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.It seems long overdue that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It's great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn't consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That's not to say he's always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate's comic debut predates Strange's creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn't have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there's any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like ""Black Adam"" doesn't really offer anything better or worse than what we've already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from ""Shazam!"", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.I rate it 7.5/10.","

"ACollegeStudent","16 March 2023","Rating: 4.0Interesting ideas decent effects but poor narrative execution. Finally a ""hero"" who doesn't care about killing people and has a good reason for his mindset his son a true hero died to save him making him feel unworthy of the legend that precipitated as he continues through his path of anger and mourning. The inversion of the motif life is the only path to death being used as the literal way the antagonist gains his powers was clever and the presentation was decent for the most part. The problem is the weak side characters: Adrianna is one-dimensional (only about her son), her son is a MacGuffin in the second half, atom smasher is bland comedy relief etc. There were nonsensical action scenes ex: Black Adam fighting guards with a literal tube down his throat when the guards can just shoot him. Black Adam going to save Adrianna's son then abandoning him at his house to fight enemies when he literally could've just taken him when he found him preventing his kidnapping. Also adam drowning then somehow rising to the surface so he could say shazam. And preachy dialogue: all of Adrianna's monologues about teamwork and oppression were cringe and forced. Same with her son. It just felt like fanfiction in areas from the action to the dialogue to the worldbuilding (eternium? Seriously?).","

"fluffchop","23 February 2023","You would think a movie like this might be good. I mean you expect a certain level of movie if it's a Marvel film right? So why do DC films fall so short? It's the lack of humor in the dialog. There's no witty one liners to amuse you as the action plays out. It takes 43 minutes until there is a superhero fight which is very boring. They take all this time to get to the point. Then it takes off into endlessly pointless fights for an hour plus. I just found the movie really tedious to sit through. These movies are made to be very basic. They want to appeal to a wide audience. They're basically expensive trash that is marketed hard. This movie is very bad.","

"subxerogravity","22 October 2022","Man! How long have I've been waiting to see this movie? I feel like The Rock has been talking about wanting to play the character since 2006. I always wondered why Black Adam? Not just an obscure Comic book character amongst DC's finest but why not just play his best rival SHAZAM and truly be a black superhero?I have to say, I'm so happy he picked Black Adam. Mostly because Dwayne Johnson playing a ""Villain"" met that superheroes would have to try to stop him, and they made the decision to...extend the DC Extended Universe with heroes that have not grace the silver screen yet.Aldis Hodge playing a cross between Batman and Black Panther with his version of Hawkman. The special effects to bring Atom Smasher to life were amazing, now I know who Cyclone is (I wonder if she's an actual black woman in the comic), and Pierce Brosnan, who could have been my generation's Batman, is playing Dr. Faith. Forming together to become the Justice Society and me hoping this will not be the last I see of them.Black Adam was good it was really good, absolutely worth the time and effort. The DC Extended universe has made some questionable movies, but this is not one of them. This was Aquaman, Wonder Woman good. This was SHAZAM good, and that's hope that battle with Black Adam is coming up!Excellent!!","

"PaperCoffins","19 October 2022","Just an average superhero movie with a 2005 vibe which was odd but let me tell you . Dr.fate is so fricken cool , best choice d.c had . They should've called it black rock because all you see is Dwayne roided up acting like Dwayne . Action is non stop pretty much so it doesn't fail on that part . Story is kinda meh , typical dc writing . Atom , well there's going to be a lot of comparisons to Deadpool per say . It's a fun popcorn movie check it out, expecially for the casuals who don't know much about black Adam . I think the comic nerds might not like a lot of it but that's okay . This movie is not for everyone but if you're looking for a good time , this movie definitely hits that spot.","

"Top_Dawg_Critic","4 November 2022","I will admit I had my doubts casting Johnson, but he nailed it so well, I actually wanted more of him. He needed more dialogue, and less cheesy attempts at humor from everyone else. The story conceptually was well played out, but none of the three (inexperienced superhero) writers had the creativity to elevate the story past the predicable, muddled, cliched antics, and attempts at humor - which was hit and miss. I laughed out loud here and there, but cringed and groaned at some of the infantile humor and dialogue. The other issue was director Jaume Collet-Serra's constant slow-mo shots; some I could understand were needed, but others were just too much and felt amateurish. The convoluted exposition, overblown CGI and overbearing score didn't do the film any justice either. This film could've been great in the hands of better filmmakers. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it more than expected, and I feel the critics went too hard on this one. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.","

"roanwormhoudt","19 October 2022","Black Adam is the latest film in the DCEU, and boy, it packs a punch. Explosions, flying superheroes, magic, lightning and beautiful armour follows the Justice Society, and of course Black Adam.The film centers around a god-like ancient human being who was gifted his powers in a time of darkness and enslavement. After being defeated and unseen for over a 5000 years, he returns, his goal being unknown. With the powers he has a group of superheroes, the Justice Society, deems him to be a threat, and performs an attempt to lock him up, unknown of the real danger.It is better than people say. Although at first glance it seems to be a film simply made for the action and explosions, it does have a story, strong dialogues and character development. The visual effects are astonishing in every single way, and people who have watched Avengers: Endgame will love the visuals in this film.My personal rating? A 10/10. My rating based on realism, plot and other factors? An 8 or a 9/10. If I'm going to be honest, the worst thing about this film was some unrealism like characters being able to survive a lot more than possible, and some being quite dumb in terms of their actions.As for my conclusion: Black Adam is a great, visually wonderful film with lots of action violence and lovable characters. Watch it in the cinema for a lifetime experience.","

"DarthWalker-34381","29 December 2022","I wanted Black Adam to be good. I really did. It was described by the Rock as ""Superman who kills the bad guys"". So, when it came to HBO Max, I couldn't wait to see it.Well, the only thing that was good about this movie was the cool action sequences, state of the art CGI and a big-budget ending.Beyond that, Black Adam was just plain bad....poorly written, full of stale one-liners and sloppy direction. And the acting...well, that wasn't great, either, but that's about what you would expect with such bad material. Dwayne Johnson, who normally delivers a charismatic performance with natural comedic timing, might have been going for a dark brooding dark knight like character but instead came off as mostly wooden and boring. Definitely the worst DC movie since Green Lantern. A huge disappointment.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","19 October 2022","After being trapped for nearly 5000 years, Adam(Johnson, strangely dialing his famous charisma down to zero for most of his screen time, and all in the present day) is released and clashes with the Justice Society of America over whether or not it is ok to use lethal force when fighting oppressors.This feels like multiple movies awkwardly glued together. The opening could easily have been extended into feature length, but they didn't want to spend that long in ancient times, so instead it is a massive(necessary, yes, still, could have been trimmed down) infodump. At times this is very gritty and dark. Then others, it is franchise friendly: quippy, breezy, let's bring in some young heroes that can keep appearing for years to come. Remind me, where are the JL in all of this? Casting couch?The reason that the titular character of this did not appear in the first Shazam movie(and it looks very unlikely he will be in the second one, either, except maybe as a sequel-baity mid or post credits scene) was said to be so they could have enough time to properly explore his character, however, it would have made more sense for this to feature Billy Batson or Superman instead of the JSA.The action is fun. Occasionally, it does forget that it is essentially nothing other than meaningless flash, except for when human beings who are not invulnerable, do not have immense superpowers, are put in danger: those fighting against their occupiers, such as Adrianna(Shahi, empathetic, strong) and her son Amon(Sabongui, passionate).This features some brutal violence. I recommend this to fans of the characters and of bombastic blockbusters. 7/10.","

"AfricanBro","21 October 2022","Admittedly far from impressive, doesn't reinvent the wheel and writing wasn't so great, but I loved it still. My feelings kept changing before it's release, compared to the days I was excited for it, it didn't deliver as much, but if compared to the days I was scared it was gonna flop then Black Adam was actually way better than my expectations.The first scenes of the movie are great, sorta reminds me of mythical movies like clash of the titans or Hercules in which Dwayne Johnson featured in too. Not many movies like that being made, we went from gladiator movies to Greek god movies, somewhere in between had Egyptian mummies and now we're in a superhero phase. Still think superhero movies are awesome fun, even better when done right but I loved gods and mythical movies, and this puts them both together.It has an almost dark ambience to it but is still visually stunning with Cyclone and Atom smasher giving it a more prismatic feel. They also had a little side plot going that actually didn't get anywhere. Compared to other recent movies, I love that Black Adam's origin was handled in a God Butcher-esque way, it was dark enough to still keep it dark while still keeping a pg13 rating which I thought should've been higher before release.It also blends Black Adam's Bronze Age origins and magic with future tech. If you're more of a fan of the cinematic universes and don't really read the comics, the movie does it's best to give you a background introduction, but because of this the first part of the movie feels rushed because it's a lot to condense into the start. Don't really read the comics so I don't know if they did Black Adam's character justice for the comic fans.Adams intro in the movie so good, and his main adversary's was even better later on, actually devilish. I love how when DC super-powers someone, they really go for it and people really hated it with Henry Cavil's Superman. I love the idea of them potentially getting into a brawl in the future.Action is superb once it starts, delivers on expectations although the movie almost leans a lot on it's action. I also recommend avoiding spoilers and trailers as I did. Loved how Black Adam's sternness is written to some comedic effect at times, I often say Hollywood shouldn't try making every new superhero movie into a joke show and they kept it in a low here.Dwayne Johnson was great and did his character justice, so did Pierce Brosnan as Dr fate, I think Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell suffered from being underwritten side characters due to so much plot and other characters the movie had to fit in, so they didn't get as much time to shine. If there was an award for most cameos in the same movie... I also feel like black Adam was written perfectly but at the end started making mannerisms that broke from his character, like the smirking and smiles.The actual problems I had with the movie were once the premise is revealed the story progresses generically, so you can pretty much figure out where the story is going. It's pretty formulaic and the story narration wasn't something to behold. For that reason, as much as I still love it, it's not as good as it could've been, it does deliver on shifting the power dynamics in the dceu though. And with all the great action and cast coupled with decent story, it's still a fun watch. Secondly, something I rarely say, it could've been better if it was longer to let the story develop and add depth; because it has the makings of a great movie and really finds it's footing in the third act but then blitzes quickly through it to the end.And it promises a lot for the future, I hope future DC movies are more coherent like what MCU does by making their movies relate, not just having heroes cameoing in other heroes movies then bunching them all together. This could be a great start to a phase in the DC universe, could argue it started with Shazam but you get it.It's imperfect and has wiggle room for improvement but I love it and would recommend seeing it on the big screen. Deadpool has been my favorite antihero for a long time and is a whole different character but I think black Adam's taking that spot now. I loved the movie for Black Adam's character himself.","

"ronaldfury","19 October 2022","Just finished watching black adam. Cgi is so good and visual effects are flawless. Fights scenes are brutal and fun to watch. Action packed from start to finish. Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal and the justice society of America makes it more fun and interesting(except cyclone). Hawkman,Black Adam are the badass in this film. Dwayne Johnson is really born to play this character and watch out for the mid credit scene!.This is the movie for a great momentum for the future of DC universe.At the negative side, villain is not intimidating and storyline is repetitive and there some cheesy scenes but overall this movie is a blast.So excited for the future of dceu. 7.5/10.","

"allen_pagent","24 November 2022","Far too many action movies are released that follow the same theme: two minutes of insipid dialog followed by 15 minutes of CGI that we've seen many times before, then repeat the whole thing all over again. The art of telling a great story is quickly heading toward extinction. Black Adam is a perfect example. The first task in character development. Why should we care about this person? None of the characters in this movie give you a reason to care about them. Even the villains are empty. No pressing reason to hate them. As I watched the move I was wondering why The Rock signed on. I mean aside from the obvious paycheck, the only challenge was perhaps working on some facial expressions. I hope Hollywood gives this character a quick death and doesn't pursue a sequel.","

"unsure-1","22 October 2022","There is little originality in this. No surprises. A few cringe moments. In other words, a typical Rock vehicle. Super-jarring to see any other parts of the universe stitched in as if they're supposed to fit (they don't). New characters introduced like we're supposed to know and love them already. The same Snyder-esque template (endless slow mo, dirty/dark palette). Dr. Fate copies literally every move from Dr. Strange. Hawkman annoying as hell with his bland brand of ""leadership"". And the villain, oh the villain...It's like they used one of the new AI tools to auto-generate everything in this movie. It's as entertaining as masturbation. If that's your thing, cool.","

"IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews","16 November 2022","Honestly, large parts of BLACK ADAM seem like they are cinematics from a hypothetical INJUSTICE game. Rubbery, bad CGI in fights with some cool moments. And it's all fine - until you realize that you don't have a controller in your hands.BLACK ADAM tries to be a darker anti-hero story, but it only succeeds in displaying lots of money being burnt on screen. A cheesy script with cheesy direction and cheesy acting and a very bad score - desperately trying to get your attention with cheesy CGI.Now, there's some nice and cool moments in this, but unfortunately, they don't make up for the horribly bad moments. Just think about an ancient culture, maybe even the oldest one on this planet - and they had some guy with a goofy lightning logo on his chest as their ""champion"". Right.Add a very generic score with insufferable ""beats"", and you get a cheese show deluxe.If anything, the fight between this strangely generic ""Hawkman"" and Black Adam in the kid's room was pretty fun, plus some shots and maybe even some lines in between, but as a whole, this is pretty much a mess from beginning to end - a convoluted two hours that won't really satisfy you. Too many bad lines, bad moments, bad plot points, bad characters and bad visuals that will spoil the fun. The concept is intriguing, though, and I would have loved to see a better script turned into reality by a way better director. Oh well.","

"danielwilianto","19 November 2022","This movie shows that DC should really stop making movies. It's hilariously bad on many level. Also they shouldn't have casted Dwayne Johnson. That guy is obviously still Dwayne no matter what role he is in.Why would Black Adam throw jokes such as, ""I waited for you before dropping those bad guys"" or ""The man in black said Hi?"" This guy was supposed to living a hellish live of a slave his whole life. And it should still feel like yesterday that he lost his child and wife. Why would he listen to a dumb suggestion made by a teenager?Also a fat man with leg problem and a skinny mom can beat up a lot of skeleton soldiers from hell? A squad of soldiers can take all of them even easier then. How come the world is in crisis?The main demon is admittedly stronger, but a punch from Superman will send him back to hell in an instant. Also, why did the whole world become nervous from this incident? Did they forget the existence of Justice League? Oh wait, why did our old magician contact and free Dwayne John instead of contacting Superman?Bad bad movie.","

"stevendbeard","22 October 2022","I saw Black Adam, starring Dwayne Johnson-Young Rock_tv, Baywatch_2017; Aldis Hodge-What Men Want, Leverage_tv; Sarah Shahi-Person of Interest_tv, Alias_tv and Pierce Brosnan-The Son_tv, the Mamma Mia! Movies.This is a comic book movie based on the books created by C. C. Beck. Black Adam started out as a villain for Captain Marvel-now known as Shazam because of Marvel's legal rights-but is now more of an anti hero, even becoming a member of the JLA in the comics. Anyway, Dwayne plays Teth_Adam, a slave some 5,000 years ago that gained powers similar to Captain Marvel/Shazam by Egyptian Gods by saying the magic word, Shazam. He is entombed after a fight against a villainous King and then released in the present by Sarah, a native of Kahndaq where Dwayne calls home. Sarah persuades Dwayne to help rid Kahndaq of Intergang, a criminal element that is taking over their country and notice of Dwayne's activities reach the USA. The JSA-Justice Society of America, an early version of the JLA-are called in to subdue Dwayne. Good luck with that. Pierce is Dr Fate and Aldis is Hawkman and they bring a couple of trainees, Cyclone and Atomsmasher. There is a nice cameo for Atomsmasher's father. The fights are pretty good and Dwayne, who was made for this role, really doesn't like to take prisoners. There is a scene just after the end credits start but nothing at the very end.It's rated PG-13 for strong violence, intense action and some language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.I really liked this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

"benjaminskylerhill","21 October 2022","Director Juame Collet-Serra's extensive experience helming thriller films is quite evident here; the action-while not particularly distinctive-is more than sufficiently hard-hitting, gleefully destructive, and thrilling to keep the film from ever becoming dull.That's quite the achievement, because on paper Black Adam is a largely dull exercise. It's entirely derivative of other, better superhero films, and is without an ounce of any sense of originality in what it delivers to this corpse of a genre.The film has a villain who is never really introduced until the final act and is laughably cartoonish. He's a punching bag for the characters to have something to fight at the end of the movie.The ordinary mortal characters are just as lifeless. Most of the people in this movie aren't actual living, breathing human beings, but plot devices.That being said, The Rock's titular character of Black Adam is actually handled surprisingly well. His background of tragedy is thoroughly explored (even though it's through clunky narration exposition dumps), and does undergo tangible internal change over the course of the story.Adam's change in self-image has moderately thought-provoking implications as he comes to realise that his past failures don't determine currency worthiness.This is one of only two bright spots in the writing, along with watching Adam and Hawkman clash in their worldviews/opinions of justice.I really do wish that these bright spots made up more of the movie. Because the entire plot is constructed solely of story beats and objects and antagonists who have not only been seen before, but have been seen before so often-and exactly in this way-that they've been beaten more than any deceased horse.Consequently, it's a sometimes charming, largely competent exercise in rote rehash.","

There is something about an ancient crown, but other than that, you got me. Dwayne is just fine as as an ""action"" hero and there is lots going on. Explosions and stuff. But nothing makes any sense and the film commits the greatest crime-its boring. It keeps repeating the same thing over and over. You mind goes numb watching people being thrown hither and yon. It actually starts out pretty good, but once the rock appears it seems to lose its way. I'm sure it will be a big success, but not because its worth seeing. Sorry.","

I mean, I was expecting a fun movie that wasn't strong, had great effects, and had good / ok acting. The movie was such a movie. I think the effects were very good. Acting was ok. The Rock was a perfect fit for the role. Frankly, I found the script weak. So obviously there were some good lines and ideas in the movie, but they couldn't fill it. It could have been a good story, a questioning movie, but it didn't. The ending of the movie was very predictable and it ended exactly as I expected. After credit was good. The slow-montion action scenes were good in the beginning, but then they became too repetitive. In general, I liked it, but also did not like it. But i don't think this movie is bad.","

But it's a sorry excuse if trying to make a funny and ""dark"" marvel movie. The plot is so illogical. The black Adam plot is good and they've could have done it with that alone. But they had to put in 4 ridiculous heroes that comes in and tries to save the day and that's an opportunity to make a cheap political correct point: ""you never cared about this country but now that we have our own hero you want to help and regulate us""Stupid...They spend the whole movie building black Adam as a charachter that is to strong for his own good and after destroying a whole city that still cheers for Adam... he all of a sudden realizes that his to dangerous and gives up his powers to be closed in to a maximum security facility deep under the Arctic Ocean to be stored in cryo for all eternity and it feels like the movie is ending and we could get a prequel to a movie where NOTHING happened. But no... the bad guy lives and looks now like hellboy and now wants to destroy the whole city where he wanted to be king... look and behold, black Adam rises from his cryo as a mere human and with bare hands he kicks the shenanigan out of 6 elite guards (who has 6 guards in a maximum security facility?!?!) and then swims out to almost die, daydream a bit while the devil himself kicks the shenanigans out of our other useless heroes... then says Shazam and then is in game again.Meanwhile the little boy who taught our main charachter all about morality and chivalry in under 8 hours now decides to take it in his own hands to gather the city and unite it against their enemy of living dead soldiers by standing on a stone and in a pathetic way say: come on, this is what we've been waiting for"" the citizens then realize ""yes this is what we've been waiting for! To fight a living dead hord with our bare hands, yes! Let's do it!"" So led by a 15 year old boy who in the next scen has taken the time to find a skateboard to carry him victoriously into the next scene, we se old ladies and regular citizens now beat the butt out of the living dead summoned from hell...I was in agony... I'm so sorry they did this to you Dwayne... you deserved better.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","1 August 2023","Black Adam is freed from his Earthly tomb after 5000 years, full of anger and rage, Earth isn't perhaps quite ready for Adam's presence, nor are the local Superheroes.I'm basing my review after a second viewing. I originally saw it in the cinema upon its release, it was met with a plethora of groans and sighs, second time round, I watched with some close friends, some real Marvel addicts, all of whom didn't rate it.First time round, I honestly thought it was a spoof, I thought it was sending up Marvel's early years, how sad to release this was no spoof.The main issue for me, the absolute absence of any plot, there just isn't any significant, basic storyline, it's just a sequence of messy, random events.There's an old saying, called a mug's eyeful, basically meaning that there's so much going on in front of you, too much, and that is very much the case here, this is a CGI monstrosity, way too many effects. This however is a mug's brainful, the music is overpowering, the effects are too relentless, it aimlessly crashes from one scene to the next.If I was forced to highlight a positive, I would say that Dwayne Johnson was way too good for the abysmal script he was working with, he adds a sincerity and gravitas that the film almost doesn't deserve, what a waste of his talents.If your only interest is CGI special effects, you'll find something here, otherwise, you'll be left totally unimpressed.Shockingly bad.4/10.","

Maybe there are people who were, but as for myself and the people I know, Black Adam was just yet another superhero movie in an unending line of superhero movies; all the same with nothing new or fresh to offer. But still, as is custom, I had to go check this movie out because Sri Lanka's roster of theater releases aren't that great, so I'll take whatever comes.Black Adam ended up being sometimes funny, a little more than sometimes cringe, and extremely mid. It's a movie with the most generic stakes ever, and with nothing new to add to a genre that has been the same for the past few years. The only aspect I personally enjoyed in the movie was Pierce Brosnan, and sometimes The Rock, but everything else fell flat. Especially whatever the writers tried to do with the Amon character. Things couldn't have been more generic than that.Overall, is it a bad movie? Far from it. Is it good? NO. Should you watch it? Well, you wouldn't be missing anything if you didn't.","

"Jithindurden","20 October 2022","Amid all the negative reviews and expectations of a The Rock movie, this was precisely what I expected. A simple entertaining film if you're able to see past some of its obvious faults. The action really felt like it was trying to be Zack Snyder lite, which partially works because it only tries to be lite in using that style even though the movie itself is action-packed. The characters are very forgettable although the performances of Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge and the rest of the Justice Society members gives some life to it. The music was very underwhelming for me especially because it tries to elevate scenes by becoming loud and noticeable without making any impact.Black Adam is supposed to be an antihero but with a star like The Rock, he is only a reluctant hero who doesn't mind killing. Overall just a watchable film if you're a fan of the superhero genre.","

"jvg37","24 October 2022","Having Saw Black Adam 2 days ago, I can say that I enjoyed it immensely. The Rock played it straight instead of with his recently usual cartoonishness.This isn't the same, goofy Dwayne Johnson from ""Jumanji"" or ""Jungle Cruise"" as he plays it much darker and with seriousness. While not a technical masterpiece, ""Black Adam"" delivers where it counts the most - in terms of pure enjoyment! It is a thrilling popcorn flick through and through and should go down as one of the Rock's better films...The supporting cast was good, though they were a bit cookie-cutter and under developed as a whole. Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman could have used a bit more a background story as it was difficult to invest any emotion for them. It was as though they just appeared and we were just supposed to know their backstory. Aside from that, and the choppiness of the first 20 mins, it was an all out good watch...","

"simonwoodwrites","4 January 2023","Sadly, this is a trainwreck of a movie that set itself up for failure. The story is where most of this goes wrong. It needed a lot of streamlining and simplification. There is so much detail trying to be crammed in here that it is cluttered but at the same time, vague. A few issues I had. Who was the bad guy and what was Black Adam's objective? There are these mercenaries that run the country and for the longest time we don't who is running it and no one seems to be interested in getting rid of them by the end. There is so much backstory and it keeps being revised throughout the movie. The hero vs villain dynamic is a mess. Black Adam seems to be against everyone--Justice Society, the mercs and anyone in his way. So the story doesn't have any direction or focus. There's a problem with the characters. The Justice Society is such a poor relation to the Justice League and Suicide Squad why bother. Their abilities did nothing. Black Adam himself, yes, he's antihero but his behavior was baffling. This guy did more damage to his country and its infrastructure than anyone that it's baffling why they were cheering for him. Oh, and stop floating and busting through walls. The tone is off. It bounces from R-rated to wanting to play to kids with a kid sidekick. Sadly, it's another superhero movie CGI overload. It never looks good compared to actual locations and practical effects. Finally, like spies in spy movies, Superheroes shouldn't talk about themselves as heroes.I could keep going on about the issues with this movie but I don't have the energy. Overall, is it the worst superhero movie ever made, no. Is it's clumsiest ever conceived? Yep.","

Those 2 were more like Accessories to the Main 3 which were Black Adam, Hawkman And Doctor Fate. So Those 2 Fulfilled their Roles.1. Firstly the Movie is So Much Fun.2. All of the Battle Scenes are Really Pinging the Top of the Meter Visually and Are Stunning on the Eye. I Love Stunning Energy Within the Slow Motion, the Choreography and Impact Sounds in the Battles.3. The Rock Produces a Strong Performance as Black Adam.4. Pierce Brosnan has a Couple of Really Standout Beautiful Moments in the Movie.5. The Dynamic between the Justice Society, Black Adam, Sarah Shahi and the young Boy was Weak at First but then as time went on, the Chemistry grew and grew and I liked it.6. I loved watching Hawkman and Black Adam go back and Forth about Various Things.7. I liked the Backstory and History of Kahndaq. Also, the Real Reason of How the Rock Became Black Adam was a Nice Touch.8. Some of The Comedy Landed Well.The thing I Did not Like -1. What the hell was that ""Undead Army"" all about? It was Pointless and The Zombies were Weak as HellOverall, This Is One Of DC's Best To Date. Only Time will Tell Just How Good it Was.","

"fgjzxbkqh","30 December 2022","Two stars are for costumes and visual effects. To highlight some positive aspects first.The story is super boring. You do not know who you shall rooting for and it is mainly fighting. Maybe a comic fan might like it, but for me it is just flat and disappointing.The characters are not shaped well. The movie does not trigger any emotions and is lacking Humor. The connection between the past story and the current events has very small room so that it was not enough to get torn into it.One of the few movies I was waiting for to end and finally leave the cinema. If you do not care about a story, but fighting scenes it may be for you.","

"chuckinparis","7 November 2022","This is a really poor movie. Boring script and lame superheroes. It seemed like every scene was the same fight sequences repeated over and over. After 30 minutes I was looking at my watch to see how much longer this movie had left. I don't know how it's getting good ratings on this site by viewers. I am no film critic but it's easy to rate this thing pretty low. I am Not sure what happened with this movie but the end result is a costly train wreck. My suggestion to you is don't pay to see it in the theater. Wait until it's on cable so you can snooze through it in the comfort of your living room for free.","

"Ben-Mood","3 February 2023","I don't like crapping all over art pieces. And movies are a form of art. But nowadays movie producers think that a massive budget is enough. Imagine what someone with a real vision could've done even with 1/10th of the budget ""black adam"" had. The movie started ok, I wanted to see more. But after the first fight scene, the movie turned into one big explosion. It was repetitive, shallow, and extremely boring. Obviously, a normal person can't produce such a movie. The cgi itself costs a fortune. But I just think to myself what I would've done with such a massive budget. How can a fast pace movie without a plot be so successful?.. No idea..","

"jessegehrig","14 February 2023","This is a review for the the Fire Emblem game, Fire Emblem Engage! Also this is a display of contempt for the movie I'm supposed to be reviewing. So the new Fire Emblem is pretty good. I don't think Fire Emblem Engage is better than Fire Emblem Three Houses, but that said I've been playing Fire Emblem Engage every day since it's release on January 20th. What I like about Fire Emblem games is the game play- I move all of my guys and the computer does nothing, then when my turn is over the computer moves all of its guys and I can do nothing. Some people might not like that aspect of powerlessness, cause you just have to wait and you can't do anything about what's happening, but I really appreciate the waiting because it gives me a chance to use the bathroom or like get something out of the fridge.","

Cyclone, Fate and Atom Smasher have a plan, to curtail Teth-Adam's rampage with Hawkman, temper all of his frustrations, to protect the world of nations, they just need to get his lips to say 'shazam'. Meanwhile Ishmael seeks to get the Crown of Sabbac, there's a role he fancies having, a big stab at, and there are those deep down below, quite keen that he has a go, and only one can take him on, our man in black.A more than satisfying two hours of hero, antihero, baddie brilliance.","

Literally poor direction , most of place felt rushed , clumsy and incomplete . Action sequence was topnotch , with good choreography and marvelous visuals . Humor worked well in few places . More than Black Adam we can only see Dwayne Johnson . Comparing to others Doctor Fate was pretty impressive . Antagonist didn't create much impact . Cast done their job well .

"PedroPires90","23 October 2022","In a year where the genre is more saturated than ever, Black Adam just isn't the worst because there was Morbius.The character shows potential - in fact, the scenes in the past were the most interesting; The Rock has what it takes to be Black Adam; there are some funny moments and high-level visual effects...However, all this is undermined by a bad plot, a terrible script, little use of characters that should be more important, and excessive slow motion every 20 seconds to the point of making anyone's head hurt.I also didn't love all the attempts to make this something similar to what MCU is in terms of the universe...","

However when the movie starts its supposedly 5000 years later... but this modern world is unrecognizable except for the Superman & Batman iconography, which isn't subtle at all.The humour is forced and delivered deadpan, just as most of the dialog. The cast are either bored or receiving poor direction and the fight scenes are akin to a Tom & Jerry cartoon.The CGI is great though, which is its only saving grace!","

"pap-05900","19 October 2022","Black Adam is everything anyone hoped it was really. Its a fun and thrilling action packed superhero movie.Dwyane Jhonson plays a somewhat stoic antihero and is elevated by his cast mainly the actors for Hawkman and Dr Fate who are the standout in this movie. Though i would have liked to seen more of Atom Smasher and Cyclone because theyre barely in the movie. The mythos of Black Adam is something most people will find interestig as well. And the film does a good job of introducing new characters and places and overall expanding the DCEU.So did the heiracrchy in DC universe change? Well kinda. This film may be fun and pretty violent at times. And I can see it doing really well in the box office. The critics are most probably not gonna like this movie as it is a bit messy at times and the stoic performance by the ROCK may not be the cup of tea for everyone. But for an average joe who doesnt keep up with their daily cup of critical pretentiousness, and just wants to spend some time watching badass superheroes being badass. This is the film for you.Its no 'Batman Begins' but it never wants to be. Fun but flawed is the best description i can give it. I really enjoyed it. And most people will certainly do aswell.And also, stay for the post credits. You wont be disappointed.","

This film was supposed to be a companion piece to Shazzam, which in my view was a boring kid's movie.Black Adam doesnt know what it wants to be. Is it a super hero movie? An anti-hero movie? Or is it an Indiana Jones movie?In any case it's absurdly derivitive. Filled with the same types of characters as the Indiana flicks, but not as good. Further the CGI is horrible for a big budget movie and some ""human"" characters actually look like video game CGI renderings.They also try to insert those pop mucical interludes like Marvel movies, but fail miserably. In fact there are quite a few unintentional laffs in there because it's so cheesy.The Rock should stick to Jumangi sequels At least those are entertaining.Another huge disappointment from the DC universe.PS I dont even understand why this character was in the comics in the first place. How is he different from Superman?","

"ruelshepperd","22 October 2022","The efforts of the DCEU have ranged from great to downright terrible. For every Wonder Woman we get a Justice League and so on. This inconsistency in tone, style and quality has left the DCEU aimless in its path. Black Adam seeks to send the DCEU in a new direction. Does it succeed... No, but it's fine if you turn your brain off.This movie feels like action sequence after action sequence, some of them serviceable, the rest being CGI messes. This movie never stops to take a breath or build character. It is non-stop action leaving you with little care for the characters. There is no real plot to speak of and what there is hangs on a cliched Mcguffin. This film is as simple and brain dead as they come but it is at least entertaining.The characters are all forgettable. Dwayne Johnson broods his way through the film as Black Adam. His character is sort of a fish out of water with some moral greyness and by the end he becomes a better person but otherwise he does not emote or have any true emotional depth that makes me connect with him. The only character who is remotely memorable is Dr Fate played by Pierce Brosnan. He gives a solid performance and there is a cool idea with him being able to see the future and trying to prevent others dying if it means sacrificing himself. Otherwise, the rest of the characters are basic and one note and the antagonist is possibly one of the worst in any superhero film.Overall, Black Adam does offer non-stop mindless action though that action varies heavily in quality and is lacking any form of pretentiousness and heavy-handed messages but it's characters and plot are almost non-existent and it's not a film that will stick with you once you've seen it. It will fly out of your mind faster than Black Adam himself.","

"breneff","19 October 2022","I'm not gonna lie, I never understood why we needed a Black Adam movie. He's an antihero who used to be a Shazam villain. It would make more sense to have him be a villain in the Shazam sequel and then set up his individual film. I don't know why we are trying to have him be the new face of DC. It's also strange that the actor Dwayne Johnson is so obsessed with him being more powerful than Superman. It's cool that the Rock is passionate about this character but after what I just saw it's almost if the only reason why he was passionate about it is because of how powerful and edgy he is in the fact that he's better than everyone else. Also... Black Adam supposed to be Egyptian. The rock is not Egyptian, he doesn't even have Egyptian accent or is even able to speak Egyptian. It bothers me so much and nobody talks about it. They barely care about his backstory at all or his personality. In fact I would say he has zero personality in this movie because all he is is stoic, boring, and power-hungry. I love the rock and the majority of his films but this does kind of feel like a power fantasy he wrote especially due to the fact the guy during the movie barely takes a beating and just rails through all of his adversaries consistently. It's kind of hard to get invested into a character that is basically invincible. Superman is interesting because he has weaknesses and other people that are stronger than him. He's also a humble person and he has a lot going for him personality wise because of his upbringing. There's nothing here other than ""I'm not a hero, and I kill, and I'm super powerful, and nobody can beat me"". That's it that's the entire motive of this guy. It is cool to see a brooding ultraviolent superhero who kills without mercy. But you need to give the character inner turmoil and something to like about him in order for people to really care about him. Then the movie gets into the justice society which is where the movie starts to go downhill even more. These are characters that have never been introduced before and the film seems to care more about powers than it does about the characters origins. Which in all honesty is kind of the main theme of the movie. It just cares about powers. It doesn't care about anything else. Very disappointed.","

Adding some ethnic flavor to his accent would've paid off mightily.Carrying echoes of Snyder but with the treatments and levity of the Wonder Woman and Aquaman entries to the DCEU, Black Adam hits the right notes and solidifies that the DCEU is alive and well.Unless you've been living under a rock, make sure to stick around for the post-credit scene.Solid 8/10.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","25 October 2022","Black Adam is a superhero movie's superhero movie: and it seems like critics and audiences (even though they're both one and the same most of the time) are becoming evermore divided on what one group thinks about the productions in question. Yes the film's cliched, yes the characters don't exactly have depth to them through most of the movie, yes the CGI evokes Star-Wars-Prequel-Trilogy-Ragdoll-Physics or 2000s-Ragdoll-Physics, but Dwayne Johnson is such an entertainingly stoic action-man that it's like he's playing an unironic parody of action movies that it just goes with the flow of its own self-aware sense of Hollywood-isms.Black Adam is an origin story, a team-up movie, a villain showcase, and somewhat confused in its fan-service like the LITERAL POSTERS of the Wonder Woman movie, Batman-comic-accurate-artwork, Superman merchandise, Injustice toys (from the video games), and the Suicide-Squad-style intro to our supporting characters makes you wonder... is DC Films self-aware of its success AND shortcomings in the past, and is just throwing everything into a blender with these shared-universe movies? If so: interesting choice. It doesn't work for 'serious cinema' necessarily, but it's a nice approach that can certainly be refined. Just... have the fourth-wall-breaking-fan-service make sense in the story; please?Anywho: Black Adam has FINALLY been released after years of false-starts, Tweets, and studio-reshuffling to make even seasoned studio executives perplexed, and 2022 has Black Adam... breaking away from Shazam entirely. The two were originally gonna be in the Shazam! Movie. Makes you wonder if it should've stayed that way? At least they're finally in cinema: and now they can breathe in sequels I suppose.This movie may not be what some of the fans are expecting, but the fan-service on display does work (when it makes sense) and the action can be a sight to behold, and the leading man himself knows how to rock the spandex look absolutely. The screenplay is a confused mess scared of the antihero theme making 'The Rock' look like a villain; so they sprinkle conflicted protagonist and boom, Black Adam's now a superhero. 3/5 stars.For all that doesn't work in the film, the stuff that does keeps it from becoming downright tedious thankfully. When it's action-heavy it's action-heavy. With the fan service it's going all the way when it can. Just don't expect the story to break your minds or something. It's fairly straightforward stuff: and maybe that's what is bothering the critics.","

"SnoopyStyle","18 November 2022","It's 2600 BCE in the advanced civilization of Kahndaq. Tyrannical King Ahk-Ton has enslaved the population to mine and build his Crown of Sabbac imbued with dark magical powers. A young slave boy is given the powers of Shazam by the Council of Wizards and he defeated the King. In the present day, Kahndaq is under the control of foreigners out to exploit its resources. Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) works to liberate the country. She finds the crown and unleashes Black Adam (Dwayne Johnson). Amanda Waller declares him a threat and sends the Justice Society. Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Dr. Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell) are the members.It must have been a big celebration when Dwayne declared that he wanted to play Black Adam. When a big box office draw wants to lead your franchise, you don't say no. It doesn't mean that he fits the role. The Rock is not Black Adam. The role needs someone darker filled with regret and vengeance. Dwayne may be able to stretch his acting range. He is unable here. The role seems to deaden his natural effervescent personality. He loses his onscreen charms. He can play the role, but there are other actors who could do it better. No matter who, the character still needs more development. The opening flashback story could be expanded. That would punctuate the shock later in the movie. Instead, a lot of story gets crushed under the overstuff CGI action and squeezing so many superheroes into this movie. It should be a Black Adam origin story and only his story. Despite all of this, I am still rooting for The Rock and his work in the DC universe.","

"A_Different_Drummer","6 November 2022","Cringe worthy. To review this film is to contemplate the really great film that could have been made for the same budget, perhaps in an alternate universe. Just about everyone in this production is miscast, most especially Johnson who now in his 50s could consider this franchise a retirement program. The script is an abomination, none of the jokes work, and the fact that most of the humor is based on killing people (or not) only deepens the cringe. It does however accomplish one impossible thing -- it makes most of the recent and experimental TV shows from the competing MCU look absolutely brilliant in comparison.

"eddie_baggins","3 November 2022","For a while here there's a sense that DC, on one of its few and far between occasions, has managed to deliver a feature film product worthy of its source material (and extensive budgets) with director Jaume Collet-Serra managing to start Black Adam in a fun and exciting fashion that seems to suggest audience goers were going to be treated to something a little unexpected, something just slightly amended from the usual playbook of initial superhero adventures but then all hope and excitement is extinguished by a teenage boy and his ever-present skateboard.More on that later.A much-hyped production that its leading man has been championing for the better part of the last few years, Black Adam presents DC with one of its greatest chances yet to bring one of its more complicated creations to screen and while his natural charisma (that you either love or hate) is mainly squashed in a role that brings to mind Arnie from Terminator 2, Dwayne Johnson fits the bill to be our anti-hero Teth Adam but despite some impressively staged early action scenes and a narrative that doesn't always play to the rules set out for large blockbuster origin stories such as this, Black Adam is unable to keep the foot on the gas as some questionable narrative decisions and character inclusions halt much of the films progress in being a silly but fun popcorn munching ride.There are times here when you forget you're watching a Black Adam film with Bodhi Sabongui and Sarah Shahi's Kahndaq natives Adrianna and Amon Tomaz joining Adam's journey as he awakens from a 5000 year slumber to all of a sudden be battling unknown forces and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman led Justice Society, with these two characters playing large roles in proceedings to an extent they become a genuine annoyance and by the time Amon is rallying local citizens in one of the most cringe-worthy battle cries committed to celluloid before leading a charge on his beloved skateboard you know that Black Adam has failed to hit the mark.These glaringly non-important characters and plot diversions do in some ways mask other problems that become more apparent as Black Adam's runtime wears on with Collet-Serra's insistence on including either a blasting musical score or Spotify 101 pump up songs in all of his abundant slow-mo action scenes or a collection of underdeveloped characters that includes the films main villain and Justice Society members Atom Smasher and Cyclone other reasons why the film fails to go on with its various moments of promise, with one almost wishing we were allowed more time to get to know Adam or even Pierce Brosnan's Dr. Fate/Kent Nelson, who steals many of the films best scenes with one hoping the veteran screen actor gets a chance to shine in a solo outing in the near future.To be fair to all involved, Black Adam is far from the worst DC movie to come our way but in regards to promise and potential verses the final outcome, this loud, colourful and soulless outing is equivalent to the likes of Man of Steel and Suicide Squad as features that seemed to be set to shine only for poor decisions and weak directive decisions hampering any chance they had of shining on the big stage.Final Say -Not without its moments, Black Adam is hampered by an increasingly painful plot-line and even worse supporting characters that take away from the films early signs that it is looking to do something a little different than the usual origin story run-through.2 1/2 skateboards out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"Drawmort","16 November 2022","There is probably nothing in this review that hasn't already been said before. The first film to reveal Black Adam to the world is not even close to the expectations nor the level of marketing raised by its producers and protagonist. Usually, excessive paraphernalia is the mask of a bad product and Black Adam confirms it.The whole show staged looks like a superhero movie from the early 2000's. Too much badly applied CGI, too empty a plot, too many catchphrases and heroic poses.The photography is horrible. I hated the lenses chosen for this film. There's only 1 shot where it's justifiable, and it's 1 second long. The visual effects are overdone, the colors are oversaturated, the color filters are a poor imitation of previous movies. This is just an accumulation of scenes that were meant to be spectacular, but don't land well, because it's all so pretentious. Overall, the action, humor, acting, and sound editing are mediocre.Recommendable? Only if you're a turn-of-the-century TV seller looking for a couple of eye-catching images to make your products stand out a bit.2022 closes as one of the worst years for superhero cinema.","

Boring and also we kept wondering what is this that we are watching.Wanted to leave the theater , still want to.Writing this during the film so that I don't fall asleep.We did leave right before the end. We could not stand it afterall.On a very serious note, it was such a lukewarm attempt at a making the film worthy if any attention. The references were all over. It seemed like the actors themselves were bored. Dialogues were weak. The story was even weaker.A climax never happened and the movie never got better.Nothing came together. Just a water effort. It could have been nice with what they were trying to imply with the occupation forces and the white savior complex but sadly very sad attempt.","

"bhernandez2216","22 October 2022","Black Adam is literally one of the best action movies ever made by the one and only The Rock himself: Dwayne Johnson! It was worth a wait!What I really loved about Black Adam is all the action and it was also brutal in so many badass scenes they delivered to the big screen!Dwayne Johnson is at he's best and he did a pretty good job playing Black Adam. It was his dream come true and he has accomplished that dream of playing an anti-hero of the movie. Hawkman tho was awesome including Doctor Fate!I'm gonna have to say this is one of my favorite Dwayne Johnson's superhero movie I've ever experienced my whole life for this movie. It was a BLAST! And I really had a lot of fun with this movie!Be sure to wait for the post credits, cause the post credit scene will blow you away and I do not wanna say anything about it. So.... LET'S GO BLACK ADAM!","

"rafaelreyesgutierrez","27 November 2022","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, however I was super disappointed with the senseless plot that goes nowhere, it's just a brute display of special effects and bad CGI that lasts for too long. And don't get me started on the cringe worthy dialogues.Btw, it's super obvious and sad to see DC studios trying to copying so unashamedly (and failing) several Marvel movies, In Black Adam you may recognize a mixture of X-Men, Deadpool, Dr Strange, SHIELD and Wakanda. Only that it is badly executed!In summary if you are into super hero movies my suggestion is that you stick with Marvel studios.","

"cruise01","22 October 2022","5 out of 5 stars.Black Adam is an awesome superhero film that is big, action packed, and it delivers a big blockbuster film. Dwayne Johnson who is producing and starring in the film has been dedicated to this project for years. Its finally out in the big screen and he takes the project and delivered it to his fans. They can expect a big blockbuster action film and delivering the anti hero DC character.The plot is good showing Adam (Dwayne Johnson) brought back in the present time when a group of mercenaries are after a crown which can resurrect evil. Adam takes justice into his own hands and is on the search for the crown with the help of Adrianna (Sarah Shahi). While the Justice Society lead by Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) is on the hunt to stop Adam from leaving a huge body count.The film is non stop action with one set piece to another. The action sequences are big and exciting. The visual effects are great. Dwayne Johnson delivers with the role. Along with Aldis Hodge, Noah Centineo, Quintessa Swindell, and Pierce Brosnan with there roles in the justice society. Sarah Shahi did great as well. Marwan Kenzari as the villain was also good.The film is exciting and it is one fun entry in the DC franchise with giving a fast paced direction which it may over shadow any development to any characters and story. It is one adrenaline fueled direction that will put the audiences into a wild action ride that makes you want to see it again.There is a mid credit scene that will have the audiences cheering for another film.","

"MiroslavKyuranov","19 October 2022","""The new era"" for the DCEU is here, but sadly, it's not quite the jump in quality the cinematic universe truly needed.The introduction of Black Adam is flawed as many of the previous DCEU movies have been, and there are no notable changes in direction that make it stick out in its own way. The movie fails to find a unique mark and doesn't really have anything interesting to say.If everything you want from a superhero movie is the action, you got it, also sometimes the CGI feels overused. Try to go any deeper than that, and there's not much else to be found.Best part of the movie must be Brosnan's Doctor Fate, but he can't carry the whole movie just by the look of his character. There needs to be a story...a good one, which is missing here.There's not much that can be said about the film's villain, Sabbac, without spoiling the film. However, even if spoilers weren't an issue, there's still basically nothing interesting to say about him.Even with all that said, given how big Dwayne Johnson is and how much power he seems to have over the franchise (and now the DCEU as well), fans should expect Black Adam to carry on in a big way going forward for better or for worse. New hierarchy they said? Yeah. No.","

"CarolineFR69","15 November 2022","I was so disappointed with this one, and the friend I saw it with thought the same. We went to see the movie because Dwayne Johnson is in it, obviously, but also because we like that kind of movie. And I feel like DC just doesn't know how to show grief. They failed in Batman vs Superman, and they fail with Black Adam. In the movie you have Teth Adam, seen as a hero by an enslaved population that is still enslaved today, fighting against the Justice Society, supposedly a superhero team, as well as fighting against the villain with the crown of Sabbac. Teth Adam is basically Deadpool without the comedy, he kills his (evil) opponents to save others, and that's the only reason why the Justice Society think of him as evil, while the whole population sees him as their saviour. If this was not already bad enough, said Justice Society is boring very fast, with the same slow motion shots, which are cool the first time you see them, but just don't work throughout the movie, and a team lead that is just not the hero he should be. The whole movie feels like a parody of a superhero movie, with Dwayne Johnson wasted as a hero, when he could have been perfect for the role with the right director. The redeeming grace is the Tomaz family that you follow throughout the movie, with the mother being truly good and wanting to save her people, and the kid believing in Teth Adam so much that he teaches him how to act in the modern world. The movie was saved in our eyes with the post credit scene, that showed hopefully a better next movie.","

"rh_0809","20 October 2022","Finally a movie gives the feeling that DC are making great movies again. First of all, it may not be comic accurate at all but Dwayne Johnson is the perfect casting for Black Adam. Also the Justice Society castings were great, although we did not get much to know about their backstories. Their past and their development may be one of the few things that was missing in the plot. But fortunately it did not disturb anything about the backstory and the development of Black Adam himself. Unlike the other DC movies, the darkness was adjusted better this time. Also the very little piece of comedy has found a place in the Movie. The surprise in the post credit scene was just awesome and hope giving for the next projects of DC. The film is recommended.","

The ending is predictable and predictable, I would have liked something different, but instead we had a film that repeats many other films of the past, without any originality. Everything already seen, everything already done, everything predictable, everything repetitive.","

"dmach-61247","21 October 2022","I am tired about this kind of movies! You sit in your chair, wait for a great story to develop and they nearly ALWAYS start with telling you a complete back story in itself in the first two minutes of film. WHY? Where is ""Show, don't tell!""? I am watching this to see it unfold and not get a backstory pushed into my brain in two minutes. After being flashed like this I do not care anymore about the rest of the film because I already know what awaits. Gone is the magic of an unfolding universe. Already did see it compressed into the first two minutes before... so the rest is just more of the same lame stuff! ""Black Magic"" makes also no sense to use in a Superhero movie which is based on Science-Fiction 90%. There is a reason magic is NOT a driving force in comics!Please Hollywood stop giving us this nerdlike movies and concentrate on telling good and big stories again without starting a movie with a compressed two minute movie in itself! Makes NO SENSE!","

"Animus","18 February 2023","Black Adam tries so hard to be an MCU movie that it's painful to watch at some points. The premise is set up in the opening narration buuuuuut don't put too much stock in it since the movie retcons that not once but TWICE within the film. The story is fairly generic and derivitive of the MCU movies, bad guy mercs on flying bikes (the Chitauri), magic minerals (Vibranium), supercharged weapons (stark tech), an out of touch hero (Thor) who doesn't understand the world, and so on. The only thing different is that instead of the Avengers we get Suicide Squad 2.5 with their own Dr Strange, Giant-man, Storm and Falcon knock offs who have no clue what 'teamwork means', not in the beginning, not in the middle and not really at the end either.If you like Dwayne Johnson being clueless and saying things that are funny because he is clueless, then this a movie you'll enjoy. If you like lots of special effects for no good reason, again - this is for you since many of the scenes and effects are gratuitous. If you want a coherent plot, interesting characters and events that make sense... go somewhere else.","

"michael-561-692892","9 December 2022","Did the fools of DC not learn a dang thing from the failure that was Justice League? This endless explosion followed by explosion with a demon with mutated voice is almost a copy cat of that horrible mess. About a hour into this you begin to wonder if this was written by teenaged boys. I feel terrible now that I have wasted so much of my time and money watching this. There's no redeeming this garbage pile. The scene with black Adam ripping the Satan dude in half was enough for me to forever give up on DC. I think I only watched up until the very end to see Superman one last time. Such a sad day.","

"kupukupumu","8 December 2022","First of all, I am not a fan of the Rock, but he is the perfect cast for Black Adam, especially when he sat on the throne. And, I had been anticipating this movie sonce the trailer showed additional cast of Justice Society members. The Hawkman, especially, but it turned into disappointment. First, why a black Carter, in a movie that already has so much diversity in the casts? Second, the Hawkman's character here felt more like Chickenman to me. Since when Hawkman, and Justice Society, work for Amanda???And, Justice Society were supposed to be in the WW2 era, not present day. Also, Amanda already has Suicide Squad in this universe. Very bad writing and continuity.The script is also very bad and stupid in a very smart, brave and heroic woman that suddenly gave up the world begging the villain to spare her son.And, many other stupid scenes. Too many to tell here.Shazam movie was miles better than this.This movie could be better. Or, maybe my expectation was too high.","

"kmontgomery-98515","14 November 2022","Aldis Hodge was a great Hawkman!!! Best live action version of that character.The backgrounds look like cut scenes from 2000s video games (or the Scorpion Game) and the lore dumps were painful. This should have been a 90 minute movie with none of that lore exposition until the last act. The entire beginning with the slaves and political talk was painful after seeing how artfully that's been handles in other movies.I would have preferred this movie to just have Hawkman & Black Adam team up against mercenaries instead of all the extra weird plot stuff. Kahndaq is suppose to be Sinai ruled by mercenaries but that doesn't make sense. Even in countries with large mercenary control there's always at least a fake government. They should have started with a map showing where this fictional country is (modern day Sinai, Egypt) and introduce us by showing the oppression of the citizens via mercenaries and the reverence to the statue. Cut to the mom reseructing Adam. All this in the cold open. Then Adam gors on a bad ramage of the mercs. Hawkman volunteers and goes and tries to stop him, fails, and then tries to convince him to be good. Boom - we now have anti-hero tension. Hawkman has to address whether due process is really working in fake Sinai and Black Adam has to realize that simply killing everyone in power doesn't work. But instead we got a 2 hour mess of a plot with an amazing cast. Oh well.","

"nazdezigns","30 November 2022","From the first part of the movie, well until to the last, this movie is full of plot holes. Using the Rock with already established persona and icon just ruining the character of Black Adam. The sadness and sorrow of Black Adam character just cant seems to appear. To do that you must have a top level acting. All too focus on the pride, vicious aspect of him. Also how come he knows english language after 5000 years in sleep?And Hawkman is a hero with blind loyalty on Waller (who's the leader of Suicide Squad that kills even many innocent people) seems to value the bad guys life than all the people of Khandaq - while we know that his fights and his plane crash is destroying the city with potential death all over - with dialogues that only satisfy elementary kids level.Dr fate can read peoples fate (and tell them), but cant seem to know the fate of his own word to others.Atom Smasher and Cyclone did not have a good character foundation and character development also with dull dialogues. You cant beat ant-man. You should go with genius Atom though.And cyclone throws pipes on rocket bomb invincible of Black Adam seems very wrong...The cringe Amon's mother is all to blame on all this incident but seems not have any remorse whatsoever. Except the loss of husband. Very selfish.The more ever cringe Amon character is like his dialogue are written by a high school kid that just enter the comic writing world.The zombies?? I know you need the people to do their part, but zombies appear out of nowhere with no role on the story and only fights the people? Come on...However, the special effect is great. They put a lot of money and effort in this. And also working with a real and professional DC comic book fan or writer on this aspect.Suggestion. Dont let the rock be the producer. Use professional comic book editor to do that.Like me, my 11 year old kid cant seems to enjoy the story but he enjoy the effects.","

"wannadance-70985","3 December 2022","First of all I must say, I am so glad (maybe even thankful) I did not go to the theater. If all you want is Dwayne Johnson, CGI, and an over abundance (AND I MEAN OVER ABUNDANCE) of slow motion action shots, then this movie is for you. The movie jumps in right away with the plot with zero set up. No backstory, nothing really beyond what made him BA and even that felt rushed. In interviews DJ said this movie is for fans. What fans? Not fans of superhero movies. I would rather watch the version of Joss Whedon's Justice league then watch this movie again. The way Atom Smasher and Cyclone were introduced is utterly laughable. If Dwayne Johnson is going to be one of the heavy hitters for DC Studios going forward and this is the of quality product made, it'll be a dead franchise in no time.","

"loganschainker","22 October 2022","My expectations for Black Adam were rather low. It was either going to be awful or dumb fun. Obviously, it was awful. I'm surprised this film is getting mixed reception, and not just flat-out bad reception. The story was bland, the CGI was terrible, and the dialogue was painfully generic. Dwayne Johnson delivered a very dull performance. Majority of his lines were (as I stated earlier) generic. The third act is nothing but loud, brain-frying, CGI nonsense. Apparently this film was supposed to be rated R, honestly it would have benefited significantly. We've seen before that DC has no quarrels with making they're films R. The story would have been way more interesting if the main ""antagonists"" were just the JLA. Who by the way were incredibly underused and underdeveloped. It could have made for a unique narrative that was told from a perspective that we don't usually see in comic-book films.","

That is to say at the start...The bad: this movie relies TOO heavily on CGI action scenes. There is a limit too how much CGI action upon action I can take, before my mind gets numb.I get it, this movie is targetted at teenagers, who just want an overload of flashing action packed scenes. But even for teenagers I would not recommend this movie, because this movie is seriously lacking in actor's chemistry.More bad; there are too many characters, too many action scenes, but WAY TOO few characters actually speaking and interacting with each other.Dwayne Johnson is cool as superman like action god, but he aint particularly funny this time around. And after the quatrillion CGI fight with Dwayne Johnson I fell asleep....Not terrible, but definitely not the best fantasy action movie either. NOT recommended...","

Only 2 of the superheroes made any contribution, so why add another 2 who didn't? One was the obvious comic relief, but the other had no purpose.Black Adam was pretty useless. A being possessing god -like powers, who is easily defeated? Come on. His disdain for life got old quickly. As did his disdain for doors. His attempts at humour failed badly.There was no point to this movie, and it's unlikely there will be a sequal.","

It has everything you need for a super hero movie.A great cast. In particular Pierce Brosnan. It's good to see him return to the big screen in such an iconic role.An original script.Amazing action scenes.You can tell that the movie was more than ten years in the making based on its attention to detail in the production. Starting from the special effects up to the costume designs.I don't know much about the original comic or the DC universe in general. But I love the idea of an anti-hero saving the world on its own terms. This grittier and darker approach totally works for me and could be a door opener for a whole new sub-genre.","

The Rock still cannot act and all attempts at it are stilted and wasteful of camera space. Don't pretend like this person can act - it is never going to be believed. Next - does every scene have to be accompanied by an orchestra - was a whole bunch of really bad music. The other super heroes were alright but it just didn't seem to be a good fit. And finally, when is CGI just way over the top because this was as close as it gets. Does CGI ever get to the point where film creators just use it to create great scenes as opposed to creating a scene that appears unbelievable while being unbelievable?","

By a clear margin the best superhero film in many years, with the Rock bringing a truckload of intensity and presence to the character, a great story from the point of view of the anti-hero that is not often told, and truly entertaining supporting characters. This is what fans want to see, this is how these movies should be made. And an absolute epic showdown incoming that is already building excitement.No one should have the slightest interest what the 'critics' have to say - very rarely do they write reviews focused on the actual content anymore. They are the antithesis of what art and movie-making represents - and they are gloriously being drowned out by this fantastic film. Thank you Rocky!","

Hawkeye and Fate were really good, others were okay but these two are actually the ACE in the team. I would only suggest anyone who is going to watch this movie. Don't compare it with anything else. Black Adam is its own movie. We have not seen any other movie with Anti-hero theme besides the ""Morbius"" but these two cannot be compared.

The DC people are just not my kind of movie makers, so I left the theater disappointed.Why is that? I like Marvel Movies better. The humor is light. The character development is done more efficiently. The action looks less Computer generated.DC's style just doesn't work for me. They take such joy in showing off Adam's Superman-like strenght, it becomes boring. Endless hovering and flying around with clenched fists... And the lightning looks exactly, like whenever The Flash does his thing. What they fail to do, is make me care about what happens to the characters. Pierce Brosnan is the exeption. But Cyclone? She is just a pretty face they kept showing me in slow motion.I did appreciate the dynamic between the Justice Society and Adam.I just think, DC worships their characters so much, they forget that they have people in the audience who have not read the books. These people needs to first get to know and then learn to like the characters in under an hour. Same with the villains. They can't just be a prop at the end. They too need character development. DC fails at that so often.The batman movies were the exeption. Justice League, Suicide Squad (not The..), Wonder Woman, etc. Are the rule.","

Thankfully due to the NEW owner Zaslav and NEW regime of WB Discovery that 4 year nightmare that began in 2017 ended and they are no longer listening to the haters anymore and have put thing right before the turmoil began.","

Other than that, I feel like they missed a golden opportunity to pay off such a historic team up in the Justice Society, especially we have seen cameos of 'the team', IIRC, in Stargirl, for instance. Really missed the mark on the DC verse hero characters, IMO. Fate, feel like he was nothing more than a fancy magician illusionist, one avenue removed from the Las Vegas strip; lost on this effort was the mystique in that persona. Hawkman, bold, bravado, maybe, about 50% passable delivery IMO. And there was one sequence, in particular, in which, was it really that necessary, even to setup 'what came next', overly gratuitous, unnecessary, IMO. By contrast, at least they had the class to suggest, 'and maybe smash a few things along the way' with Professor Hulk and Avengers Endgame. Cyclone, wasn't she 'white', granddaughter of Red Tornado? So of course they had to make her 'black'. Atom Smasher, no opinion really, other than it seemed like he was the latinx comic relief, actually just about all the 'heroes' had some misfit comic element about them. Which may be what they were aiming at considering the central figure was the villan (ahem) 'anti-hero' Black Adam. Any version of the character, though, I've ever seen depicted, is not so shallow, not so wooden, a bit more depth and range in his character, even in spite of him being a culturally distant misfit. Also one of the closing moments in the flick, feel like they missed a golden opportunity to pay off BA's 'team player' motif in Shazam power sharing, but maybe that is an ability exclusive to Shazam, IDK. About the only two personas they 'got right' at all, or that were consistent, anyway, with previous continuum efforts, was Waller and Harcourt, props for that segue, actually. Perhaps the only thing possibly worth mentioning was the Superman post credits segue, which of course is another classic.","

"kadenkgcampbell","20 October 2022","I believe that when rating a movie you must rate it for what it is, in the genre in which in belongs. This isn't a movie to take serious or a movie trying to attain awards. It's a action superhero movie and for it being that it was pretty great.The action was amazing and the CGI was great. I heard some people say the CGI was bad which boggles my mind of how picky and spoiled you must be. Black Adam fighting, the Dr Fate scenes, Cyclone and Adam Smasher it all looked amazing.Yes some parts were cliche but what can we expect? There's been 100s of superhero movies doesn't every movie ever have a least a few cliches? (Most definitely).The movie was much better than some other DC movies and I really enjoyed the overpowered beast of a character in Black Adam. The Rock did a great job for once being a wrestler. I am also SO GLAD Henry Cavill is back as Superman (we need the Man of Steel 2). It's been a long time since we've seen him. He's a perfect Superman. The Rock is a perfect Black Adam.","

"joshgerlach","7 December 2022","This movie is not bad per se.Interesting story, interesting twist, interesting action, very good effects.Dwayne Johnson, Quintessa Swindell, Noah Centineo, Aldis Hodge, Mohammed Amir, and Marwan Kenzari all do fine. Pierce Brosnan does excellently as always and I would love to see more of his Dr. Fate.Two actors stand out as particularly bad; Sarah Shahi, and Bodhi Sabongui. I don't know what caused this. It could be a number of things, but I think it could be boiled down to acting through an accent that was unnatural to them.Sabongui is Canadian, and Shahi is from Texas, and their ADR was also bad, so the accent is probably where I'd put my money on what went wrong there. They simply do a bad job. Sabongui has only 7 credits to his name, so I can hardly fault him for that, he should have been guided more.The canned cinematic score was a let down. Some of the rock songs were just weirdly placed, and they feel like an afterthought rather than a choice. Probably to try to connect it better to Shazam and The Suicide Squad, which it didn't really need. Chiseling out an identity of its own would have been better.4/10 take more risks. If you're gonna make billions globally anyway, it might as well also be a ripping good movie, too. If it's a studio interference problem, tell the studio to get bent.","

I am a huge fan of marvel and dc movies but I think it time to admit the new ""direction "" isn't working and get back to their roots and stop making expensive forgettable trash. I didnt care about one single character in this movie. No one to root for!!!! I can only recommend anyone watch this if you have nothing else to do, its free, and you aren't wasting your own electricity to see it. To the actors in this movie; fire your agents for doing this to you and stop letting producers of crap from using you.","

"opheophe","28 December 2022","What do we have...The story in short is:
# Black Adam is bad
# There are some other characters that has 0 impact on the story
# Black Adam is perhaps kinda good but in a bad way
# Kills bad guy no effort
# The endThe story in slightly more words...
# Black Adam was a bad superhero that got put to sleep
# Plottwist: His son was a good superhero, but he gave his powers to Adam to save him. Son got killed. Adam did bad things in revenge.# Bad guys want demon crown
# Plottwist: The bad guy is in fact an ancestor to the king Adams son defeated.# 4 superheroes appear: Hawkman (badly defined powers, no backstory), Dr Fate (can see into the future, badly defined powers, found a magic helmet in a 10 sec backstory), Cyclone (pointless, has no impact on the story at all, can make cyclones, badly defined powers), Atom Smasher (pointless, has no impact on the story at all, can become really big, like Ant-man but without the charm)
# Superheroes attack Black Adam with CGI, but Adam cannot be hurt by CGI.# Adam and superheroes team up
# Bad guy get demon crown but dies
# Adam gives up his powers for no reason, gets thrown in prison
# Plottwist: He died but by dying he gets demon powers
# The guy that can look into the future sees that things are going bad, frees Adam and then dies a pointless death.# Adam, without powers, appears to be invulnerable, regains his powers
# The bad guy summons the legions of hell. The legions gets defeated by 30 random people wielding blunt objects.# CGI fight with the bad guy, Adam wins
# The endWith a story like this, why wasn't the movie great?#####First of all, Adam is immortal, apart from when he was hurt for 30 sec in the beginning nothing can harm him. Even when he doesn't have his powers he's pretty much invulnerable. The superheroes can't really get hurt either. Dr Fate dies in his fight agains tthe bad guy, but it's announced in advance that he will die and that the bad guy will defeat him, meaning there's no surprise that the bad guy wont care no matter how much CGI Dr Fate throws at him. In the last fight between Adam and the bad guy neither can be harmed by the CGI at all, untill Adam rips the bad guy apart. The fights are perhaps well made, but when you know that noone will die (except when you know someone will die) there are no stakes and no surprises. I have to wonder... why do directors think that fights between immortal gods are fun to watch? Even Adam Wests batman from 1966 is more exciting since you don't know the outcome of every fight!#####Investment in characters... I don't care about Adam... I'm told he was bad, but then perhaps goodish... ok fine, he's immortal, who cares. Our other heroes... I don't care about them... They have no backstory, I have no emotional investment in them. Dr Fate dies, but you know he will in advance, there are no surprises at all! It would have taken only a minor rewrite to leave the other heres out from the movie completely, they are nothing but empty filler.The villain... he wants the crown, he gets the crown he dies. There is no investment in his goals. You barely even know if he has goals other than killing Black Adam.There is also a mother and her son, but they are so generic and bland you don't really care about them. The mother finds the crown, her kid almost gets killed, Almost no impact on the story.In other words, you don't care about any of the characters. They are emtpy shells. If each of the characters had had an origin story, perhaps their own movie, you might care, but they don't. In Marvels End-game you care about Stark dying because you've been with that character through a lot of movies, the death has impact and meaning. If he had died in the first movie without having any impact at all noone would have cared.#####The plottwists... why do we have the plottwists?A plottwist is a nice storytelling device when it surprises you...
But... the original hero wasn't Adam but his son, and his son died to give Adam his powers... why? Just let Adam have the powers and start out with good intentions but go bad when his son dies, no need for a twist!<eneric good guy is in fact are a generic bad guy that wants a crown isn't really doing anything. Had we been invested in the character as a good guy him being bad might have had some impact, but we don't get invested in characters at all here. And the plottwist that he's in fact related to the bad king... who cares? We're still not invested in him.Dr Fate sees that Hawkman will die... but in a twist he decides to kill himself for no reason at all. He could just have said, oh, hol' up folks, let's free Adam and let him deal with the bad guy.The twists add nothing, they almost seems tacked on in the script. Remove them and it would have been the same movie.#####This movie isn't exactly bad, it's just bland and pointless. Unlike Shazam it isn't even funny. It's understandable that DC wants ensamble movies just like Marvel, but they don't make any attempts to get you invested in them. The technical quality of the movie is overall good, the acting is good, the casting is good. There is even fairly good chemistry between the characters. Just a pity the script is bad.As for the fights... CGI-fights with characters flying all around, with noone ever reacting to getting punched into the ground etc... those fights are not fun. Considering the budgets they should be able to hire someone to make the fights engaging. Perhaps the story isn't great, and perhaps the characters aren't developed, but if the fights are fun you can still enjoy it, just like you enjoy cheesy 1-man-army movies from 1980-1990.#####Final judgement: Watch this movie if you've got nothing else to do. You will get a bit bored at the CGI-fights and you wont care about any of the characters... at all... but perhaps you want some mindless fodder for the brain.","

"lakings97","24 October 2022","Black Adam is a DC movie with Dwayne Johnson as Teth Adam who is brought back to current time after 5,000 years of imprisonment. Justice Society with a group of superhero's aim to stop Back Adam from destroying his home town of Kahndaq which is a made up country like Wakanda where the country is under suppression. The superhero's headed by Hawkman played by Aldis Hodge, Kent Nelson played by Pierce Brosnan, Atom Smasher played by Noah Centineo, and Cyclone played by Quintessa Swindell. Each have similar characteristics as Marvel characters, DC always plays second fiddle they can never match up to Marvel but this flick was not half bad. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that when Black Adam was first came on screen he immediately knew how to speak English. Sarah Shahi played a big role as the person who released Black Adam. Overall it was a fun, entertaining, and delightful movie I definitely recommend.","

The plot of the film is predictable and repetitive. Is now a product devoid of originality, they always repeat the usual plots. Is now an old and overused product. 1/10, ""Black Adam repetitive."" An overall bellow average movie in a franchise that is way beyond its prime and runs purely on nostalgia.A forgettable film, nothing memorable.

"Mykewood","21 October 2022","Slight spoilers I guess.I went in with low expectations. The scenes copied from every other super hero film, the terrible CGI sets (how did the scene of the JSA flying out of their underground base look worse than a very similar scene from the 1st X-men film, 22 years ago? How is that even possible?), the CGI monstrosity ""villain"" at the end... Really derailed a decent film. Adam's true origin was a nice twist. I really liked Hawkman & Dr Fate. Just wish we'd gotten more time with them. Adam Smasher & wind girl were ok but ultimately forgettable. I feel like they needed to allow more time with Adam, the woman, & her son 1st. Establish the city villains fully. Then have the JSA come in. Also the hypocrisy of Hawkman yapping at Adam when he works for AMANDA WALLER? Like, really? Fate knows everything, but doesn't know they work for one of the worst people on the planet? Would have been much better to explore that than the video game boss at the end. Lost opportunity. 5/10.","

"justinyap","25 October 2022","Black Adam is poorly written and unnatural paced while packs with plot holes, cringey sequences, and weak side-character development. Short screentime between main character and side characters make it even more pointless and emotionless, and plenty of awkward acting from fast paced sequence cringes the mood throughout the film, However, the humour, action sequences and tone are slightly above average which makes the only positive aspects for the show. Meanwhile, The Rock nailed the character well and the whole film exceeded personal expectation making it sufficiently entertaining for a mere 2 hours.","

"christopherstamp","19 October 2022","The start of this movie was quite good - when you first meet black Adam. It feels like a super hero movie mixed with flavours and graphic violence of Indiana jones. Watching a man be reduced to ash in front of your eyes - felt like the scene from Raiders.Also Dwayne's movements, lack of effort to tear vehicles in half, etc. Was perfect to watch. As an individual of this strength would do these things with little effort like when we trample grass.However the rest of the movie feels like repeats of previous movies combined. Either early comic book movies = X-men - Ceribro like interiors, x-men - manor building.To recent AntMan retreads, trying to copy but falling short to add anything new.To Jason and the argonauts = with strange chi skeletons with swords.Also it feels like extremely long actions sequences, lead directly into another extremely long (and repetitive) action sequences. Which are unnecessary, and feel like where included just because 1 person in the creative team likes it so kept it in (hover bikes + bike chase).Unfortunately it is due to the repeated dejavu that brings you out of the movie.Lastly the writing could have been better and again pulls you out of the movie.Why does Black Adam know modern catchphrases? Why is humor forced in? To copy Marvel? Why are popular 80s songs sprinkled in randomly?Overall: good potential - however tries to do to much, and also relieve too heavily on what has came before and been successful in other superhero and pop cultural movies.","

The story line is a bit odd at times, almost repetitive and the movie is 20mins too long. There are plenty of laughs, which were fun but I honestly think because DJ is the actor - it can't be so serious.I'm starting to feel we are near the end of all these standard good vs evil super hero films done this way... very clean, simple plot, same formula. Yea Batman, Superman and a few others will survive because they tend to have a deeper plot. Look even Star Wars is getting warn out; same plot different actors.","

There you have it - a mindless 2 hour movie, intended to be entertaining but falls short.Dwayne Johnson barely phones in his part as Black Adam.The other actors, including Pierce Brosnan, seem to be there as mostly wallpaper. The movie ends with a hint that there will be a Black Adam 2. I sincerely hope not, unless they have a chance to improve on the theme.

There are also some dumb decisions made by the bad guys that doesn't make any sense either!The CGI is good, the action sequences are different than Marvel. And like any DC film as of this point, the characters are fragmented, shallow, no backstories.There is a lot of killing in this movie, you could say comedic killing hence the PG-13 rating.

He's eventually going to get that crown and our hero is going to beat him. This might sound like a spoiler but when you watch the movie, you already know what's going to happen next and it's exactly what you think would happen. The acting is awkward. Many lines were forced. The camera work isn't quite there yet. In that I mean there is a shot where the hawk guy says we need Adam to do it, but then he's already gone, and before the audience can react to it the movie already cut to the next scene with loud music and action sequences. It lacks clarity in telling you what's going on. And what's up with all the zombies? They like making zombie movie? Well this feels like a B-movie quality plot. I can't believe they even made this movie this bad. The music in itself is okay but the way they pair it with the visuals just make everything a noise rather than a piece to enjoy.","

"matt_hew","10 July 2023","If any producers or directors want a blueprint of how to make a superhero movie than this anti-hero film is the antithesis of that blueprint.From the outset you can just tell that it is going to be awful and the formulaic tick box clichés come thick and fast.Starts with a very quick world building backstory exercise.Jumps to present day and the mother / son dynamic fighting the good cause.The double crossing 'friend' who is a relation to the original enemy of Adam from 5000 years ago.A bunch of thugs who have teleporting hover bikes (just because)The hero getting injured (although he could heal himself instantly) in order to connect with the family.The hero subsequently having to question his own motives.A bunch of other heroes to battle with and fill the required Superhero quota.The creation of a new 'Big Bad' just in time for the finale.And it gets worse. Marvel and DC in particular were known for stealing each others characters and creating their own versions. This movie takes it one step further with The Justice Society Heroes being too much like rejects from the Marvel movies. Hawkman is too much like Falcon, Atom Smasher is a mash up of Deadpool & Ant-Man, Doctor Fate is Doctor Strange which makes the film feel second rate.Add to that the thin acting a typical, repetitive story, awful nonsensical editing & direction and the overuse of comedic one liners and CGI to fill in the cracks and you have Black Adam.","

"ethanbresnett","27 October 2022","Black Adam is not as good as some people would have you believe, but it definitely isn't as bad as some others would have you believe. It's a very average film with plenty of flaws but some decent moments.Firstly there's the performance from The Rock. He's just The Rock. As he is in every film. He's not a bad actor, but he's very one note and doesn't have the ability to get lost in a role and truly sell it. It's a fine performance though, full of bravado and he fills the screen and looks the part.The comedy is a mixed bag. I did find myself chuckling a few times for my sins, but some of it really didn't land (I'm looking at you Atom Smasher).The action isn't the best. There are some cool moments but they quickly become repetitive and it never really excited me. The final act had a couple of neat set pieces but was mostly derivative of the genre, and doesn't treat new ground at all.For the most part the script is pretty cliche and tired. It tries to have something interesting to say about imperialism and foreign powers interfering in other countries, but then casts an American in the lead role which feels very shortsighted and undermines what could have been an interesting angle.Perhaps my biggest gripe with this film is the ridiculously excessive exposition through flashbacks and narration. It absolutely butchers the pacing of the film and makes for a very disorienting watch at times.Black Adam is a perfectly fine watch, but it's not a film I'll likely return to. The flaws are glaring and the good moments are too few and far between.","

"camilogilmouzo","24 October 2022","This is one of the worst superhero movies ever made. The story is extremely basic, the characters are very topical, a self-parody, a combative mom, a son who pretends to be cool, but skateboards around like he's Bart Simpson (the 90's were long ago, man) an uncle fat guy who drives a van and is the easy comic resource... We didn't like all the protagonists, everyone, from the heroes to the villains, was too stupid, really. And the jokes are for young children, but with so many violent deaths, it is not a children's film.I don't know who wrote the script, but I bet on the producer's 14-year-old nephews, after having smoked a little marijuana. They wrote the script in less than the length of the movie, and they never revised it.I went to the movies with several friends and we all thought the same thing, that we had lost a couple of hours of our lives.

"jace_the_film_guy","21 October 2022","Big and loud, ""Black Adam"" is exactly what you would expect from a superhero - or anti-hero - movie starring Dwayne Johnson. The action sequences are impressive, which fits the bill for the DCEU. The result is surprisingly graphic (shades of ""Multiverse of Madness"") compared to most other films in the genre. Like most modern superhero movies, there is some forced humor, but not too much.Some of the best scenes are the introduction to Kahndaq (the main setting) and flashbacks to 2,600 BC. The story is also surprisingly grounded and contained in one location for the most part. While it is difficult to relate to a character as indestructible as Black Adam, the stakes were low enough to garner some investment.Dwayne Johnson does a fine job of embodying the titular character, but the rest of the cast is lackluster. The supporting heroes needed more depth or to have been left out. There were some moments where a strong emotional reaction was warranted, but a lack of character development left me disconnected.With a runtime right at 2 hours, the film tackles the source material effectively. That being said, the second act leaned heavier on explosions and fight scenes than character growth. There were moments reminiscent of Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" movies, which is both a compliment and a frustration. Ultimately, when a hero is indestructible, overly powerful, and God-like, it is difficult to connect, which is this movie's biggest flaw.""Black Adam"" is one of the stronger entries in the DCEU, especially compared to ""Dawn of Justice"" and ""Justice League"". The film took its time building up to the inevitable which caused the plot to drag a bit, but it has recognizable identity. The last few months have lacked tentpole films, and this movie fills that void.Best Character: Amon
Best Scene: The mid-credit scene

You don't get involved as all characters are bland and there is zero chance at feeling anything is seriously at stake. All that remains is a yawn worthy series of bad cgi scenes, faux grand scale, offensively juvenile humor, and...... okay, there is a saving grace, the electrician uncle is fun. He is the one star from the two i gave this film.So the rock's superpower is that he looks incredibly pumped up but he offsets it with a kind of charisma of having a sense of humor that is self-aware. Now, this is missing from this film completely.Aldis hodge... sorry, he just does not cut it as a superhero. He doesn't have the gravitas, and his smarm and smirk that usually works in his favor just falls flat here.Piece brosnan... besides the paycheck, what was he thinking?!And that's it.

For example (love and thunder)2) Dr. Fate sacrifice himself to save his friends.Like he couldn't see in the future the coming of the evil guy.3) Dewayne he didn't even sweat to put an accent at least a bit.4) Heroes who want to save the people and protect them but the city got to the level of an atomic bomb.And the end why to pay to watch this movie?

"thajudheen","27 November 2022","In the first few minutes after Black Adam is introduced, he takes on a dozen or so elite soldiers and comes out on top. Naturally, the soldiers call in backup to throw everything, and Adam takes them out in a slow-mo sequence. (If this was an attempt to recreate the fun sequences with X-Men's Quicksilver, it falls flat.)Now that we have established that our lead is indestructible, where do we go? The screenwriters seem to have to settled for an approach to go everywhere and see what works. So we follow a few secondary characters ending up in mortal peril, a city that's been under oppressive leadership for years (millennia, apparently), an ancient artifact, the 'Justice Society', Adam's own backstory etc.What results is a movie that's just tolerable to watch. Action sequences are aplenty, but with an indestructible hero, there are no stakes to talk about. The secondary characters fail to leave any mark on the story, and the emotional beats don't land well.There are a few good things about the movie: Adam's origin story is interesting and comes with a few twists. The action sequences, despite the lack of stakes as noted above, are still fun. The post-credits scene sets up the next movie, which promises to be an interesting watch.","

"arungeorge13","26 November 2022","A film that's supposed to play out as an anti-hero origin story comes across as a series of flashy set-pieces knit together by an extremely thin and dispassionate plot. It's clear from the very first scene that director Jaume Collet-Serra (well-known for his Liam Neeson actioners) is only interested in making the film look great with his stylistic choices and not dig into the meat of the lead characters. The Justice Society makes an appearance (with only Brosnan managing to leave a mark purely due to his charisma) although these scenes do nothing except create empty (yet beautiful) spectacle.If there's one achievement the writers managed with Black Adam, it is in portraying the titular character as unpredictable. He could definitely sway either way, but heck, give him less generic lines whenever he speaks, maybe? Johnson speaks comparatively less in the film, and he isn't able to bring anything unique to the role other than his staggering physique. I'd rate it almost as bad as David Ayer's Suicide Squad, with most characters not clicking, and an antagonist that's best not discussed in detail. The Superman cameo in the mid-credits raises hopes a little.","

It almost feels like DC made this just to give an act of revenge on Marvel and they can do it just because these big corporations have huge piles of cash, nice, these guys are just digging a deeper grave for cinema, idiots.Overall, it's a good one-time watch if you were/are a kid, and that too only if you like watching laser shows.","

The story line was bland, the CGI was horrible, and the acting was terrible. Nothing felt epic. I look to my left and my brother is knocked out, I look back to the movie and find my self dozing off to how bored I was. Luckily I had the best chicken tenders from cinema cafe, so I wasn't to mad. Until I finished them and it felt like the movie would never end. But on a serious note, a lot of movies now a days is feeling like there is thought, effort, or time put into these movies.

"uncleoyster","26 November 2022","This thing had much going for it, at least in the idea department, and it could have been great. Sadly, it fails on too many fronts. For all its good ideas, it's honestly just too clumsily done. The incompetence on display is surprising at this level of blockbuster moviemaking. This is B grade stuff.For starters, the screenplay needed at least two more passes. Flesh out the characters, not just the set pieces. Finesse the dialogue. Have them interact believably. Make us care! For one, the movie fails to balance its tone, which makes the small attempts at comedy fall flat. And sadly, the character Hawkman comes off as severely stupid. Every action he takes, every word he utters, only serves to escalate the conflict and further endanger the people they claim to protect. At one point I was sure I was watching Team America. Thus, his implied friendship with Fate comes off as unearned - Fate would never suffer such foolishness. When I don't believe the characters I get taken straight out of the movie, and it's so hard to engage afterwards.Speaking of Fate... How very dareyou kill off my favourite character in his very first movie? Unnecessary. Unearned. Unbelievable.The director should be replaced. We see what he's going for, but as implied earlier he's not competent enough to accomplish any of it. The scope here should be vast and the stakes should feel massive, but instead we don't care and the flick looks and feels small and unengaging.The storytelling here is very rushed. We skip from location to location with no room for the characters to breathe. We never get to know them, and so nothing they do really matters. Pierce Brosnan at least tries to make his meager material work, oh how he tries, but the flick just won't let him. It's frustrating to watch.Dwayne is sorely miscast in any role that requires depth of character. That dude is a movie star, not an actor.I won't harp too much on the CG stuff, we know those guys are underpaid and overworked, and they never have enough time to make a solid product. That said, the Final Boss™ looked laughably bad and I blame the studio and producers.Even the music is generic and lacklustre. I just can't with this thing.I don't really know why at this point, but I expect better.","

Still can't figure out how in a superhero movie the writing was so bad, it's a superhero movie not an Oscar winning drama doesn't, you dont need much writing ability.Feels like they imitated/copied scenes from other movies badly. During the movie they are looking for a special and strongest steel (god knows why) familiar to anyone? Again they put in the magic word ""Shazam"" why, how at least if you have already brought this narrative up again, give a minimal explanation to the average viewer so that he will understand this nonsense.","

The cast, the performances, the effects & direction (Jaume Collet-Serra) and the three-man writing here are all vastly inferior to the slew of Marvel equivalents. It's a dull & unoriginal turd.

"kjproulx","3 November 2022","Besides the living Hollywood legends, as far as Blockbusters go, Dwayne Johnson is one of the only names out there that will draw a crowd. These days, it's all about the spectacle or whether or not a good story is enough to pull people in. The way of the Hollywood star is going away, but Johnson is one of the few keeping that notion alive. I'm saying this because I don't think this film would be getting as much attention without him in the leading role, and I also don't think I would've enjoyed it as much without this particular cast. Here's why, although it's a mess, you may get some enjoyment out of Black Adam, as I did.Imprisoned for over 5,000 years, a man named Teth Adam is unleashed on the world. The Justice Society, a team of superpowered individuals, is on the hunt for him when they find this out, but more significant threats will take precedence. Having the powers of the Egyptian Gods, Teth Adam begins to tear apart and kill anyone who stands against him. This was his moral code back in the day and still remains. The fish-out-of-water scenarios are what made this film enjoyable though.Dwayne Johnson plays a more stoic version of his beloved persona and I thought it worked well here. On top of that, I thought the additions of Aldis Hodge (Hawkman), Pierce Brosnan (Dr. Fate), Noah Centineo (Atom Smasher), and Quintessa Swindell (Cyclone) as the Justice Society were all great and played off each other well. It was the fact that I loved all the characters that left me overall enjoying this film. The biggest issue is that it moves very quickly and tells two films' worth of story in about two hours. There was no room for anything to breathe.In the end, I'm not complaining about the pace of the film because that's the furthest thing from the problem. It moves at a very solid pace, but The Justice Society comes basically out of nowhere and because I liked all the characters so much throughout this film, I really wish we had a film or series that fleshed them out more. Great characters with zero backstories are just frustrating. It's filled with great superhero action and Dwayne Johnson is very good in the role, and Jaume Collet-Serra did a great job directing an exciting film, but I do feel that the writers just stuffed too much into a film that felt small-scale in terms of scope and locations. By no means a great movie, but if you're looking for some fun action that you can enjoy some popcorn with, this is it.","

"ryan-44110","19 November 2022","One of DC's better anti-heroes unfortunately gets the same treatment as Snyder's Justice League. I presume originally a 4hr long movie, reduced to 2hrs and leaving most of the audience who likely doesn't have any insight or prior knowledge of the Justice Society, Dr. Fate, Hawkman, etc clueless as to who comprises the protagonist mash up. Johnson does a good job of conveying the internal struggle and motivation of Teth Adam, but the film doesn't do a good job of explaining how he and Shazam both exist at the same time in the same universe. It also doesn't explain who bestowed the power to the wizards to be given to a champion. We're dumped in a timeline 5000 years ago, and told about a mythical location in dire straits by an oppressive ruler. That bleeds over to modern day to set up our villain arc. Going by the comics, we should've at least had some interaction or plot with Egyptians and their gods, but nada. Major let down.Leading us head first into plot, we're given the Justice Society, which may as well be the Justice league of B-list heroes. Pretty underwhelming. If you don't know Dr. Fate and company, you're going to be confused. There's little to no backstory on them or their previous adventures, or their reason for being. There's also no reason given as to why the Justice League isn't the one responding to the crisis either. The child actor in this is awful. His voice is terrible, especially when he shouts, acting is not convincing, and I was hoping they'd take him off screen for an extended period, but he was with us pretty much the whole way. Was this the best child actor they could find...?Best part about the whole movie? Johnson never once does the eyebrow thing in this movie, thankfully.All in all, good action flick, borderline gore but maintains its PG-13 rating. The best part is the end credits scene. Personally, a sequel isn't needed.","

I had colleagues telling me that watching this movie would be a waste of time - I didn't believe them at first but now I can confirm they were right.Even though hero movies (Marvel etc) are ""over the top"" with the super powers and all, this film lacked the refined touch and depth of those movies.I had the feeling that The Rock didn't actually want to take part in this movie but had to because he was bound by some contract or something. His usual energy and ""presence"" (if you get what I'm trying to express) was somehow missing.Maybe just a feeling but that is my impression.","

"theredsky","20 November 2022","This felt like a bad video game. The Rock is a very charismatic guy but I don't have a clue why he hyped this up as a game changer for the DCU. It's the most bland Superhero film of the year. No one here feels adequately developed with the exception of Black Adam himself but even then his development is very surface level. I think what annoys me most about this movie is that there is a good film hidden here. This film talks about Superheros coming in and invading places for the sake of ""peace"". That's a really cool idea that should be developed more in Superhero movies but it isn't here. Here it's a throwaway line which definitely annoyed me because it means the writers saw the opportunity and decided not to develop it. The performances are okay. The Rock is just being The Rock which is charming enough and Pierce Brosnan is definitely making an attempt here with the script he was given. Everyone else is fine. Their powers and abilities are cool but they would be cooler if their characters weren't so surface level. The visual effects look like they come out of a PS2 or PS3 however it definitely feels like the VFX artists were crunched for time. There's also a tone problem here. Sometimes the film likes to mimic Zack Snyder's style and sometimes it tries to mimic James Gunk's comedy. They don't mix together well here though because neither of those individuals worked on this movie. The villain here sucks. Honestly, having Black Adam have beef with the Justice Society worked decently well but they just had to throw in a stereotypical CGI 3rd act villain and it doesn't work at all. I can't even remember the villains name. Unless you really care about these characters or the DCU in general then I would avoid this.","

"JayWolfgramm","24 January 2023","""Black Adam"" is a film that had a lot of production problems. Dwayne Johnson was cast in the role back when he still had hair and looked just like the comic book character. Sometimes this can just be a little side note for the movie. In this case, it is obvious in the final film that the script was written 16 years ago.By 2022, we have a LOT of options when it comes to superhero movies and ""Black Adam"" does nothing new to make it stand out from the bunch. Maybe when the script was written in 2007 these ideas seemed novel, but by now it is all derivative of other films that do it better.I will give the film this: I actually think it balances its humor better than the recent Marvel movies. The film has a fair number of jokes, but they are all character-based jokes and they fit within the tone the film has set. Pierce Brosnan and Dwayne Johnson have a fun dynamic and they work well off of each other. At least for the most part, there are several jokes that don't land. But in general, I thought the side characters could get a few good laughs and were engaging for the screen time they got.The storyline hinges on some pretty big plot holes they hope the audience ignores. The whole central conflict between Black Adam and the Justice Society could be settled with a simple 3 second conversation. Why would they have an issue with him killing bad guys, when in this DC world ALL the superheroes go around killing bad guys?This is another film that does not understand how to do villain centric stories. In this film, Black Adam is not a villain, or even an antihero, he is just a hero who keeps saying ""I'm not a hero.""The action is well helmed at times, but it is the simple conversation scenes that the editor feels compelled to cut to pieces. The action scenes themselves ring hollow because no punch does any damage to Black Adam. They can throw him through as many buildings as they want, it doesn't get a scratch on him. They introduce a weakness for him, but never have it come up in any of the fights.Any goodwill the movie had going for it, is lost in the final act. It unravels down to the same old DC CGI battle with a stupid underdeveloped villain. And to top things off, they include a post-credit tease that is never going to pay off. Throughout the film, Black Adam feels the wizards gave the power to the wrong man. The wizards may not have chosen the wrong man, but I have chosen the wrong movie.","

From start to finish the Special Effects, the plot, the action scenes and the acting was on point. It had me at the edge of my seat. Non stop action and non stop heroes. They really got the formula right on this one. It opened up the DC universe to so many opportunities that I am sure (if done right) will surpass all our expectations. Thank you D. J. for this movie.

"Kazombie","21 October 2022","Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson gets top marks for making his Black Adam just as steely and imposing as in the DC comics.There are tons of action scenes featuring the Justice Society, obviously. Cyclone's beautiful twisters are a unique joy to watch and they add some welcome color to the film's visual palette. You can finally see Doctor Fate on screen and see how the other comic brand has ripped off and created a woke and weaker version in the form of the DS.Black Adam indulges to the perfect point where it's hard not to enjoy the DC anti-hero's debut. It's packed with fleshed out characters and an excessive number of adrenalin pumping action scenes, to the point where it outclasses any other outing and shows what it means to be a hero even in the midst of all the noise. DC has managed to capture lightning in a bottle and Black Adam manages to find its spark and then some.My previous positive reviews for DC films get rejected. Anything negative about other brands also get rejected. Who is moderating these reviews??Two final words: Post credit! Excellent return for the DCEU. Welcome home indeed!","

But as for a $195-200 million movie, it is flawed in many ways. 50% bad CGI negated 50% good CGI, weak and clueless direction, amateurish writing, some of the actors and their performances and dialogue delivery were weak and uninteresting. A mishmash storytelling that got tangled up in extreme weirdness. Poor music choices in important moments and the sound editing and mixing department ruined a lot scenes and broke the immersion. If this movie had a visionary director and a good screenwriter the outcome would've been very much different and I'm talking about the poor reviews and the disappointing box-office performance.","

There isn't much to this movie other than to satisfy your craving for action and superhero fight sequences.The problem with Black Adam is that this feels like it's trying to copy the MCU winning formula. It tries to land at humor but can't because of Dwane Johnson's emotionless acting or just feels out of place and forced. And the character himself, Black Adam is just not super interesting. He's that character with no inherent weaknesses nor any emotions that make us like the character. But I can say I liked the other characters in the film, like Doctor Fate and Hawkman. Everyone else in the film was uninteresting that they're only there for filling in roles.I can only say that Black Adam is alright in the action and the side heroes that show up, but the rest of the movie is lacking one thing that makes superhero movies great: character development. And no, having a flashback scene to tell the origin of Black Adam does not count as character development.","

Well, Marvell films lately have gone down the tube so much recently I don't even watch them any more. This was similarIf you are a massive Rock fan you will watch this no matter what. I'm the same but I feel the older the Rock is getting the more I tire of him. Particular now he has put so much emphasis on bulking up. It's not a good look. His body is no longer no proportional. He has put too much effort in his chest and this is massive but his lower body is small. A bit like watching a Rod Stewart on steroids. I think Ryan Reynolds would have been a better fitI did not like the story and this film was no different to any other super hero film coming out recently.Nothing special. It did have some good special effects and some funny moments but it was mediocre in terms of a super hero filmThe high rating is no doubt because the Rock was in it.","

"thebiffinator","29 October 2022","I was forced to go watch this because of my family. Every movie with the rock is the same. Terrible acting and predictable. Plot is ridiculous and boring. Action scenes are bland. Thank God Marvel didn't sign him, otherwise he'd never go away. I really hope DC understands they don't need to keep going with crap like this. Dwayne can never make a movie good. There are millions of people that are so tired of Dwayne. He's reached a point in his life where he needs to retire and go away. He's like a cockroach. He's in everything. Bring back Superman or something. Hire new faces and actors. Give us something new!","

"StevieG338","24 October 2022","For anyone giving this move anything under 7, I have no idea what you are looking for from a superhero movie. Some of the rating just don't make sense, this was an entertaining movie.This is a total departure from the other DCEU (Snyder) movies. The tone is totally different and far more entertaining overall.Firstly, the action is excellent. The casting is great, Brosnan is amazing as Doctor Fate and Aldis Hodge is excellent as Hawkman. The jokes aren't forced and are well placed and the story is pretty good. I would definitely watch more DC movies like this.Went to the theatre to see with my wife, we both really enjoyed it.","

"fredperry492","24 November 2022","I really enjoyed the film. If you're a Rock fan you'll definitely enjoy it. I don't fall much for the hype surrounding any film, good or bad. Yes, there are a few woke elements in it and they did tarnish the films enjoyment, but not too many. They were bearable.I liked the storyline, liked most of the characters, but I have to say the so called super heroes.....not particularly great on any level. It does kind of feel like the film industry is scraping the bottom of the barrel for 'another super hero'. They just felt like 'B' super heroes, I guess.Don't get me wrong, the main character was fine, funny in places and all round enjoyable.If you like Super Hero films, go see it.","

"BadurBey","10 November 2022","8.4/10.This movie had a lot of great moments and a lot of cringe moments for lack of a better term. Dwayne Johnson As Black Adam was an absolute perfect casting with his performance being spectacular. The action and cinematography were amazing. The acting was alright as some characters nailed it and others didn't (THE BOY). Hawkman kinda stole the movie for me. His character arc from viewing the world as black and white or good and evil, to a more moderate viewpoint was interesting. His dynamic with Doctor Fate was the best part of the movie.Now for the downsides the action scenes were pretty good but felt dragged out. The constant cuts to slo mo didn't help either. The acting especially for the kid and his mother was mediocre. Overall a B Tier movie.","

"Snootz","19 November 2022","If you're looking for constant, never-stops action, a high body count, a typical Dwayne Johnson character that's exactly like all other characters he plays, and a hefty hunk of Satanism thrown in (at the very end, to make sure everyone is already hooked), this is the movie for you.I'm sure there are a lot of comic boys and The Rock fans who will just love this movie. But seriously, the director didn't make any effort at all to give Johnson a chance to portray a different character than he always plays.The story is ho hum and highly predictable. The redeeming factor is that we get to see characters we don't ordinarily see: Doctor Fate, Cyclone, a really kick-tail Hawkman, and Atom Smasher (well, we've seen a giant Ant Man before, but this is uh... different).The CGI of course is incredible. The story isn't stoopid, so there's that. But it's also not very impressive. We went in expecting a comic book movie, and that's what we got.I had been hoping for something a little different, an anti-hero that gave a different feel to the whole film. But Dwayne simply can't help being fun and charming. I was expecting a character that makes Batman look tame, but nope. Typical super hero flick (oh wait, we can't forget ""I'm not a super hero"").Ah well, it's another fix for the adrenaline junkies. ; )","

"jonathanmarklund","22 November 2022","Black Adam is by no means a great movie, but it is far better than I thought it would be. I was expecting something along the lines of 'Ant Man' or 'Shazam'. But Adam has more depth too it then just a side-character's origin story. It actually has an identity of it's own, and much of this is due to the actors doing a really good job.The CGI is ""okay"". The rendering is good, but the physics and the animation is a bit stiff. I think another 2-3 months in development would have done this movie good.But other than that, I think it's a solid movie. You don't need to be a hardcore nerd to follow the plot and you don't need to watch every DC movie that came before it to enjoy this (thank God for that.)So yeah, get some popcorn, lower your expectations, and just watch a superhero movie.","

This is a very boring movie.The writing is particularly bland and much of the 'humorous banter' is tired gals flat.If the writers' strike currently going on (mid-2023) is intended to protect the people who wrote this they won't get much sympathy and deserve very little support.The superheroes are not very interesting and all seem a bit whimpy with no real personalities or substance. And a main premise of a good superhero film is that you want the good guys to win, but in this there are none that are really worth saving and definitely none who you worry about when they seem to be threatened.","

"buih-47731","25 November 2022","Black Adam is a movie. It has characters, and there most certainly is a plot.Black Adam is however, not a very good movie.It is endlessly boring. The only saving grace is the unending, and effortless charisma of Pierce Brosnan, which doesn't say much as the man can simply exist in a room, and I would be mildly entertained for an hour or two.I have more or less forgotten the plot to the film. The ending was patently insane, inept and un-understandable.The acting is wooden and stiff, and the dialog is absolutely the worst.The Rock, the otherwise funny and charismatic ""dude"" does not work as an angry and brooding man. He simply does not fit the character of Black Adam. In fact, Black ""Teth"" Adam, is a very poorly written brooding dark evil person. His motivations are strange, his intentions are completely unknown.He's just pushed around by the plot. Climax happens, because ""plot"" and the movie ends.It's not good.Go spend your money on a really good movie, like Bullet Train or Top Gun Mav.3/10.","

"finetunes","22 November 2022","1st time I watched the movie I dozed off in a couple of places and, of course, that could explain my confusion after the movie was over. Who was this group of superheroes fighting Black Adam? I must have fallen asleep when they were properly introduced; I barely caught there names. The plot seemed to explode with world building and even more world building, couldn't they have come up with a story with less padding of details? The writer and director tried to pack a trilogy into one movie. Again I blamed my lapses into sleep so I watched it again, and again I fell asleep but in different sections. I tried to put it all together but do I blame my falling asleep for not grasping this movie or do I blame the incomprehensibleness for putting me to sleep?Something else and very important - the movie gave off a weird vibe - who were the good guys and who were the bad guys, they all seemed a bit unlikeable.It's one thing to give a movie novel plot twists and unique characters but it takes creativity and inventiveness to come up with something likeably new. I wish I knew how to underline ""likeably"". One day I'll give this movie another chance and see how right or wrong I was on this review. Maybe there needs to be a 4 hour Zak Snyder's cut to fix this mess of a movie. It was poor storytelling.P. S. I just looked up the director on IMDB - he directed Jungle Cruise??? How could they let him direct a huge budget movie like Black Adam after directing a mediocre movie like Jungle Cruise.?? I'd sure like to know the decision-making process behind that.","

I genuinely think the casting is inspired for most characters, and you can see the ghost of what could have been a truly great performance by mr johnson but sadly the direction fails to make anything out of it. I have to assume this was constructed by committee and as such dont want to put all the blame for the failures on any one part of the production team but the final product never amounts to more than the some of its parts and each of those parts feels like it was pulled from a different movie. In the end the parts that work keep it watchable if you turn your brain off and dont listen to like 90 percent of the dialogue.","

I said it.Weak world-building, non-sensical action (how does this guy even know how to use a grenade immediately after awakening from 5000 years of sleep?) and wayyyy too much slow-mo that looks like it's a middle schooler's rip-off off Marvel's amazing quicksilver scenes. The cast seems unable to exhibit real emotion and the dialogue is cringe. None of the character's choices or motivations make sense. The 'story' seems like it's just there to find a way to add one uninspiring action sequence after another. The CGI is good, but pales in comparison to other Marvel or DCU films. There is little suspension of disbelief.Don't get me wrong, I really like Dwayne Johnson but he's better off starring as a co-star in a jungle themed comedy thriller with Kevin Hart rather than a superhero.","

And how is the Rock so popular...? I don't get it, I have nothing against him there's a clear audience for his movies but I just don't see the appeal, he is okay but he is literally the same character in every single film...","

"and-46245","17 December 2022","I can't imagine why adults would enjoy this. I stopped watching this about 20 minutes into the movie, I didn't check the timer though.Why did I stop there? Well, that's when the movie has two characters talk to each other in a hilariously awful exposition dialogue where the one guy tells the other a brief backstory and intel on each of the people picked for a team that they want to use. These are things you'd imagine they'd already know or have communicated through some other means other than their Skype call, but this scene is entirely about telling the viewer ""Here are our these characters and this is their gimmick"".There's no real build-up, there's barely any establishing of characters. We have magical mystics exclaim ""SHAZAM!"" and everything about the movie takes this 100% seriously.Every now and then something has to happen for some convoluted, forced quip that really doesn't fit the situation, from characters who are NOT reacting like they should to absolutely crazy things happening to them.I feel like all of this would be acceptable if the movie didn't take itself so seriously whilst at the same time it tries to mimic other movies. I could tell you exactly what it takes from other movies and why it does that, but that'd be spoilers. No doubt if you've watched all the superhero movies there are you will notice it as well. Some might call it ""homage"", but when every other scene seems to be something like this it becomes derivative.The notion that this movie somehow manages to do ""explorations of morality"" or have any kind of deeper meaning is to me quite laughable.","

The script must be better and tighter to be good comic book action, and they clearly don't understand that.The only person who truly did well in this was the editor who cut the trailer, because she/he truly fooled us into believing that this wasn't absolute and complete trash!I still have 300 characters to use, but why bother. Dwayne Johnson and Danni Garcia should have known better, Aldis Hodge should have known better, and apparently Jaume Collet-Serra the Director, was not ready for comic action hero kind of adventure.

Probably wouldn't recommend to or pay for it like I did, now they've rebooted this would probably be a waste of time to watch for the timeline, DC just doesn't seem to work well in cinema unless it's Batman, consistently trying to copy marvel and failing. A new formula needs to be created for the superhero films to pull people in, this followed the same has powers, gave up powers, got powers back and won. Bit boring.","

Typical character development where the protagonist dislikes everyone in the world but develops a bond with this one random lucky kid but lol. The fight scenes were excellent! Especially his fights with Hawkman. Hawkman is a true brawler. I think they could have done a lot better with Doctor Fate, I would have liked to see him in more fight scenes. Other scenes were a little cliche trying to add humor but it wasn't too bad. Overall decent movie for Rocks debut role in the DC universe.

"crom-dubh","17 December 2022","I am mostly a pretty big fan of Johnson, and I know this was a kind of passion project for him, so despite some superhero fatigue and generally feeling like the DCU films tend to be mediocre at best, I was sort of looking forward to this. What I got was more or less what I probably should have expected: another badly written and tonally uneven CGI extravaganza.The backstory that we're given here feels rushed and muddled, but I still felt some hope that when Black Adam was introduced that things would pick up. In his first real scene you can tell they tried very hard to emphasize the brutality of which he's capable, but they must have overexerted themselves, because the rest of the film feels pretty sanitized by comparison. The marketing and expository dialog all suggests that this is supposed to be darker and morally ambiguous, but it ended up feeling just like more of the same.The actual plot is incredibly clumsy. The conflict that's set up between the Justice Society and Black Adam is forced and legitimately nonsensical. They basically just needed someone for him to fight before the real villain finally shows up, because the ordinary human baddies are obviously no real threat to him. I think the film suffers from having given us no real backstory for any of these characters, because they are uninteresting, hollow, and badly acted. Even Pierce Brosnan doesn't get much to work with here, and the lessons that should have been learned from Wonder Woman about putting an old dude inside a CGI costume went unheeded. Suffice it to say, the Justice Society just ends up being mostly an annoyance here.And speaking of annoying, it's been a while since I've seen a film with more obnoxious expository dialog throughout the entire film that attempts to remind us what the themes are supposed to be. Count how many times they say the word ""hero,"" how many times they mention that Adam ""can't be a hero"" or ""isn't a hero"" blah blah blah. There are so many moments where the film undermines itself by demonstrating that it can't even trust the audience to figure this stuff out for themselves.I'm somewhat generously rating this a 5, and a bit surprised at how positively some people seem to have received this, because it's really very bland. If you've seen even a few of the superhero films in recent years leading up to this, I can't imagine not finding this really predictable and even boring. I hate to say it because Johnson's involvement in a project usually means that it will at least be fun and exciting to watch, but I didn't really feel much of anything watching this.","

Might work 10 years ago but it is so stale now.Dwayne Johnson deserve better. He put in the work but the story just not there. I'm barely following the plot and the supporting characters are not interesting enough for me to care. Sure they have power but they still feel unnecessary. They are just there for some 'cool' scenes. Happy to see Pierce Brosnan but thats about it.Also whats with the kid acting like that other kid in Shazam. The mood of the movie is just all over the place.","

"neill-dunwoody-807-181790","22 October 2022","Sorry it's a Dwayne Johnson oh look at me I'm a big deal movie. It was ok at best, but he should have never been given a stand alone movie, he is an antagonist. He should have featured in Shazam or a Superman movie as the villain. No one in this movie even comes close to his power level until the post credits. The SFX are decent, and Pierce Brosnan is easily the best thing in it. If anything I would probably give him his own stand-alone tv show. The film feels like it should have been realised 15 years ago. It isn't a patch on the MCU or Cristian Bales Batman. Even Thor Love and Thunder was better.Save your money and wait till a quality stream comes out.","

They didn't tailor the role for him and it was not an enjoyable at all to watch.Too much time was spent on the mother and her kid. They were able to fend off mercenaries and supernatural forces without breaking a sweat in order to save the city. They were more annoying than someone you would be rooting for.The story tried to be too grand and relied on CGI to fool the audience. There is very little to characters and as superhero movies goes this was all eye candy.","

Dwayne Johnson will do any movie roll because he's in love with himself more than himself is in love with herself in a loving self after loving himself more than Anyone else has loved him before and then he just loves himself even more after that because the rock is in love with himself soon to be he will marry himself and then divorce himself because he found himself a better himself.","

"craig-snell-151-149427","20 November 2022","But to be fair, that doesn't really make it a fantastic movie. I'd heard/read a lot about Black Adam and I really love Dwayne Johnson when he is playing a decent character.There are some good points to this film, pierce Brosnan was excellent, but he normally is, Hawkman was good as well, and Dwayne did play the role he was given quite well.What I didn't really like about the film had more to to with points that that actors could do very little about, The CGI was very clunky in bits, it seemed to jump through bits and most of the fights appeared to be very jerky as if the editor took out a couple of frames every second, and then thought to himself that no one would notice.There was predictably your paint by numbers superhero movie, feisty mother - check, kid who gets into trouble - check but redeems himself to save the day- check, new hero learning the ropes - check, possible romance between 2 characters down the line - check, I could go on and on, but I got bored writing it, so I'm sure so cannot be bothered to read it.To sum it up, it's good for the DCEU, and meh in the MCU.A lot of people were disappointed with the latest Thor offering, and this movie was a little better than that but it wasn't a patch on Shang-chi,In case you wondered in my humble opinion the other 4 best DCEU movies were (in order)Aquaman
The suicide squad (and it gave us the peacemaker series, which I loved)

Won't remember this movie, there's nothing worth mobilizing a cingle brain cell.Kudos to Pierce Brosnan which was pretty much the only one acting.Dwayne johnson must have 20 lines of text, shouldn't have been too hard for him to memorize...I definitely don't understand how this movie gets so many good reviews and scores, its basically a continous succession of fights, special effects and loud noises. Even michael bay does a better job...I guess they used so much slow mo to make you feel like it's a long movie worth your money. Except its not.","

"demoustierfrancois","3 December 2022","What a let down this movie was. Yes, it's functionnal. But it's not good. Why? Because every single little part has already been seen in the last 10-15 years... In fact, it's a movie for amnesiacs....It's basically a complete rip-off of countless recent superhero movies. It's so painfully obvious, over and over again... it feels like a collection of stolen scenes all rehashed into a new movie that lacks any originality, any personality... I mean, the jet lifting off the opening sport yard outside the mansion. COME ON. Total X-men plagiarism. And it's like that. All. The. Way.I am a big fan of Dwayne Johnson, he is generally so lovable, but even him cannot save this movie, and I'm sad to say that I found him even bad in the role, even though it's most certainly not his fault, but the role which is so badly written!Also, he looks more CGI than human, like he was being (...badly) photoshopped at every second.The whole bunch of completely unknown ""superheroes"" dropping out of nowhere felt so wrong, their proper introduction utterly failed (rip-off of Dr Strange in the Multiverse, and the kleenex team of ""superheroes"" facing Wanda just to die ridiculously? At least those were a decent prop...)Honestly it's the type of movie that makes you think we should really stop paying the slightest attention or giving a single cent to those studios, until they learn to respect their audience, and their staff - I cant believe a director or writer with any notion of self-respect would be content with this... crap... Except maybe Taika Cohen-Waititi...Speaking of which.... After Thor : love and thunder (but Black Adam was not *that* bad...), this was the second really lame superhero movie I've watched this year. I strongly question the future of the genre, the producers seem to be ready to hit rock bottom in their fight for easy and steady profits...I havent seen Black Panther 2 yet, but honestly, such pieces of crap are really poor incentives, making us viewers fear the worst...","

"TheNamelessCzar","12 January 2023","I feel like this movie was made simply to give Dwayne Johnson a role and to use his star power to sell movie tickets. I had never heard of Black Adam before and would do fine if I never heard of him again. First of all, what an awful name for a superhero! The CGI was very artificial in appearance. The characters had no backstory or exposition. How did Black Adam not have an accent earlier in the movie but not later? It all made no sense as characters always ended up being in the right place at the right time with no other extras around. It was as if they were the only people on the planet! Continuous action with little plot. Black Adam needs to go back to sleep.","

The movie was ruined from the start when the rock is playing the same character with the same facial expressions and the same voice and employing no unique perspective required for an ancient super being. It seems like he's just come off the set of FF and is playing the same character despite Black Adam being a million times removed from the FF universe. I wanted to like the movie as I'm a massive superhero fan but it's almost impossible to with his performance and this script. There's no wonder why it's flopping hard and going to make less than the eternals (which sucked and was released during a pandemic) and Shazam. The rock made the budget of this explode and now he's ruined it.","

In fact, the prologue is a great example of what NOT to do--NEVER have voice over by one character at the same time others are speaking in a foreign language that requires subtitles. That's like Editing 101.It's just another anti-hero movie in a long line of superhero movies that neither challenge the genre, nor build upon it in any way. It also came at a time where I personally felt that the market was oversaturated with The Rock (even though I like him).","

Movie Review (11/2022): ""Black Adam"" starring Dwayne Johnson, Pierce Brosnan, and Aldis Hodge.I didn't have much expectation for this DC Comic movie.. but holy cow, what a show!! It's an adventure/super hero type of movie with a ton of action. Johnson was great.. but Pierce Brosnan was awesome in his role as Dr. Fate. It's a cool movie because it's set in another land, but also starts in a different time. It's such an interesting movie because it just feels like it covers numerous genres of films.Acting was very good.. and no shortage of action.I'd give this a solid 7 out of 10 starts. Definitely a BIG screen movie!! See it on the big screen because it's visually exciting and deserves to be ""experienced""!While some people seem to rate a very good movie a 10 on IMDB (which always makes me wonder what a REAL film classic is if a movie like this is a 10), a 7 in my book is a very high rating. This is definitely worth seeing!!","

"dorMancyx","24 October 2022","It's commercial action superhero movie time, which means don't take your brain to the theater! Ignore the ethics, ignore the logistics, just shut up and hype.Everything, I mean literally everything in the film, works up for the nonstop action sequences, which in themselves are absolutely mesmerizing, incredibly cinematic, and visibly money-burning. By employing slow motions, explosions, imaginative cinematography, plus the support of great costumes, choreography, and environmental layout, the movie captures the entirety of Black Adam's strength, speed, and brutality, as well as the specialties of other characters. Though the audience was acquainted with Shazam's identical abilities. Black Adam takes it to a higher level, as I legit climaxed (mentally) seeing the caped figure snatches the mercenary by his neck and melts him down to skeleton like ice cream. However, with the huge emphasis on action sequences, the film sacrifices a decent storyline, character dynamics, and essential moral, for even the short transitions are filled with dialogues that foreshadow the next combat. A lot more regarding anti-heroism, anti-fate, and anti-oppression could be exploited if the action sequences are of a fewer fraction. Demolishing the throne is indeed a forceful symbolism, but in-depth reasons are lacking.And if we're talking about Black Adam, we cannot avoid the actor that portrays it. Who else could present such muscular, semi-stern, semi-comic while extremely charismatic macho man other than Dwayne Johnson? Although his only expression are either ""dead serious looking at some distant statues"" or ""face twisted, yelling, teeth flared to show struggling"", the Rock performs his best at this level of a movie. My only complaint is that his suit looks too tight comparing to his big, fat, bald, rectangular head that seems humongous in the numerous close-ups.Anyway, definitely a thrilling superhero movie, and I look forward to having DCEU finally coming together.","

"OldMovieRob","17 February 2023","This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Bad enough that I got an hour into it and had to stop, for some very basic reasons: I didn't care about anyone in the film, namely the protagonist Black Adam (played by pro wrestler The Rock) who basically spends the entire film glaring and looking annoyed. The supporting crew? Who cares? And who on earth are the JSA? Are they like the Great Value Justice League? There was a glimmer of potential with the characters Hawkman and Doctor Fate, both of whom seemed like they could have been interesting characters to get to know, but the problem is, so much is going on, you don't get to really know any of these characters and you don't care about any of them. And what's the deal with the strange country in the desert where everything is cyan and orange, and how when a big bald flying guy shows up and destroys a few things, they all instantly think he's a hero. How did that happen so quickly? Wouldn't this take time to establish a hero narrative like that? The only positive, and the only reason I gave this turkey 2-stars instead of 1, was the post credit scene with Cavill as Superman, along with a few notes of the John Williams' motif. That alone was worthy of a star. The rest of the film, however, was hot garbage.","

The Rock is quite serious in this - I was expecting a very goofy Rocky (or Dwayne Johnson if that is what you want to call him).But then again I was not really expecting anything much from the rest of the film. I know I was completely wrong about the role played by Pierce Brosnan. Having said that I did not watch the trailer, I did not read anything about the movie ... although I did watch the Interview The Rock gave Jimmy Fallon ... and well I was ""prepared"" for the mid credit scene ... which felt almost like a disappointment to me. But that's a different story - well same story, but let's not really dive into that. And there is diving, but that is ... ok back to the movie but without any specifics, shall we? Rhetorical, please don't answer.The cast is a delight, the movie overall is quite serious - misses a few beats and jokes to say the least. And some jokes are just plain bad. A few work quite well though - sometimes the editing does not leave them enough space to breathe.The effects are ok, the story is overall predictable though. Even if you have not read anything about it. Also it uses tropes and cliches that may make you cringe at times ... by the way the plan of the human ""heroes"" is quite ... I am not sure if calling it bad would do it justice! Find something and then ... well nothing ... but as the movie tries to tell us: bad plans are better than no plans at all ... though there is no need to rush ... and there is no need to have ... I reckon I should go out and take breathe ... so many puns ... anyway, suspend your disbelief and it can work wonders. And this having a high score is quite the wonder ... Shazam indeed.","

"Thanos_Alfie","21 February 2023","""Black Adam"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a man with some extraordinary powers being freed from his tomb after 5,000 years. Soon enough he will seek revenge and justice in the modern world.I liked this movie but I have to say that I expected more from it. The plot was simple but interesting and it contained plenty of action that was well combined with mystery. The direction which was made by Jaume Collet-Serra was simple and did not make the difference although he presented very well his main characters and explained equally good the plot of the movie. The interpretations of Dwayne Johnson who played as Black Adam, Pierce Brosnan who played as Dr. Fate, Aldis Hodge who played as Hawkman and Noah Centineo who played as Atom Smasher were very good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Black Adam"" is a nice action movie but I expected more in terms of visual effects and direction.","

Hope we get to see Zack Snyder's version come in active form.It looks promising so far.The movie is highly recommended to DC fans who are interested in seeing now developments that promise more action to come.Thanks, The Rock!","

I felt my eyes closing a few times during this film, so that is never a good sign as I never fall asleep during movies, especially not ones that are supposed to be action orientated!The problem with all the superhero movies these days, is that the writers and directors are making them all - the same. All the heroes seem to have the same un godly powers, super strength, can fly, bullets bounce off them. It's boring. It's tiring. Clearly Superman has rubbed off on every other wannabe hero. And all the B-grade heroes they chuck in on the sidelines just make it worse - Hawkman/hawk guy, the girl who is a tornado or a cyclone or whatever and the dude who grows, I thought I was watching Marvel's Ant-Man again. It feels, meh. I can't even remember the names of their characters and I don't care about them either.Come on DC - you don't have to try copy Marvel. The reason Nolan's Batman films (and even the most recent Batman) were so good, is that there was a story that was properly built and executed and I loved them. The action scenes were then really appreciated. It wasn't just exploding buildings every 3 seconds.","

"cinistersynthicate","21 October 2022","Without question this may very well be the second worst DC film for me, next to 2017 Justice League. For a project that has been over a decade in the making The Rock surely could've campaigned for a better director. Black Adam is one of the most bland comic book movies in years. For a movie that the rock swears is not trying to copy marvel the film does a whole lot of exactly that. The JSA's film debut is sadly not reliant on its wide spanning, fantastic source material and instead is treated like a discount X-men all lead by the one-toned Dwayne Johnson. For someone who was never a fan of the rock to begin with, I tried hard to clear my mind and be unbiased but the rock continues to only play the rock but in a cool costume, there is no feeling of a character being played on screen. The film continues to have this filter to it that does not fit and tries incredibly hard to be hardcore and 'Cool' but comes off by being as cool as flipping your jacket collar up while wearing sunglasses inside. Brosnan's Doctor Fate was without question the thing I looked forward to most when I went into this and this script did him absolutely no good, with dialogue and banter coming off at a CW level of cheap. In conclusion, this movie was made purely by Dwayne Johnson for Dwayne Johnson, it was made cheaply by a throwaway director who would toot the Rocks horn, and the studio just threw it out there to hope audiences would buy into this nonsense, Which clearly it wasn't working which is why in the final press cycle they had to reveal the post credit scene to attract people. Wait for streaming or something.","

All 2 hours long.The opening sequence, while it would have had some decent shots, if the camera didn't move that much.. is made worse by poor storytelling.I don't blame the person telling the story.The score of the movie has excellent songs.Hal Hartley, David Lynch , and movie student Tarantino are aware of the power of the right song at the right time.Here they are not the right song. But just music at random times really that sort of takeover how long the scene lasts...
Not the movie, not the story, just something random determines the length of a scene.The folks at Roger egbert. Once a respectable reviewsite of movies has watered down to influences wannabees.Often they rate movies according to box office.This makes sense from an influencer standpoint. They give what the masses want.I however I want to read about an Indonesian thriller that now got a small release. If it's bad than it's bad if it's good I want to hear about it.Or other obscure stuff that makes you excited to see.Not about why the box office movies are great.The same can be said about series.Series like squid game are all over the place. Giving it praise sometimes in places were it doesn't deserve praise.A series like sky castle goes mostly unnoticed.ALL OF US ARE DEAD , which actually is quite okay, gets way more attention than Kingdom which is at the top in it's genre.HOWEVER,
there is almost no way in finding that out unless you watch, watch till your eyes bleed.Dwayne Johnson got lauded for his acting at R. E.'s site.Uhm I think he is a good fit for the role. But I don't know if I would call it high level acting.ACTUALLY very little acting is required because of all the action scenes. And him lighting up well it is special effects...if standing or flying in a shot is acting looking at the back at your head, well than clearly I am missing something.I am aware that I have given a lot of 1's lately and honestly it bugs me.So I'll take a break from the box office and try to catch up on independent releases on bluray in 2023.I recently snagged up some anime series and honestly they are way better at keeping my attention and I am more often delighted watching them than frustrated.Because honestly I am frustrated that this movie was made .","

For example, there's a moment where he is addressing a large crowd during a chaotic point of the movie, he seems like he's whispering, and had no intensity in his body which wouldn't fit the scenario at all.I truly wanted to like this film, but there are several moments I just groaned in disappointment, paused the movie just to walk away for an hour or a day.

"PartTimeCritic","26 February 2023","BLACK ADAM (C) is a bit of a dizzying viewing as it begins with a prologue explaining a brand new pre-history for the DC cinematic universe - one that is complicated with all the stuff introduced from the Snyder cut of Justice League. Black Adam, played by Dwayne Johnson, is introduced as a superhero (connected with the film Shazam in ways I don't remember from that one) that essentially is Superman, except he chooses to use his powers for revenge and he is imprisoned by a powerful wizard council. Anyways, in modern DCU the modern city of Khandaq, built on that ancient city, is being oppressed and they are able to bring back Black Adam to liberate them. It gets complicated as there is a demon crown involved, an intergang authority, and Amanda Waller calls on a Justice Society (kind of like a Justice League or Suicide but good) to go and capture Black Adam. Essentially, the arc for Black Adam is that power isn't to be used for revenge, but for the good of others. It's the same message we got from the very first superhero breakthrough in Sam Raimi's Spiderman - with great powers come great responsibility. I felt serious superhero fatigue in this one with the amount of new lore, powers, and characters they throw at you. I'm sure the background in the comics is complicated, but the way it has played out in the movie makes Dr. Fate feel like a knock off Dr. Strange, Atom Smasher a knock off Ant-Man, and Hawk Man a knock off Falcon. Black Adam for most of the film is just Dwayne looking stern and serious, there's just not much charisma there to be honest. Despite tons of expensive CGI and handsome production values, everything here feels tired, extraneous, and obligatory. If the film had come out on the front end of the superhero trend I think it would be received better. By the time the big showdown with the Armageddon bad guy happens and an apocalyptic demon army arises, I just wanted it to be over.","

"RonnieCrown","24 November 2022","As a certified Marvel fan, I have never been overly impressed by DC. I decided to give this a watch out of sheer boredom and I was extremely surprised. The film was really good.Action-packed throughout, so I never had a chance to get bored. The CGI was pretty good, and even the humour injected into scenes were as intended - funny (but thankfully without being corny).Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam was believable and executed perfectly. I didn't know anything about the character Black Adam prior to watching, but I really liked him! Probably because he has qualities like me: No nonsense, straight talking and just wants to get on with it and get the job done. Even so, I would've liked to see just a tad more personality which was lacking.Although the story could've taken more risk and lacked some depth it was entertaining and fast-paced.Overall a decent superhero film.","

"genham","26 November 2022","Why does the rock insist on making these poor films. If they gave this story more thought and tried to create a realistic version of a comic book with good character development, great origin story that makes sense and characters not doing stupid things. It's a film made for children. I'm a big fan of comic books but when translated into a film they need to consider adults and what we might find intriguing and intelligent. This is just nonsense. He has the potential to do great acting. Ballers was brilliant. He needs to generate adult intelligent films if he wants to step up his film career. Maybe stick to good series rather than films. You don't care about anyone in this film. Acting is average. Story poor. Nothing creative. Poor origin story. Nothing very deep. A film I've seen a hundred times before designed for 7 year olds.","

"Rasalgheti_2000","21 October 2022","This could have been another generic superhero movie, or The Rock movie for that matter, full of over-the-top special effects, inhumane situations, and finally a boring and tedious movie, but somehow the script, the director and the actors manage to give us an entertaining story, to some extent fresh and above all with an important background message: what is justice? What is revenge? What is the difference between both? Can a hero become a villain? Can a villain become a hero? What is the motivation behind the actions you do? Really a great movie that puts DC / Warner on the map again with great force. I can only hope that it does well at the box office. All of you who haven't seen it yet, don't listen to the critics on Rotten Tomatoes or other similar sites. Those guys don't know shit!","

"trwbxcpr","20 October 2022","I went expecting something original and exciting, instead I had 2 hours of vague memories and predictable outcomes. It was a patchwork quilt made from every other superhero movie ever made but resulting in a Green Lantern style failure. From slippery Skateboarding brat antagonising the bad guys trying to look super edgy to cringe attempts at subtle humour Drax style that missed the mark. Cyclone was a waste of a character, her wind was colourful though. Pearce tried & was probably the only thing that came close to worth watching. There was little story, less character development and no genuine nemesis until the last 20 minutes, just a poor attempt at creating animosity and conflicts of conscience between the good guys and the predictably soon to be hero. Not one WOW moment, not one moment of tension. My Choc Top was the most enjoyable part of the movie.","

"imdb-ikysmoviedatabase","21 October 2022","I only watched the trailer of the movie last week. It didn't look like something to be really excited about but I still thought I'd give it a watch. And I managed to watch it on the first show in the local cinema in uk.The opening looked really good with great looking visuals. Action scenes were okay. It keeps switching between fast and slow-motion matrix style action. It partly made me think I'm watching a computer game on the big screen. Black adam has alot of flash lighting, as shown in the trailer, which was a bit annoying, but that's what the films all about with tech adam having God's powers.The story is average nothing special.Five thousand years ago, the city of Kahndaq was under the tyrannical rule of king Anh-Kot, who intended to create the Crown of Sabbac, which is known to give the wearer great power. After enslaving his people and forcing them to dig for ""Eternium"" - the magical crystal needed to create the crown - a young boy leads the slaves to revolt against him. When the boy is given the power of Shazam, transforming him into Kahndaq's heroic champion Teth-Adam, he kills Anh-Kot and ends his reign. So that's the opening before black adam wakes up in the present time, and the action really takes off.The movie keeps slowing down and in the end I felt as if it's really dragging. Over all it is an average movie. I'd say it's only a one time watch.Dwayne Johnson did fine playing black adam cause no acting skills were required for the role. He looked in great shape as always, but no wwe the rock gimmick is used here from him.Therer were only about 5 people watching the film in the first showing of the day. And all weekend occupancy of pre-booking is really bad for a big budget dc movie. Runtime is 2h 4 minutes so not to long without the ads.","

"acinemafan","27 December 2022","Dwayne Johnson has a lot of charisma, as exemplified in movies like ""The Jungle Cruise,"" and the ""Jumanji"" movies (he has a great sense of humor). His weakness appears to be dramatic acting (no a scowl is not considered acting).Now, Johnson's shortcomings may have been due to the director not directing him, because the rest of the film is bad, as well. It looks like it looks like it was made for the WB network, where you find those superhero shows in which everything is beautiful - including the cast.A man whose been resurrected after a thousand years, appears to be adjusting quite well. Wow. The quote between Hawkman and Tech-Adam that is shared by this very site is cringe worthy.","

"arficus","25 November 2022","This was hard to watch. I might expect action sequences to strain the bounds of credulity in such a film, but the dialogue? Wooden, nonsensical at times. Not any kind of nonsensical that adds anything, but just inane - writing so poor that it can't track the logical coherence between character, setting, and voice. It helped to remind myself that this was part of a comic book franchise.I'll sometimes watch such flicks just for the visual entertainment, eg The CGI. This film let me down in that department as well. Lots of high speed action that looked very cartoon like and flat. The morphing figures frequently reminded me of action sequences from popular cartoons of the 1930s such as Pluto and Mickey Mouse.If you're not already a fan of DC comic universe films (or whatever they're called) then definitely avoid. If you are a fan, please disregard what I've written and rock on.","

"kaskhan78","23 December 2022","First thing first. This movies should be taught in acting school how not to act. I mean the worst acting by the lead roles especially Sarah Shahi and the Aldis Hodge and we already know Dwayne Johnson can't act.Just for the sake of diversity this movie has all the bad actors of different color and it's coming from a person of color.I don't understand Hollywood new obsession with the accents, I mean the accents used in it made the movie even worst to the point of unbearable.I understand the people's obsession with super heros but to make a movie just for the sake of pleasing few is not a good idea.The humor in the movie was worst than middle school comedian.Try next time with better story, better actor and better accents.","

"BestBenedikt","20 November 2022","How can a 200 million dollar movie look this ugly? Every shot looks fake, every action sequence like straight out of Tarsem Singh's IMMORTALS, just with less style to it.Besides some weird exposition, there is almost no story to be found here - just lazy MacGuffin chasing as a framework for the most untasteful CGI extravaganza that makes you feel like experiencing a migraine aura. And if BLACK ADAM's dialogue doesn't manage to kill of your brain cells, I don't know what will.The context this movie chooses to localise itself in is also odd to say the least: a fictional country named Kahndaq, basically an americanized version of Iraq, occupied by ""international mercenaries"" - with a kid on his skateboard telling one of the evil occupiers that they are ""stealing our resources, suppressing our heritage"" within the first few minutes. That's strangely ideological and vague for the sake of being applicable to global audiences at the same time.I guess Pierce Brosnan is the only bright spot in this seizure-inducing schlock. And I still don't get why they won't just say ""Shazam!"" all the time.","

"SamfurinMinklefists","25 November 2022","Black Adam is such a bad movie, started watching last night had to turn it off. After composing myself, I started it again the next day, unfortunately it does not get better!The dialog is confusing, cringy and feels rushed. The music score felt cold and repetitive and had this non-stop false sense of foreboding. I understand what they were trying to do with the story but those intended 'emotional moments' just miss due to the lack of character development, something that can only be achieved through multi year/multi project films.I honestly don't know where the almost $200 million budget went, but I can tell you Warner Bros./DC need to step their CGI/Green Screen game up to ILM level. Thats where the bar is now.","

These types of movies are supposed to be fun escapism but this one just left me bored and sleepy. It takes itself too seriously. Hollywood needs to realise that it's audience has changed. We have seen these kinds of movies over and over. Now we expect more. Give us better character development, give us complex multifaceted characters. Also the non stop cliches are what makes this movie so uninspired. I thought DC was making a comeback with wonderwoman 1 and the newest suicide squad with giant starfish but unfortunately this is 10 steps back.","

"pensacolacomputer","22 October 2022","Well, they tried to something different I guess, but man this was really really disappointing.First the acting is not good. The Rock is dull at best. Sorry but he is a good wrestler but a bad actor. And where is his accent? Hes not suppose to have an American accent, but he does. Just more proof that he is not a good actor.Second issue is the story. It jumps around way too much. But on top of that its not that interesting. Sorry, I wanted to like it, I tried to like it ,but in the end, I just couldn'tThey screened this movie and it got the same score from people that Batgirl did, but that was canceled, so they probably should have done the same with this one too.2/10 - Not good.","

No character development, no wise cracks from the Rock and a lack of a good story. Warner Brothers, please stop trying to be Marvel. Be more Richard Donner, Christopher Nolan, tell a story give the audience a reason to hate and love characters. Don't rely on effects, I felt like I was watching a really bad version of Transformers!! I didn't even watch this at the movies, because I had already heard the ending credits were better than the film and I love going to the movies. Bring us better or don't bring nothing at all.","

Both my husband and myself felt that it was such a waste of money towards Marvel rubbish futuristic green screen movies. They lack a plot, looks like Dwayne is wearing half a dress and pants and can't act to save his life. He used to stand for a bit of comedy and a good laugh. Lockdown must have cooked his acting skills, quite clear from the dribble he tweeted during lockdown that put me right off him & I used to be a fan.","

Else, i found everything to be unrealistic. Though there is an effort to define the characters, does not look convincing.So is the story line. Waited till the end only to have this question.Why was this movie made ? Why did i even want to see it !!I guess the answer to it is, the makers forcing themselves to have a super hero. Now it can be argued if the super hero is for the audience or for the producers to take them to the bank ;)All in all a movie that should be skipped.","

"lord_orsum","23 October 2022","First and foremost, I am a Marvel fan, but Black Adam is by far a better film than either Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness or Thor: Love and Thunder (the latter being the MCUs worst film to date).After more than a decade of wonderful MCU films, they have recently lost their way, with too much comedy and not enough drama or peril. Conversely, DC has spent a decade struggling to find the right balance of light and dark (tending too much to the latter), and their recent films have started to get that right (with the exception of the truly awful Wonder Woman 1984).Black Adam benefits from Dwayne Johnson's not inconsiderable charisma, and Pierce Brosnan brings some quality acting to a cast that seriously needs it.The plot is fairly standard and predictable, occasionally let down by some truly stupid decisions by the ""heroes"" (for example, when meeting a 5000-year-old super-being, who got his powers freeing his oppressed people, why would the first thing you say to them is to demand that they surrender and bend their knee to you?!?!?)The story occasionally touches on important questions, especially the one about a country that has been oppressed for years, yet no superhero has showed up until Black Adam appears. I would like to have seen this blatant hypocrisy more explored by the heroes, questioning what good they are actually doing in the world, and who they are actually helping.Well done DC; it took you long enough, but you got there in the end!","

The effects are good but that does not save the really silly things that happened. I had the feeling that I was watching a bad copy from Marvel. One mix of Daredevil-Antman-Spider-Man was there, then we had the Doctor...strange, the other one with the wings etc.No Humor, nothing was evolved with the characters. Nothing happens!Felt like they Filmed it in a week.They really did not had to say something new.And the film were better for direkt online streaming and not cinema.Sad but it does not worth it.","

Where action scenes are pretty good, full of explosions and superpowers the rest of this film is a total mess. The plot develops very quickly without allowing the main character to catch up so the whole thing is rushed and very cheesy. This could have easily been done so much better and smoother. I guess they wanted the anti hero to become a hero very quickly so they rushed through the plot and re-wrote his true nature as they pleased. It's a mess. Watch it for a silly movie night but considering I rewatched Zach Snyder's 4 hour justice league cut last night I can assure you this is a badly written action packed mess.","

The worst character was definatly hawkman.I think the people saying this is great are either getting paid or are teens who like any superhero nonsense. The superhero genre seems to be going downhill since that last avengers film, which was great,but i think that hit the peak of things, and now its all been downhill.

Because it has ""The Rock"" in it, I allowed my expectations to rise.Sadly, this was an overlong, terribly written snoozefest. All the fight scenes are overly dramatic, with too many slow motion interjections and way overdone CGI. The story lacks any reason to care about the characters or coherency. The dialogue and character interaction is simply terrible (even the actors seem incredibly bored with it).When a character dies, and you don't feel any empathy or care it is a reflection of terrible writing. This movie has plenty of that.All in all, a waste of time and money.","

It lacked soul and purpose other than to further bury DC movies.Even the action scenes are a let down. Yeah lots of CGI and explosions but there is no gravity to them, you don't care who dies or why. Some are gruesome but even then just in a very clinical manner.There was no one character I cared about, good or bad. After 40 minutes I was done.In the end all that can be said is there is not just no reason to watch this, there was no reason for it to be made. Maybe a decade this would have been OK but there is so much of this stuff, that something this bland was bound to fail.

It's all just references as well, going ad far as to compare a stand-off with ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" to a meaningless scene theta takes place literally 5 minutes later. The visual effects are pretty awful too. I'll say it again; this movie is loud, headache-inducing loud.

Since he is an archeologists in the comics, it couldve meshed really well if he found him and tried to guide to be a hero. Another missed opportunity. However, hawkman and dr.fate saved the movie. The fight scenes and cinematography were great tho. And why have child actors been so horrid lately? The little boy was terrible. Ik they couldve found someone better. I enjoyed it but it just felt hollow. The soundtrack was pretty awesome tho. Kids will love this movie tho, but if youre an honest movie critic, youll tear it apart.","

"veritybingo","18 November 2022","The story had the potential of a grand epic, but... once again we are given yet another tie-in to an existing franchise where everyone is blasé about gods & superheroes, like so what, we've seen it all before. This is not storytelling. It seems this 'film' was engineered by and intended for gamers.The effects pretty much inspire no awe, the script is bland and unoriginal, the acting is unbelievably dull.. Though Dwayne does look the part and has successfully avoided bringing his comedy brain to work as he should.The only entertaining character is Kamir (Mo Amer) who seems to have been written by somebody else and has the only identifiable trace of personality in the film whatsoever.","

"jarkko-15938","16 December 2022","I have enjoyed a lot of this genre movie in the past. But to be honest..this movie has nothing to say, all it is is special effects by a computer..and not so great ones. I think that the producers knew this and for all that in mind they decided that they should use Dwayne Johnson as a Lead caracter..boy were they wrong. D can only carry for so far..And another think I'd like to put out is the special effects..those are not you would see in a movie like, for example, in Avatar..it is like a ten year ole made teen. I wanted to like it..but this one I had to skip more than one scene🙄 But hey..you have to see it to believe it!","

"rjgrund-123-603438","17 December 2022","After all the hype and promotion I was expecting so much more than this mess. If this was the Rock's passion project I would hate to see what it would have been if it wasn't. The script was weak and the characters one dimensional. The secondary characters were cartoonish. Whoever wrote this had no clue how to write a superhero film. All they had to do was watch some Marvel movies. The casting left a lot to be desired. Outside of Dwayne Johnson it looked like everyone was phoning their performances in. The editing and effects were not on par with the type of film this desired to be. And the director had no clue what he was doing most of the time. Another bad choice in my opinion.From the beginning it was off to a bad start with the voice over background story that could have been told later, and was, in brief shots. The first ten minutes were unnecessary. Cut another 20 minutes and this film would have flowed better. And then there is the Henry Cahill Superman cameo at the end to remind us of that mess. And to think that's the last time we will see Cavill's Superman. I can see why this film didn't make money. No one wanted to see it twice. Even for free I know I don't.","

"lucaslunt","29 October 2022","Awesome movie!! Great action and doesn't succumb to the ""woke"" movement that have destroyed movies for the past 2 years. Don't listen to the critics, probably one of DC's top films and the audience score really shows it.If you want excellent action, decent story, and nothing to do with Hollywood politics trying to push some dumb point down your throats than watch Black Adam. I beg everyone to rate this movie high so that DC/Marvel/Sony and any other superhero/sci-fi studio realizes that what we want is bad ass action, amazing characters, good story, and to stop ruining our beloved movies by trying to be ""woke"". We're already aware of such subjects from our everyday life and movies are meant to be entertainment.","

"phantomkrome","20 October 2022","Honestly felt like the whole marketing campaign was super overdone and filled with a lot more lies that what other movies do. It's a very messy movie and struggles to find a purpose and decent end goal, the story is very very weak and Black Adam's character is EXTREMELY plain and one dimensional, no character development. JSA was such a wasted potential especially with a solid cast. Hawkman and Dr Fate out shine Atom Smasher and Cyclone but are but even then these characters are not well written. Hawkman becomes the good character that never agrees with the main character and always wants to fight him (very cliché). Visuals were 7/10 but the direction ruined it for me, the director definitely tired a lot of what Snyder did in MoS and ZSJL but with a dollar store level of execution. Everything in this movie feels forced. Black Adam's emotional backstory, his people's champions thing and even the final credits scene, all feels like it was squeezed in. Felt like they had like 2-3 major ideas and everything else was forced in. In terms of the general action, it's actually not bad, again very much inspired by what Snyder does with poor execution. The intro fight was actually very good and the Black Adam escapes scene was great as well but the rest of the movie had pretty terrible action, especially the 3rd act, except for the Dr Fates fight scenes in the 3rd act, I thought it was pretty good, but definitely could have improved on it significantly with a few tweaks, this again goes back to weak screenplay and direction. Also I hate the weird Hollywood Mexico colour grading/filter, everything was all yellowish and I hate when Hollywood movies do that, usually DC refrained from this but this was a terrible choice.Overall it isn't a terrible movie and probably is good enough to be a 7/10 but I think for most people it's gonna be a 5/10 and honestly the 6/10 is for the TERRIBLE marketing scheme and completely misguiding the audience. I don't believe The Rocks gonna save DC, not until I see better results. I think everything he did was just a massive promotion for the movie. Especially the post credit scene, it was 100% a later addition just to get more audience.","

It is perfectly balanced with the Shazam world and is a perfect homage to Zack Snyder's way of DCEU. The kid IN THE MOVIE will win your heart. Be prepared to get goosebumps. Dr. Fate is a character everyone would fall for. Cyclone and Atom Smasher did justice to the portrayal. Dwayne at his best caliber carried the entire movie on his shoulders. The BGM is awesome. This is an outstandingly entertaining film. Keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. Critics definitely went too far in criticism.","

"capitanotm","19 October 2022","First i must say Rock is perfect for this role, just like Cavil is for Superman.Story is good, depth is decent, humor is sometimes just so-so, but mostly it has great effect and builds really strong impression of that aspect of the movie.My problem is with the finally fight as black adam was not able to defeat the bad guy alone, or he didnt even have any time to do it, since it ended pretty fast, but with the help of the flying guy. So i am the of those who really hate when main badass needs help, as movies before and during me growing up were so that badass guy always wins and that is how it is supposed to be, not always needing teams, especially in kinda standalone movies like this.Effects 10/10, humor mostly 9/10, story 7/10, finally fight 4.5/10.But firmly looking forward for movie with black adam and superman hoping to see that amazing fight on big screens, to see if movie makers will be as books were black adam is the most powerful of all!","

"trumpisafatpileofshit","29 December 2022","Black Adam... more like Whack Shat-am! So yes, there is a lot of action, and super powers, and advanced tech, an ancient tech, but it doesn't make up for the poor story writing. There's a lot of over used tropes and unnecessary moments who's sole purpose is to force the story along, and this is because they didn't do a good enough job writing (or maybe were too lazy). There are the scenes that seem cringy and redundant, but without them they would have no way to tie this jumble of action sequences together. A better writer (or even a mediocre novice writer) would connect these moments with ""therefore"" or ""but"", but this whole movie seems connected by ""and then"". They wrote the big budget prerequisite Hollywood action sequences and filled the story in after.Now, let's talk about how many times they chose to rip off Marvel. Was it to try and draw marvel fans in with familiarity? Was it to trick you into thinking it was good by the tying your memories to better movies? Was it because they're trying to hop on a stylized bandwagon? Yes to all. I won't expose all the rips, because I didn't care enough to count. The most obvious ones are:Their jet coming out of the underground hanger at a mansion and the jet's shape is completely ripped from The X-Men.The atom rearranger guy is a rip off of AntMan. And while I don't know who came first in the comic world, I can tell you that Ant Man has always been more famous, and the fact the he's been in at least 5 Marvel movies means DC should have picked a character with different, more unique powers for this.This atom rearranger guy's mask is completely ripped off of the design of Deadpool's. The same tight leather with flat white eyes. There's a million ways to construct a mask that is based on a drawing, and countless materials. They specifically chose these to piggyback on the love for and success of Deadpool.The chose a character who reminds us of Storm, and a character that is similar to falcon. During the first introductions, they surround this Hawkman character with super advanced technology and dress him if traditional African patters and colors. This is to tie him to the success of Black Panther, an so you remember how much you loved that movie while watching this steamer.Not a marvel reference but they make the van look like the Mystery Machine from Scooby Doo.There are many more but I'm already bored. I do think Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has jumped the shark on this one. His acting and characters are always the same, his movies are all slices of cheese, but they've always been a good time. I did not enjoy myself watching this and it made me hyper-focused on the fact that The Rock doesn't actually act. He just says lines and has muscles. If he can act, then so can I, and so can a bucket of paint.DC needs to quit while they're behind... their movies are behind... their movies are butt.","

It has little to no redeeming qualities - it wasted Pierce Brosnan. It wasted Quintessa Swindell. It really, really, wasted Dwayne Johnson whose personality was hidden beneath layers of tedious characterisation which was trying to head down the T2 route but ended up missing the target quite badly.The DCEU needs a serious review. Only Shazaam is any good, every other entry being a turgid mess and I had high hopes for this but they got the tone so badly wrong, no-one in the screening I attended knew when to chuckle or when not to.Bad.","

"jeanvieve7","17 December 2022","Am I one of the few that think this film is a hot mess?We have gotten to a point in films where visual effects are a given!! Movies in this genre are now cranked out on a conveyer belt rather than being the rare treat that began the trend in 2008. Now they are made by being plumped up with so much visual stimuli, computer generated effects, canned dialogue, and quick back stories (as ploy to delve into present-day action)... we seem to not even notice lack of character development or actual story.Black Adam could be a poster child for the aforementioned formula. There are no bad actors in this film. They simply are not given A good script to work with, or any character to develop or substance to get their teeth into.It's a tough one because I like Dwayne Johnson. I like Pierce Brosnan, I even like and enjoy some of the more minor characters in this film including Sarah Shahi and Aldis Hodge. But they are utterly wasted in this film. I feel like this movie was so quick to get into action that everything else was an afterthought....a quick throwaway backstory, throw in some characters which were completely cliché and steriotyped into villains, antihero's, and oppressed (etc), there was simply no thought into creating any kind of depth or originality.This movie is pure formula. The type of film that you could have plugged in some algorithms and classic clichés from superhero movies into an AI, and have it write a script for you.I'm glad I'm writing this right after watching the movie. Because I'm sure by tomorrow I will have forgotten it.","

Think Samaritan or the first Captain America movie rather than an epic superhero romp.Side characters come and go with no consequence, the audience stand in androgynous teen becomes a driving plot point for no reason I could work out and the attempts to humanise Adam and turn him from ""all powerful destroyer"" into ""oh okay we're basically superman now"" are a little jarring but hey, some JLA characters turn up, new Hawkman is cool and Dr Fate portrayed by Pierce Brosnan is excellent so it's not all bad.Solid 6/10 superhero action, not as good as Watchmen, The Batman or the majority of Marvel films, but perfectly watchable.","

I watched the movie because Dwayne Johnson is charismatic and funny. Sadly DC/Warner Studios made their move again. One more time the plot was turned into real bad decisions that disappointed the fans (who are the first ones in queue for the movies). Black Adam character was well played, serious, scary, dreaded and merciless or mostly. Great FX aren't enough although its importance in this kind of movie.I applaud Dwayne Johnson whose performance was great, but the movie is not that good and I´m really sorry to say that.DC/Warner please! There are hundreds of thousands of super awesome plots into the comics PLEASE! Work into and fine adaptation of those plots that fans and not fans will love alike.

There is no character depth and there is no supporting characters worth anything. You could say Dr Fate is the exception and I won't argue with that.. Pierce Brosnan did the best he could and that turned out to be better than this movie deserved. Everything else is a shallow idiotic CGI-fest. They absolutely miscast Hawkman by the way. The Rock maybe drawing some praise from the minority but the majority of people who saw this movie say it's ridiculous.

"olafpiers","18 December 2022","As per ""tradition"", every DC movie of the past year introduces way too many characters with way too little backstory set against a predictable storyline that features a guy/girl in a cape who is too strong for their own good. Black Adam is no different.Besides Black Adam, we are introduced to 4 new heroes and their ""boss"", but after 2 hours I still have no idea who's who and what their relationship is. Some characters seem to be there for emotional context or comic relief, but as they are not properly introduced, they failed to deliver any emotional response from me.Although the character Black Adam is refreshing in its brutality, his arc and the storyline of the overall movie are boringly predictiable. Take the plot of any superhero movie (especially DC) and you've got the plot of Black Adam. The main cast do a good job at portraying the characters, but the writers and editors seem simply lazy.","

It sounded like a 3rd grade was reading from a textbook. And the acting for goodness sake, mediocre at best. No wonder you had to use those actors, its the only way for Dwane Johnson to shine in this movie for his acting skills. Dreadful. At least in my point of view DC had a good going for their first suicide squad movie and then flopped with their 2nd movie. And this Black Adam now? Hell no. There was no character build up, just CGI flashing all over the places. And c'mon, it took 5000 years for someone to find the crown while knowing where it exactly is? There would be government people all over the place for it. Good thing I saved my money not watching is in the cinema, couldn't even stand 1 hour into the movie. Garbage.","

Which there is nothing wrong with but I definitely had my hopes up that this would be more like the feel of the dark night series or even the Superman's.The storyline really didn't make any sense in the fact that in order to use the crown's powers he had to have black Adam kill him? Yet he didn't even know that was black adams tomb in the beginning? After he got the crown was he than supposed to find black Adam if they didn't release him in the beginning? I don't know, I feel like someone could have easily made up a way better storyline than how it was. Also the fact that the whole movie took place in one day was terrible.The acting was pretty bad but that's the fault of the character choices. The teenage characters from justice league and the kid ruined the movie for me. Again reverts back to this just being a kids movie.So all and all super underwhelming just like the Hercules movie.

Some parts with the kid on the skate board could've also be cut out.. unnecessary.Overall it was a good watch, so recommend to see it and it will be good to see if there's a follow up to the ending.","

Either the studio heads forced them in or the writers were unable to connect the story together without them... But it would have been so much better if they were written out, and would have cut at least 30 minutes of dead weight out of this movie.While there are other issues in the film, it would have made everything far more bearable.With them you have this super powerful character, who is admittedly not good, giving up... quite a lot... for an idiot child he just met. And many many many other scenes and actions that make no sense.Why does Fate and everyone keep taking off their helmets/masks in battle? DC still has not learned that it's stupid for this to happen to show off the actor.You also have another DC CGI villain who is just there to be a CGI villain.

Dwayne Johnson is outstanding as the anti-hero Black Adam and is supported by some other excellent acting performances especially from Pierce Brosnan. The ex James Bond actor is brilliant as Dr Fate (DC's version of Dr Strange) and even though the hero's used within the film are not your average household names they are used brilliantly in tandem with Johnson's character. There is lots and lots of action which we both loved which is a breathe of fresh air from other hero films recently which seem to forget they are meant to fun and action packed rather than completely story driven.I am slightly disappointed to hear that DC do not plan to make a Black Adam 2 as I think they have a good opportunity to create a great franchise. If they do not plan a sequel I just hope they plan to use Black Adam is other future DC films.","

"joshuanichols-64320","11 November 2022","What I actually ended up watching was nothing short of completely unwatchable garbage.First of all, the editing. OH MY GOD, THE EDITING. Every single scene in this film, not just the action sequences, made me feel like I was having a stroke and made it almost impossible for me to even try and invest in anything going on. I'm not joking when I say that most, if not all of the talking scenes follow the same trend of there being a deep focus on the characters face, the character saying 1-2 sentences, the camera immediately cutting to the next character who says 1-2 sentences or even simply making 1 facial expression, and then immediately cutting to the next person. As someone who usually isn't nitpicky about film editing all that much, even I have to point out how nauseous and distracting it is that there is an average of 10 cuts per 15 seconds throughout the entire experience. The fact that 95% of the editing actually got approved past post production and made it into the final product is utterly beyond me. I genuinely wonder how people could even have fun with this film when, even by simple human comprehension standards, everyone should have been suffering just trying to look at this film.But even if you could possibly ignore this one fatal flaw that would make the entire experience near unwatchable enough on its own, the movie is still terrible. The core conflict behind this film is supposed to be exploring the idea of whether Black Adam is actually a hero or not since he constantly kills any one who stands in his way or oppresses his people, with this JSA team being the pure opposing force to his actions. On paper, that seems like a very intriguing premise, right? Well, in execution, the movie fails to bring any of the nuance that would make this idea even remotely work or have stakes. The villains of the film are nothing but ruthless, 1 note cartoon villains who opress Black Adams homeland for.....reasons, and who we aren't asked to sympathize with at all, so why should we be doing anything but rooting for Black Adam to kill them? I'm sorry, but these people are just not worth living if they won't stop at anything to oppress and/or kill innocent people that are actually worthy of life. So this movie's attempts at trying to make Black Adam not seem wholly heroic, especially with him outright saying it dozens of times, just comes off as extremely edgy, and the ideology driving the JSA's actions becomes really forced and empty.Half of the actors in this film don't even seem interested in giving decent performances. With the boy in particular who was nothing but a supportive mouthpiece for Black Adam and the plot not being able to change his single facial expression to save his life, even when people he cares about are actively getting threatened.I also like how the exposition in the film just never ends. You never feel the weight of anything when people are constantly explaining the plot and their respective backstories to the audience, rather than the filmmakers deciding to opt to show them. Literally the only things keeping me from giving this movie a 1/10 is Pierce Brosnans performance and chemistry with the rest of the characters, a surprisingly good and unique score, and decent visual effects.I do not know how anyone could have possibly enjoyed this film. Again, it's not even fun bad. It's just complete garbage that represents all of the worst traits of studio franchise filmmaking. Please, do not waste the price of a movie ticket and 2 hours of your time on this. If you want to watch a really fun and off the walls action movie with with a wide, varied, and great cast, and distinct characters to compliment said cast, then Bullet Train is far more worth the price of admission. Or if you simply want great artistic fairs to see at the theatres, then you'll love Banshees of Inisherin, Tar, and the Fablemans. Just please. You can do better than this.","

"krzysiektom","12 December 2022","Rubbish. It's hard to imagine a superhero, big budget film with Brosnan and the Rock to be so boring... but they have achieved that! Awful script, predictable, clichéd, with a wooden dialogue and a wooden acting by Rock. He acts here as if he were a wooden plank indeed. Too much of special effects, some of them really lousy... Overbearing, constant music... It was really a challenge for me to not leave the screening earlier. Shame on Pierce Brosnan for participating in this, probably the worst and stupidest movie he has ever been in. And lastly: the Imdb requirement of at least 600 characters is IDIOTIC.","

"muziqaz","26 November 2022","What is this drivel? Does anyone at DC actually know how to develop a character? Or stitch up filmed/CGI clips into sequential movie?Who is hawkman? What is Justice Society? Who is that colourful whirlpool chick? What's up with the discount Antman. Is Pierce Brosnan portraying discount Dr. Strange? WTF are they doing in Kahndaq? The Lara Croft lady said it correctly: Who are you, why are you suddenly here and not when country needed them to be freed from occupation. Why does it feel like every scene in the movie is like a separate clip without any sense of continuation? And did writers have a meeting after everything was written and read through the script and decided this scene needs a lame joke, or that scene needs something comedic, because that's how it felt: forced humor. Conversations between whirlpool chick and discount Antman: is this how kids talk to each other these days?Movie felt like Hobbs vs Shaw in DCU.What's up with the credit scene? Why are movie creators trying to push sequel through this forceful out of place animosity between heroes? I mean Black Adam just went through 2 hours of character development to become reasonable and somewhat see good and have purpose. At the end of the movie he said country needs protector, which is a codename for ""he is keeping it to himself and protecting/rebuilding the country"". Yet credit scene shows that dumb**s invite the challenge for more destruction. Like, dude, you have plenty to do in Kahndaq, give it a rest. But yeah, nah, forceful dialogue with Superman will sort it out.And CGI...The slow motion... It's year 2022, not 1999.I'd have gladly watched origin stories for Hawkman, discount Antman, whirlpool chick and discount Dr Strange and finally justice society before Black Adam, but guess DCU start their story telling from the middle.","

"nogodnomasters","7 November 2022","The production begins with the backstory of Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) in 2600 BCE. In some Middle Eastern location known as Kahndaq before the pyramids and Babylon which isn't exactly correct. A slave finds the rare mineral eternium (DC likes pretend elements) which through a series of circumstances creates a hero who says Shazzam to fight the villain demon who says Sabbac. (I'm not making this up.) It then switches to modern day Kahndag which is still occupied by the Intergang who exploit the nation's natural resources, yadda, yadda, yadda. The Intergang is futuristic with their two way wrist band screens, but still use walkie -talkies. Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) is a wanted rebel and our protagonist. She wants to locate the eternium crown worn by Ahk-ton who says Sabbac and never ""Ni"". She wants to prevent the Intergang of finding it first, so she wants to find it and rehide it. If you have ever seen this done in any movie the script writer only knows how to have the bad guys follow the good guys who lead them right to it. Faced with certain death and the bad guys getting the crown she says a bunch of words and a bullet proof Dwayne Johnson (redundent?) appears and takes them out. With nearly 90 minutes of film left, it doesn't end so soon. A bunch of guys from the Justice League show up, the ones we haven't seen yet, and they go after our bald hero because he works like a bull in a China shop and kills bad guys rather than take them all prisoner and torture them with a comfy chair. We end up in a three way battle as more plot fills in.The film has all kind of posters for the DC heroes we know like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman and even some dropped DC comic books as more product placement. Pierce Brosnan plays Dr. Fate because Dr. Strange is Marvel and Sean Connery is dead. Some of the CG effects left something to be desired, especially early in the film I was thinking did Asylum make this? My biggest disappointment was the limited usage of the Dwayne Johnson humor. It was very dry humor, by design. They could have saved a lot of money and had Eric Fields play the part and say it was Dwayne Johnson. Hmm. Maybe they did that.Guild: I did hear a quick F word spoken by Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) when he messed up and had to turn around.","

"timgv-d-berg1997","27 November 2022","In fact the movie is about 4 lame rip-off super heroes and a reworked kind of chaotic good version of superman. The story is predictable and forgettable, the dialog is lame and the characters are mostly idiots and there is just no reason to care about them at all. I don't know any of these super heroes yet they are portrait as if we should know them by heart. And really we already do know all of them since they are just a rip-off from other superheroes. Mainly Dr strange, falcon, deadpool, and then a weird combo of superman and storm. You could honestly play this at 10x speed and still understand everything that happened. In the first 5 min they do a quick overview of black adams history filmed in a zack snyder style and I can say with full confidence that that's the best part of the movie, and you could easily make that a 2 hour film and have it be way better than this. Assuming it was directed by zack snyder. I guess the one upside is the minimal inclusion of a leftist political agenda.","

"lorna-adair-133-801166","24 October 2022","For crying out load DC you had a blockbuster on your hands and the standard of CGI villain was laughable.The costume worn by Black Adam was average ( Green Lantern had a better one). Distracting cod piece and they made his rear end flat.What was the point in Atom Smasher and Cyclone they were just there to make the numbers up, Hawkman must admit I clapped when he got stabbed. The MVP of this whole film was Dr Fate, played amazingly by Pierce Brosnan, although not on screen for long I would easily watch a film on his character alone.Thank goodness for the mid credit scene is the only way this deserves a sequel.","

"Kritikalodia","21 November 2022","The movie was announced so long ago that much of the excitement was lost by the time it came out, especially because of the disastrous experiments post Nolan's tryst with DC. Black Adam keeps it straight and simple without attempting too many subplots but that doesnt help because most of the characters are really inconsequential including the Justice Society. The actor's give their best but they are made to walk oft trodden plotlines. So, nothing really to watch out for except Brosnan's charm and Dwayne's smoldering Rock postures. Dwayne could have done better than his usual stares but beyond histronics he was never really a great actor. And what a joke of a villain they have made of such terrible VFX. Is the 'superhero cinema' dead?","

"Robosharp","7 January 2023","I got fifty minutes in and couldn't watch anymore. It was simply a waste of time. This was a generic CGI fest that moved at cartoon pace.There have been so many of these type films in recent times, I've lost count. You would think that cinemagoers would call time on it but apparently not. The youth of today seem to lap this kinda crap up and therefore the movie companies will keep churning them out.Please Hollywood, please, take a chance on something different. Something original, something with a story. A story that we get lost in, gripped by. Something that leaves you stuck in your seat at the end, too captivated to move. Remember those films? Feels like a long long time ago.Black Adam is none of the above and quite frankly the contrary. Thought it might at least be funny having the Rock in it - it isn't.","

"jdowney-57-371157","15 January 2023","This movie is pretty much the perfect example of why DC hired James Gunn. It's clear that director Jaume Collet-Serra was not a DC comic book fan. Nor does it appear that anyone associated with the movie was. And that is what is wrong here.John Favreau, who directed Ironman, as example, was a fan boy as a kid. All the Marvel movies had Stan Lee at least involved. When producers and moneymen hand the movie over to people who are doing a job but don't understand the passion that drives comic book fans about their respective universe, you wind up with this flashy action pack junk kind of movie.It starts with the plot and dialogues. People got a nice paycheck to write the story...and they don't have any investment in the characters.One example: a standard character, the precocious all too smart kid who cracks wise and cozies up to the hero... the first scheme we meet him in is sneaking past an 'Intergang' checkpoint.. his dialogue to the thug who stops him - ""What you are is a neo-imperialist enforcer from halfway around the world sent here to steal my country's natural resources, strip-mine our sacred mines, pollute our water, oppress our heritage, and make us wait in line all day"". That is actual dialogue. The kid continues in this vein throughout the film.So of course, before its all over...little buddy gets kidnapped by the baddies and our hero has someone to save.Prety lame.In the same way, the lady who ran the Suicide Squad shows up to introduce us to a basically random bunch of people called 'The Justice Society'. We don't know who they are. We don't really care. But they come to attempt to shut down Black Adam, and then make an alliance of sorts with him.Now the problem here is the Justice Society is an old DC Supergroup. Two of these characters, Hawkman and The Atom (who is called Atom Smasher in this movie) were two solid characters from the DC Comics of the Silver Age. Here they are just random unexplained heroes, and since Antman stole Atom's thunder, they go with 'Atom Smasher' who only gets bigger not smaller. And who the hell is Hawkman here? No idea. Why is Dr. Fate his 'old friend'? We don't know. Quintessa Swindell plays Cyclone. She is cute, vivacious and had a great presence...but her lines were lame, her purpose in the film was unimportant, and again...who she was or what she was doing there is just not explained. Mainly she and Atom Smasher are young and get to talk to each other while the adults are busy.And of course: The Rock. The thing about Dwayne Johnson that makes him popular is his self-deprecating sly humor. This character is so humorless that it strips Johnson from a chance to really connect with the audience and get buy in.As other reviews have noted...the CGI and fight scenes provide some spectacle. But that is it...a make believe country, some international gang with flying motorcycles for no reason, a bunch of heroes we don't know, the rock looking pumped up and dour, and an annoying kid and mom combo to play the middle eastern version of Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen to Black Adam.James Gunn...go back and read the Silver Age comic books. DC had not only the Big Duo of Supe and Batman...they had Hawkman, Atom, Green Arrow, Flash, The Metal Men. You can spend a decade bringing those characters to life, the way they were in that era (when they were at their most popular). It's exactly what Marvel did. I have no idea why DC can't figure that out.","

"mrshowrab","23 October 2022","The movie felt so fast like it didn't even finished a scene and moved on to the other. I couldn't enjoy the scenes or the action scenes as it felt too fast in the first 1 hour. The story is pretty weak they should have shown the backstory of black adam more but they focused on only the fight scenes. It's okay for a action movie to have fight scenes but it felt too much of just action without real rythm behind it. This movie could have easily be one of the best action movies if they increased the duration of the movie to atleast 2 hours 30 mins. They tried to pack so much in just 2 hours it felt unfinished. This is the sad part
But overall I liked the movie due to some minor flaws it made a big impact. That's why I gave this score.","

"arabnikita","21 October 2022","Black Adam (2022)The superhero genre has definitely taken a beating in 2022 with The Batman and The Boys being the only enjoyable things. Simultaneously , there haven't been too many movies that felt like ""Cinema Musts"" as most of them could be either watched at home without missing out on the impact, or skipped altogether. Black Adam was on my anticipated list because The Rock has been raving about it for years and when that much passion was put into a project, something had to come out of it.The story centers around Black Adam who returns to the fictional Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq that is being oppressed and exploited by external occupants. The people are desperate for a savior and Black Adam serves up a brutal kind of justice that attracts the attention of Earth's superheroes. The movie is definitely not the finest example of complex writing as it fails to juggle multiple characters, and some moments often feel like a parody. However, it more than compensates for it with vividly exhilarating action that is served up in a consistent manner without allowing the audience to rest.Black Adam is not your typical hero; he has a moral code of ethics, but when it comes to serving justice, this man has no ""off"" switch. It's honestly impressive how they managed to sneak in all this violence and still have a PG13 rating. I wasn't familiar with any character besides Hawkman so everything including the protagonist, was a pleasant novelty to me. Pierce Brosnan brought the sophistication, Cylcone added the eye pleasing grace and The Rock supplied all the bombastic action and machismo that a superhero movie could need.Is it everything that I anticipated? Well not exactly but it satisfied both the cinematic and superhero cravings that most films have failed to do this year. Unexpectedly, there was some hit & miss humor and a soundtrack that was the most heart pumping thing since Wonder Woman. As an added bonus, the film actually draws some meaningful modern world parallels. The superhero balance has definitely shifted and there is a new Alpha on the scene who is not to be triffled with, as you will see in the post credit scene.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.","

Character drivers are flimsy, cgi effects badly executed and too many influences from other franchises.I am unsure why the DCEU just drops in new characters and tries to make them key players without a subtle introduction in other films.The cavil reveal was exciting, but the 2 hours prior didn't do anything to help save the universe. THE Suicide Squad opened new doors, and gave hope to those invested in the future of dc films.Wait for streaming, it's worth the streaming admission price.","

He is so ubiquitous that his presence is movies is stale, generic, as he has never played a character of substance or depth. This movie confirms and highlights that he is nothing more than an movie star, and he is not an actor. The movie itself is boring, convoluted and unnecessarily long. The character development lacks and their is no true investment in this team of lackluster C lost superheroes whom have not even been whispered in the last 10 years.

Etc etc.The DC and Marvel universes sometimes merge and the writers of this DC film seem to have been heavily influenced by Marvel's X-Men:Apocalypse. The pierce brosnan character is similar to Dr Strange and the team around him are metas rather than mutants. It's all too predictable and the ending sets it up for a sequel. I hope they don't. It's all too derivative and all about making money. There is no art involved and, for me, the whole super hero genre should be given a rest until some real new ideas emerge.","
