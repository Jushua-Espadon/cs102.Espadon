"Minus_The_Beer","31 March 2018","With the seemingly endless popularity of superheroes, robots, dinosaurs and gigantic monsters on the big screen, it was only a matter of time before a franchise where superheroes transform into gigantic robotic dinosaurs to battle gigantic monsters would be resurrected. That's right: everyone's favorite half-hour toy commercial from the '90s is back to kick nostalgic butt! The ""Power Rangers"" have been re-booted with a slickly made, big-budget popcorn flick that wants to remind you of your care-free childhood days spent in front of the TV. It also probably wants you to forget the atrocious 1995 film.
It almost works.
With a gang of fresh young faces in place, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers get back into action, sans the clumsy Mighty Morphin title. Also missing in action is a great deal of the trademark humor and inherent corniness that made the original series so much fun to watch, even long after most of us had grown up and out of it. In place of these elements are a stronger focus on character and backstory, as we not only get to know more about the teen titans, but also about their allies and enemies. Yep, even the Rangers' big-headed mentor Zordon and his haywire sidekick Alpha (played by Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader respectively) get some time to shine, as we learn more about how they came into contact with the power of the Rangers. Likewise, villainess Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) is given ample time to roam and wreak havoc, as she murders her way across town in search of gold, all the while jamming some Social Distortion. We're a long way from after-school Fox TV, friends.
The kids all play variations of the characters we came to recognize in the original run. Here we have Jason/The Red Ranger, the natural leader and jock with a heart of gold, as played by Dacre Montgomery. Stealing nearly every scene is RJ Cyler as Billy/The Blue Ranger, a brainiac who proudly confesses to being on the spectrum. Naomi Scott steps into the role of Kimberly/The Pink Ranger. This version of Kimberly is a rebel and a frequent target of bullies (haters gon' hate). Rounding out the crew are Becky G as Trini/The Yellow Ranger and Ludi Lin as Zack/The Black Ranger. These characters feel slightly under-cooked in comparison to the three ""leads."" Trini and Zack both appear troubled and withdrawn, proud conformists who are tough as nails. A glimpse into their respective home lives gives each character a little more dimension. Together, the five teens must learn to work together if they are to stop Rita's plan to end all human life. In spite of the film's short-comings, all five actors are on point and keep things are lively as possible, even when the script fails them.
Most folks are going to come into a film like this expecting a super smash of monster on robot action, and although the back half of the film makes good on that promise, the hour and a half (!) that leads up to it might leave some viewers (especially the younger ones) a bit cold. While the increased focus on character is more than welcome (given how shallow the original series was), it gets a bit redundant a third of the way in. The new characters are established firmly from the start, but the story doesn't quite know how to advance from there, leaving the middle piece of the film a little laggy and repetitive. A lot of the story beats we've seen from other (and better) superhero films are repeated and to be quite honest, it gets hard not to tune out. When the slam-bang finale comes crashing down, it (mostly) quenches the thirst for big, goofy fun but not quite. The end result is a film that feels a little muddled, as if the committee that pieced it together didn't quite know what target audience they were trying to reach. Not as dumb as ""Transformers"" but not as fun as, say, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ""Power Rangers"" straddles the middle a little too comfortably. Or maybe these characters and their accompanying concepts work better in smaller doses. There's still some fun to be had here, make no mistake, but more often than not, it feels like these Rangers are operating with slightly diminished power.","

"NewGirlNickMiller","30 November 2018","Everyone that is writing a negative review of this film is saying that it didn't live up to expectations, ruined their nostalgia, was boring, was stupid, etc. So let's address some of that.Didn't live up to expectations:
If you're going into this movie expecting something amazing and ground-breaking, you're going to have a bad time. If you're expecting something more like Transformers, you'll have fun.Ruined nostalgia:
Nostalgia is a self-ruiner. Nothing ever lives up to what you remember when you were a wide-eyed child filled with wonder. Let's face it. Power Rangers was a really dumb kid's show even back then. We all just think it was baller, because we were kids when it was airing.Boring:
Some say it was boring, and I'll admit it was slow to start. It took a while to get it's stride, but if you can stick it out, it's a pretty fun movie.Stupid:
This movie has all the teenage high schooler tropes. I mean, you would almost think it were a modern day John Hughes film in the first half hour or so, because god is it tropey. That's okay though. I feel like the production team did this on purpose. This film doesn't take itself that seriously, really.My take on it is that it was fun. There were parts where I cringed. There were parts where I wanted to just shut it off. I'm glad I stuck it out, because it's not a terrible film as long as you're not expecting something on the level of Hitchcock. If you are expecting that...why?Remember, think for yourself when it comes to film. Don't take reviews too seriously, because not everyone has the same tastes.","

"nogodnomasters","15 July 2017","The film opens in the Cenozoic Era with aliens coming to Earth. In New Age fashion, a crystal in the earth creates a life force. We shift to modern times and are introduced to three of the would-be Rangers in detention. We get to know Zack (Ludi Lin) and Trini (Becky G.) a little later. Perhaps the worst thing you can do is to share your innermost secret with a group of teen peers, but that is what they did in order to become a team and save the world vs. a Gold Golem.The younger you are, the more likely you will enjoy the film. It is aimed at the teen. It had great graphics, although the Alpha-5 was as convincing as the alien in ""Explorers."" Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) was a little on the cartoonish side and I am not convinced of her alien name.I was too old to have watched the MMPR so I can not make comparisons. I will say they simplified the title by dropping the Mighty Morphin' part, making it a bit more mature. Bryan Cranston was barely noticeable as Zordon.Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity.","

"amichnea","27 June 2017","Anyone that was a child when the Power Rangers was on TV will be early 30's to late early 40's. Writing a review based on your memories stating that this movie destroyed the Power Rangers of old time is just sad.I actually liked it and yes I am one of those kids. The movie is very simple. They are building up the characters, each being a misfit, they are teenagers so YES you will get a lot of the teenager drama that comes along with being a teenager. It is pretty much an Origin Superhero movie, slow at start but ending with a Bang when the heroes discover their full potential.Why would anyone compare this to the Transformers? It is filmed the same way, the special effects are pretty much the same but this is because at the end of the day they have similarities (robots, transforming) and they can only show them one way. Bear in mind that Power Rangers type of series have been around since the 70s and 80s especially in Japan and China. So NO they did not copy Transformers and the first Power Ranger movie was actually done before any of the Transformers movies. Unfortunately any movie that shows big robots and morphings will be compared to the Transformers.The movie does keep true to the original series and I have enjoyed it. I also liked seeing some of the original rangers in the crowd.Does it deserve a 10? Probably not but neither does a 1 nor do other waste of time movies/series deserve a 10. Your kids will enjoy it and so will you.","

"lesleyharris30","15 April 2017","Power Rangers is an atrocious movie with a poorly developed plot and an disinterested cast. I did not have high expectations for this film, but I was a fan of the television series as a child and thought it would be a fun tribute. Instead of that, it takes what made the Power Rangers a hit in the late nineties and forcefully updates it for today's standards, taking itself far too seriously for such a ridiculous property. The majority of the cast are uninspired, clearly only there for a pay check. The Rangers, with the exception of RJ Cyler and Ludi Lin, seem to have no desire or ambition to act. The more A list cast do not shine either, Elizabeth Banks is far too sweet and attractive to thrill us as the lead antagonist, while Bryan Cranston just seemed out of place, which was a shame, as he could do so much better. For an action film, it is not very exciting. It takes up far too much time setting up the Rangers, followed by about twenty minutes of poor action sequences that are jam packed with CGI and poor one liners. I found myself regretting my decision to watch this movie more and more throughout. Dull and poorly paced, Power Rangers is too serious to be fun, but not serious enough to be intriguing, I would avoid this one. A group of teenagers use new powers that they have been bestowed with to protect the galaxy. Best Performance: RJ Cyler / Worst Performance: Elizabeth Banks","

"Mr-Fusion","7 July 2017","Two hours long and it takes them 90 minutes to finally don the costumes. That's the essence of ""Power Rangers"", a movie that offers plenty of buildup with a clumsy payoff. A lot of money and time went into the mo-cap, but there's something to be said about the fluidity of spandex fight scenes. And strangely enough, I think I liked it better while it was a generic superhero origin story, ""Breakfast Club"" archetypes and all. Even still, these are decent actors and they breathe life into a pretty weak script.It's funny, I was never a Power Rangers fan growing up (though I certainly put in the effort) but I didn't end up liking this movie because of the writing; too much effort turning this into a serious teen drama and not focusing on the goofy appeal of the show. It was silly then and it should be now.5/10","

"tr91","22 June 2017","Most people had already decided that this film was going to be bad, so you knew it would get panned either way.I liked the original show as a kid in the 90s but with the numerous spin off shows and movies that followed, I never really stuck with the series. I got older and simply moved on to different things. Apart from the basics, my memory of Power Rangers had pretty much faded. This isn't exactly a film that we needed but I thought it's 2017, it probably has a big budget so it may well be fun. While I found it to be watchable, there was plenty of faults that even a casual viewer will notice. The story is simple but takes way too long to get going. There is simply not enough material here to warrant a 2 hour run time. There isn't really anything exciting about any of the characters and the first half just shows them meeting each other. I liked Billy (pretty funny) the most. OK so an hour later and a lot of talk about nothing, we learn that there is a villain who wants to destroy the world and the Power Rangers are the only ones who can stop her from doing so. Obviously. Then we have some failed Morphin and finally they suit up (with like 20 minutes left of the film). The action scenes were good but nothing special. The suits were kinda weird and the Red Ranger looked more like The Flash. I would say the thing that annoyed me most about this film was the dialogue. I can honestly say I think they spoke more about Krispy Kreme than being actual Power Rangers. Too much unnecessary build up and the action scenes at the end just weren't spectacular enough. Despite all the faults, I still found it to be watchable. I don't think it is really aimed at fans of the old shows/people wanting nostalgia. It is more about gaining a new set of fans and it wouldn't surprise me to see more films/shows following on from this one.","

"Leofwine_draca","7 January 2018","POWER RANGERS is a big screen outing for the 1990s TV phenomenon and much better than I expected it would be given the usual quality of a Hollywood blockbusters. It's heavily inspired by the likes of PACIFIC RIM and TRANSFORMERS and yet it has a character all of its own, and it's chock-full of references to the TV series as well as Japanese comic book creations in general. The main good thing about it is that the cast remains likeable despite being young, fresh, and too good looking by half; RJ Cyler is a particular stand-out in this respect. The film gets progressively more and more immersed in CGI as the story progresses, but it remains light and watchable and funny at times. Elizabeth Banks threatens to spoil things with another over the top performance but thankfully doesn't have too much screen time.","

"mickdansforth","12 June 2017","I was a young adult by the time Power Rangers started broadcasting on Fox. I enjoyed the Toei footage that Saban interwove with their newly shot footage for the show. By the Saved-By-The-Bell type footage of the American kids in Power Rangers made the show unwatchable to me. In the 00's, after buying Godzilla vs Megaguirus from Hong Kong on Ebay, I started buying Hong Kong DVDs of Ultraman, Masked Rider and eventually, semi-reluctantly some of the Super Sentai shows. And I found the Super Sentai shows, minus any US shot footage, to be really great. Absolutely nothing I heard or saw about this movie before seeing it appealed to me in any way. I don't trust Saban as a creative force, and none of the gritty reboot talk, or reveals appealed to me in any way. And Bryan Cranston in blockbusters is usually him cashing a big check for as little screen time as possible, and I have no idea if he was actually on set with his costars or not, but if he was not, you can't tell from the performances because the ""teens"" sell it. But once we start meeting the kids, I found them and their stories very compelling. It quickly became obvious that instead of retreading Save By The Bell of the teen drama, they were using The Breakfast Club as source material. And it works. This movie makes you care about these kids and their struggles. The exploration of their power is fun, and the all out action is great, if short, but the heart of this movie is the team learning to love themselves and each other and how to work together as a team. David Denman from Traffic Light (who was also Skip on Angel) was great as the Red Ranger's father. They used him a lot and he played his part well. Erica Cerra from Eureka has one short scene as the Yellow Ranger's mom, where the camera never rests on her long enough to recognize her, but she did her part great. Elizabeth Banks is awesome per usual and Bill Hader doesn't ruin anything. I hope this movie pulls in enough money to warrant a sequel because I definitely want to see more.","

"jaidanh","3 March 2021","The majority of this Power Rangers movie is just some teen angst drama. Now I have nothing against teen angst being portrayed in film and TV. But we're talking about a Power Rangers movie. This movie tries too hard to be serious and mature. There's humor every once in a while, but it doesn't fit with the serious tone. And while we're on the subject of seriousness, the color palette used in this film is very dull. It's the same washed-out color palette used in Man of Steel and Fantastic Four, which has been used in so many movies, and it's completely outdated.The script is quite bland with several pop-culture references. Some of the dialogue can be inappropriate for the kids that watch this film.The acting is okay, but the characters have feeble character development and can be very unlikeable. The most likable characters I can think of are Jason and Billy. Other than that, there's not a lot of characterization for the heroes of this movie. I wouldn't consider them fit to be role models. The Rangers don't have strong chemistry with each other. In the original TV show, they were already friends before becoming the Power Rangers. In this film, since they're only meeting each other for the first time, they fail to build a connection and understand each other. Even Zordon can be seen as unlikeable. In this film, he can sound irritable, whereas Zordon in the original show was more optimistic.Some aspects in this film are just stolen from The Breakfast Club. I'm not saying that because the film opens with a detention scene. There's way more than that. For starters, the Power Rangers all follow the same character traits as the main characters in The Breakfast Club: The Nerd (Billy), the Jock (Jason), the Outcast (Trini), the Princess (Kimberly), and the Rebel (Zack). The campfire scene where the Power Rangers reveal bits about themselves is similar to The Breakfast Club's circle confession.One of the BIGGEST issues I have with this film is the mass product placement from Krispy Kreme. My god, it's everywhere between the middle and end of the film. The final battle literally takes place at a local Krispy Kreme.Speaking of the final battle, it's the ONLY fight scene in this 2-hour movie. If you were expecting this movie to be packed with fighting sequences, get ready to be disappointed.So yeah, I wasn't entirely pleased with this film. It doesn't have much replay value, and I wouldn't recommend this film to kids. I liked the visual effects and the soundtrack, but yeah, that's about it. This film was just very uninteresting. Hopefully, the next reboot does something much better.","

"I_Ailurophile","11 February 2023","This does NOT make a good impression right out of the gate. The brief prologue accentuates that this new vision of the franchise aims to be dark and gritty in the same way as too many modern superhero movies are; early exposition greets us with boorish ""humor,"" and overemphasis of shadows and dark hues in the color palette to further cement the grit. 'Power Rangers' concretely informs in early scenes - through direction, cinematography, action, stunts, effects, music, and more - that it's slick, modern, cool, and flashy. All it actually needed to be was fun, with cartoonish violence commensurate to what we saw in the TV show of the 90s. Instead we're greeted with grim violence that tries to be as realistic as possible, and cartoonish introduction of the characters' powers that's frankly a little cringe-worthy. (Remember Edward's demonstrations of his powers in the first 'Twilight' movie?) It tries so hard to update the concept with modern sensibilities of the MCU or DCEU, and with a mind for what teen and young adult viewers are accustomed to in recent years, that it becomes common and unexceptional, loses sight of what made 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' such a hit in the first place, and to be blunt, just becomes tired and obnoxious.It all looks great. A lot of hard work went into the production that I deeply appreciate. The diversity of the primary cast and characters is most welcome (though of course the chief protagonist has to be a white dude), and I think the cast performs well (even those in small supporting parts; hi, Erica Cerra!). Elizabeth Banks has minimal time on-screen as villain Rita Repulsa, but she's clearly loving it. The effects look good, both the practical creations and the regrettable overabundance of CGI (that is at least on par with anything in modern action flicks); the sets, costume design, and hair and makeup work are terrific. The crew put in good work all around. I don't agree with all the choices made behind the scenes, mind you, including instances of direction or cinematography. The new design of Zordon's lair, and how he presents, are plainly over the top, as is the new appearance of the power suits. The design of the Zords here frankly reminds too much of how the Transformers look in Michael Bay's ""live-action"" films - nondescript chunks of metal with no substantial identity, little more than junkyard kluges with slightly different color schemes and configurations.And that might be the real takeaway here, that 'Power Rangers' has no meaningful identity of its own. It's clearly a reimagination of an established franchise, yes, but it specifically takes all its cues from Marvel, and DC, and other blockbuster action flicks of the last 15 years or so (not least 'Pacific Rim') that after a point all tend to start blending together. This also applies, emphatically, to the writing. Characters and their development, dialogue, scene writing, narrative, plot development, humor, the forging of the team, and anything else one might name all work overtime to emulate comparable titles, becoming kind of indistinguishable in the process. The writing informs the execution in turn, so it and the direction, action sequences (that effectively wait until the last quarter to show up), music, and to some degree as well the acting, all share the same traits in some capacity: heavy-handed, overwrought, ham-handed, lacking tact or nuance, if not simply imitative and unremarkable - and at the same time, often coming across as weirdly oversimplified. The location of the MacGuffin leads to cheeky jokes that I suppose someone thought was unique and clever; the last moment in which we see the Megazord is both copied and pasted from other such fare, and altogether aggravating in its kitsch. Scenes of team building come off as the perfunctory, obligatory connecting of dots rather than earnest plot. And so on.I admire the effort. I distinctly disagree with too many decisions that were made in how to proceed with this feature, but everyone involved put their best foot forward and gave it their all, the cast and crew especially. I would, genuinely, like to see stars Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Becky G, and Ludi Lin in other pictures, and see more of what they're capable of. Yet whether the blame lies with director Dean Israelite, the team of writers, the producers, or someone else or some combination thereof, 2017's 'Power Rangers' is bereft of what made its predecessors so enjoyable in the first place (even at their worst), and just disappears into a very crowded sea of modern action films. There were, I think, some very good ideas here, but they rather get lost in the mix, and at best the title is basically just average. Factor in particular faults that grate on one's patience, and my favor takes another step down. Why, though in different ways, I think this is sadly on par with ill-considered franchise antecedent 'Turbo: A Power Rangers movie,' wherein the crew did good work, and the cast tried, but the writers and directors were just phoning it in. Well, no one is phoning in their contributions here, but the result is unfortunately just as uninspiring when all is said and done. I wish all participants nothing but the best, but whether you're an action buff or a devotee of all things Power Rangers, I just don't think this rendition makes the grade.","

"subxerogravity","23 March 2017","Another installment in nostalgia.When I first heard about the Power Rangers being brought back as a film franchise I was pretty jazzed about it. It does not hurt that the closest thing to bad press I heard about the movie was that they needed to push back the filming, which only allowed them to add the star power of Bryan Cranston and Elisabeth banks.Only indifference I had towards the movie was that as corny as the TV show was the concept of a group of overachieving teenagers being selected to become the best of the best makes sense (Especially because they are teenagers, they should be the best of the best at lease). Because dark is cool these days, the Rangers needed to have more edge to them, which is why this new team is made of ""diamonds in the rough"" who society has scrub off as screw-ups. So the idea is that Bryan Cranston who plays the big giant head Zordon, has the power coins pick those who have the potential to be the best of the best.Out of all the superhero movies that are coming out, Power Rangers is not the best of the best, it's definitely a diamond in the rough that has potential, but still needs more training. I did like the cast of teenagers who had some very distinctive personalities, as they try to even out the characters. I did love the fact that the Blue Ranger was played by a black dude, and The Black Ranger was played by an Asian dude (it's less distracting than what happen in the TV show).Bryan Cranston's star power did nothing to make his Zordon a better giant head, but Elisabeth Banks was great as Rita Repulsa. In a time with Superhero movies having weak antagonist, I got to say, I enjoyed what Banks did with the character and loved to see her on the screen.So I went into this really wanting to see this and I was not disappointed. It's not really what I expected as it's not the kung fu spectacular the TV show was, but it is a good movie. Not great just good.http://cinemagardens.com","

"WhenAmyMetSalad","21 April 2017","TL;DR - Slow, boring, not entertaining, Fant4stic was better. I followed this movie around the time it was first announced and even partook in the boards and seeing all the news and leaks about the movie. I was not too fond of certain things about this movie especially certain casting as I felt it wouldn't fit. I honestly really wanted to enjoy this movie but when the trailer hit I had a bad feeling and should have stuck to it. My friend dragged me to go watch it with him and I hated almost every minute. After reading mixed reviews the ones that resonated with me are the ones that shared my same opinions. The movie lacked good comedy, needed to improve on action. It dragged and dragged with these poorly acted characters and mundane character development for our protagonists. The only fun character was Rita. Elizabeth Banks did a great job making that character hers and making her feel more menacing than she was in the show. I've only ever liked her in one other franchise and that was The Hunger Games so to be honest I am surprised I liked Rita as much.--- ***SPOILERS BELOW***---The movie started off good with the ending of a battle scene which introduced our antagonist and the seriousness of a threat our heroes will encounter down the road. Rita literally kills the previous Ranger team and is the ever so loved Green Ranger which was teased and theorized throughout set photo leaks. This scene and the final Battle where Rita gets B-chSlapped to the moon was the only entertaining thing in this whole movie. Everything in between was utterly boring. You will seriously have a more fun time watching the Ghostbusters Remake or the Fant4stic reboot.","

"rgkarim","24 March 2017","In the 90's Saban unleashed onto our homes five teenage heroes dress in multicolored, state of the art underwear. What followed was legacy of aspiring actors fighting men in ashen grey costumes, before turning their attention to unique costumed antagonists that tried to stop their quest. And to this day Power Rangers continues to be a hit amidst the adolescent world as Nickelodeon continues to inspire them to fight as the rainbow warriors. So of course, we needed a movie to really seal the deal, based on the original series that started it all. Robbie K here to cover another movie. Let's get started. Summary: If you were a fan of the series like I was, then you will certainly be looking for that nostalgic adventure you had as a kid. Well the movie is able to bring some of that back as traditional characters (in new, hot, youthful skins) return to fight the forces of evil. But past the new cast, you'll be go go going crazy for all the throwbacks including: Zords, monsters, Rita's dramatic speeches, cameos, and of course the suits. It's fun to relive those childhood moments, making one laugh at all the memories that come rushing back in this new adventure. But if nostalgia won't make you smile, then certainly the comedy of the movie will be an entertaining factor. Power Rangers surprisingly is funny (and not in the cheesy way the classic series was). Each of the teens has their moments where they put their foot in their mouth or get a taste of humility as they eat pavement. But it is Billy who steals the show, as the autistic youth delivers well-timed comedy that grounds all the drama brought by this new generation of rangers. Yes, you heard me drama, this origin movie has far more drama than the series had back then and with it some surprising character depth. Where the 90's was cutesy love and bullying, this movie goes deeper down the teenage angst path. It works at times and helps expand on what once was limited roles. As for the action, Power Rangers is also decent in this category as well. This film has some fast-paced karate chopping action, that quickly melds into robot on monster smashing. The special effects are semi impressive, not so much in terms of realism, but capturing the spunk of Power Rangers. The Zords in particular are much smoother, and the modern twist on their design matches the edgier theme of the movie. And of course, there are lots of thrilling explosions and sound effects to bring it all to the front. While not as cheesy as Saban's classic fights, the battles in this film still have that energy we all fell in love with. Summary: Despite the deeper lore of the series, the teenage issues were also a little eye rolling as well. I know not to expect a masterpiece, but this Power Ranger plot felt like an after school special meeting a special effects show. I'm sure this will speak to many of the modern generation, but these issues just felt out of place compared to those in the 90s. Plus, the rebellious, delinquent protagonists aren't necessarily the ideal role models for the younger generations. Perhaps it was also the darker atmosphere that also detracted it from me. Despite added suspense and danger, the darker moments made the movie less fun for me at times. And to be honest, some of the darker moments were a bit disturbing at times, so please exercise caution if your kids are easily scared. Speaking of scary, the new direction they took with Rita Repulsa was not the most comforting thing to see. This portrayal was much more nightmarish, replacing Rita's grandiosity with pure insanity and lust as she feasted on ""gold"" from every source. While the edginess wins points for danger, the creepy (somewhat adulterated) portrayal of Rita did not impress me, nor did the overacting (again dramatic) walks/speeches she made through the movie. In addition, I wasn't a fan of the new Goldar, wondering why they replaced the cheesy (yet creative) chimera design for a CGigoldenVelveeta monster? Yes, the monsters certainly lacked that design we all loved, for again darker, edgier forms. In regards to the action, well as always, I wanted more. Power Rangers runs just a little over two hours, but only about twenty minutes of that is actually action. It would have been nice to have a little more investment in the combat scenes to really deliver the promised punch the first 90 minutes promised. For one thing, it would have been nice for all the weapons, not just a random appearing sword, to make an appearance as they fought for the sake of the world. That minor detail aside, the kung Fu scenes could have been longer, and the Zords could have had a little more coordination than just one or two taking a punch. In addition, the edgier Rita needed some more time to show off her skills (other than speeches and walking through CGI streets). The Verdict:Power Rangers is certainly a fun stroll down memory lane, filled with plenty of nostalgic references to make you feel sort of like a kid again. With a new edge comes character development and special effects that for the most part work. Yet, there are still some balance issues that need work, including stepping back from the darkness and increase the emphasis on action (and story). Still not a bad origins story. Worth a trip to the theater? For the special effects and adventure, definitely, but there are other movies better worth the price of admission. My scores:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0","

"pulkit110","4 July 2017","Five high school students accidentally acquire powers that make them super strong and fast and have to save the world. There's not much new going on in this movie as compared to the other super hero movies and it's more an origins story rather than a full fledged Power Rangers film. The worst thing about the movie is the villain. Rita is pretty bland and there's nothing interesting about her. The only thing going for the movie, in my opinion, is the humour and CGI. Overall, an enjoyable movie if you are a fan of power rangers or superhero genre in general. One time watch!","

"wmig-86583","4 September 2021","The movie starts very slow. And is a case of everything they do magically works in their favour. Spoilers!!In the first 45 minutes we see a bunch of different kids stumble across some stones, then make the cafeteria food and drink explode, jump 60 metres then coincidentally one falls into this big lagoon type thing in a cave and again, It works out for them finding this big alien ship. If you are expecting anything like the original power rangers you will be very badly let down.","

"afijamesy2k","23 March 2017","You know when I was 12 years old, I saw power rangers, I thought the first 2 seasons (1993-95) represent splendid action, suspense and real characters, but once season 3 came it all went downhill and this movie is another example at how jumped the shark the power rangers franchise has become, the performances are awful, the story is completely and absolutely confusing, the screenplay is a mess and the editing is a trainwreck, now I love bryan Cranston he's always been a wonderful actor, but he is truly wasted in this one as zordon, a man who help 5 teens with their magical powers and their customs to save angel grove from monsters and the evil rita repulsa (played terribly by Elizabeth banks) and other nonsense, this is just a pathetic and useless attempt to revive the power rangers franchise, it is just awful, this is one of the year's worst films, no offense to my friend who is a power rangers fan, but this movie stinks.","

"moviemattb","27 March 2017","It has been three years, since this was first announced as Lionsgate and Saban teamed up to do reboot of ""Power Rangers,"" and now it is finally here for the time in 2017. This movie came out on my Birthday, and got to see it the day after it came out, and all I got to say that ""Power Rangers"" was a morphinominal experience. I had such a fun time with this movie, and really had the pleasure to see a ""Power Rangers"" movie on the big screen like I never had before. I will not spoil this movie for you, because I want you to be surprised by it. Pressing on, the movie tells our five teenagers with attitude as they all come from different backgrounds, when they stumbled across as they found these power coins that gives them their own strengths and found a spaceship as they meet their mentor Zordon and his robotic assistant Alpha 5 as they are chosen to become Power Rangers. While that's going on, we have Rita Repulsa as she has come to Angel Grove to wipe out humanity as our five main heroes must come together as a team in order to save the world. It may be your typical origin story like you have seen a million times before, but it works on its own level. With that said, this is a darn good looking movie, and this does not look like a Michael Bay movie. This is definitely Dean Israelite's movie, the director that brought us ""Project Almanac"" which I really enjoyed that movie, and he really does care on making this movie as he knows how the fan-base really loves ""Power Rangers"" and never acting as a director that really wants a paycheck. I give him huge props for putting a lot care into making this movie, and his direction is absolutely wonderful. The way the movie opens, which I can't spoiled has made my jaw dropped and it was an incredible way to open. The movie's tone is dark, but it still retains the essence of ""Power Rangers,"" where it never forgets the cheese factors. This movie is like a cross between ""Chronicle"" meets ""The Breakfast Club."" I really do love the look of the movie as it is beautifully well filmed, and really has that the kind of atmosphere as it does look gritty, but still has the colors. Brian Tyler's music is epic, and I loved that kind of vibe as it really sounds very sci-fi, but for a coming of age superhero movie. You do hear, the ""Power Rangers"" theme song which it does make it a treat for fans that grew up with the series. The cast in this movie are just fantastic. Bryan Cranston as Zordon is really remarkable as he embodies the character as not only he plays as a wise mentor, but very complex as he is trying to get our heroes to become Power Rangers. Bill Hader as Alpha is really funny, and enjoyable to watch. I do enjoy the redesign of this character as he looks more like an alien robot, instead of some actor in a suit. No disrespect on the original Alpha, just like to point that out. Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa is really funny, but quite menacing at the same time. This Rita does a whole lot more, than just sitting at her palace doing nothing and she really does fight the Rangers. As for our heroes, Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, Ludi Lin, Becky Gomez, and R.J. Cyler have all done such a superb job to have great chemistry together as their acting is very natural and they all do have a charisma. They played flawed teenagers, as they go through real life issues instead of just being goodie goods from the show. They really are the Power Rangers for this generation. I am very pleased for this movie to go deeper into the mythology of Power Rangers as opposed to what the show couldn't do. The action in this movie is pretty good, and so does the special effects. The pacing is never slow, and really does keep me invested with the story, and as well with its characters. The humor, thankfully, doesn't have any of the burp or fart jokes like what happened to the recent ""TMNT"" movies. This has the right kind of humor like what Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have, and it knows when to have fun. I did cry during that one moment in the movie, but once again, cannot spoil it for you. Can't forget about the Zords and the suits as they look really cool in motion. Love them very much. Any flaws? Yes, but they are minored. As much as there was character development for the Rangers, but we kept getting more from Jason, Kimberly and Billy. Sure Zack and Trini do have moments to shine, but you wish there was more to them. Nevertheless, there was enough to care about them. As for Goldar, I thought the design of him looks interesting, and can see why they went with it as it fits within the context of the movie, but you wish he had more of a personality instead of being a run of the mill monster. Sure he is intimidating, but really wanted more from him. So I find this Goldar both good and bad at the same time. I really love this movie, and really do enjoy the aspects of teamwork as it does add to the heart of the movie. ""Power Rangers"" is a loving tribute to the series, and you are going to have a wonderful time at the movies as it appeals to the old and new generation of fans. Kids can enjoy it, and so can adults. This was the best Birthday that I've ever had, and I am giving ""Power Rangers"" a 10 out of 10.","

"MichaelNontonMulu","22 March 2017","My wife and I were pretty entertained with this movie. It was quite  full of humor and fun all around. Watching the new Power Rangers suits  were also pretty cool, especially if we compared against the suits from  the original TV series back in the 1990s. Of course the special effects  in this movie was pretty amazing. The CGI was done pretty nicely and  neat. Loved the action sequence in the last part of the movie during  the fight between the Rangers and Goldar. Sound effects were good, and  maybe would be more amazing if you see in Dolby Atmos theaters.  After watching it for full 2 hours, the movie duration seemed to be  just nice. It was not too rushed in the process of characters  introduction and the time spent for the training to become the Power  Rangers felt sufficient. It did not take too long or too short, and  still have enough time for the big finale. Overall, the pace of the  movie felt just perfect. The movie had brief moments of jokes that felt  more appropriate for teenagers and not suitable for children. So I feel  that the movie seemed to be aimed more for teenagers rather than for  children, although the original series were actually shown in kids TV.  This is also the reason why a lot of adults also watched this movie to  reminiscent the good fun time when they watched the series (my wife was  a great example of this audience).  In addition, the movie also had some cheesy moments and felt very  light. There was no over-complication of plots, just a simple good old  fashion pop corn movie to be enjoyed without over thinking. For this  kind of movie, people should not expect a deep conversation and various  twists. This is a movie that I feel would provide the fans of the  original series satisfaction. Almost all the characters were there in  the movie, with of course other characters that might join the sequels.  This movie also had some brief interesting scene during the mid end-  credit part. But there was nothing at the very end. So there is no need  to wait till the very last scene if you are in a rush to the wash room.   So if you are looking for a fun light team of superheroes movie based  on the popular 1990s TV series, then you would not be disappointed and  you would be entertained by this. But if you are looking for a heavier  super hero movies from popular comic books like Marvel comics or DC  comics kind, then this might not be your thing. Especially if you are  expecting a heavy drama full of logics kind of movie. The choice is  yours.","

"vasco_cid","24 March 2017","High on the heels of frantic superhero revivals of past, Lionsgate acquired another niche property of the 90's in hopes of launching another multi-million dollar franchise. Luckily enough for me, being a long time hardcore fan, Power Rangers was the chosen product. I realise the cynicism of my over excitement for this film and my overwhelming praise for it, being a detractor of the Marvel cinematic universe, but subjectivism and personal nostalgia end up playing a big part in relating to these films, so... tough luck.Power Rangers is not and was never a franchise for everyone. Its sole selling point was a very childish one, that you either related to or not. The story lines and plots were recycled, thin and repetitive and it's very cheesy and campy nature was never shed under a rug; it was always thrown directly into our faces. Nevertheless, the ""narrative"" potential of the series was hinted on some occasions and was only sporadically developed either because budget constraints held it back or because it never HAD to.What Dean Israelite did here was nevertheless smart, sensible and necessary: adapting the property into the 21st century, focusing and developing characters (that were never), taking creating liberties that were harmless and present us a full-fledged nostalgia punch, armed with heart, humour and excitement. The same as the original series, the film knows it's cheesy. It knows the premise is far-fetched. But the source material asks that of you; and the reason why we escape to movies (these genre specifically) is not to find some way to fit the story into our world. It is to find escapism, fun and entertainment - and this Power Rangers (film) delivers just that and then some. Power Rangers is not a perfect film. It will not please everyone, it will (sadly) not gross obscene amounts of money to launch the very optimistic plans for multiple sequels; but today I woke up with a wide grin knowing that this property was adapted and honoured so well despite its shortcomings, so sensibly to its publicised characters backgrounds and, most importantly, so respectfully to its legacy and fanbase.","

"MikeC19","11 May 2017","I was never a huge fan of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", but I went in, open to trying this film. I was sorely, sorely disappointed. I left this movie thinking, ""This was a *bad* movie!"" Now, there are movies out there, that are absolute garbage, the acting is bad, almost everything is bad. I admit, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, however, there's a lot wrong with it! The Bad: There's crude humor, lame and dated jokes we've heard in hundreds of other movies, some bad language and dozens of tired movie clichés. We've seen it all before is what I'm saying. There's is very little to be enjoyed in this movie. It's an origin story, that kind of lags a bit, and then the action is cranked up near the end, but it's not really that exciting. We've all seen the ""misfits who learn to work together"" story line, and that's all this is. I'm surprised that the creator of the original ""Power Rangers"" OK'd this version. It's pretty terrible for the most part.The Good: Bill Hader's character was amusing, Bryan Cranston brings some levity to this, and Elizabeth Banks does a great job of making you hate her character, which proves her acting is good. The main cast is a bit annoying, but they're OK at playing their stereotypes. Also, the score by Bryan Tyler was very good.So: This is a not a movie I would recommend. It may appeal to some teenagers, and it's not the worst thing they could be watching. Overall, it's just a bad film. Case closed.","

"destinymckenna","17 June 2017","**CAUTION: CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS** The movie definitely surpassed my expectations. When the trailer was first released, I thought about going to see it but was not truly interested. When it was released to the public, I bought it and was surprised to like it as much as I did. Though it won't be up for any awards, it was enjoyable and fun to watch.If you want to see it because you were a fan of the old television show, be prepared for disappointment. This movie was not made to appeal to the previous generations. It has elements of nostalgia, but if you go into it expecting what you watched as a kid, you will not like this movie.KEEP IN MIND PEOPLE that this movie is PG-13, so if you have KIDS, you might want to look out for cussing, sexual innuendos, rebellious behavior, and scenes that IMPLY things of a sexual nature. It's a film about teenagers, so what more could be expected? Tapping into the teenage world, it was refreshing to see teenage drama play out in a way that is true to the real world.And the characters are truly everything people have been asking for and a major step in the right direction for the film industry. You have black, white, Asian, Indian, and Latino characters all sharing lead roles with one being apart of the LGBTQ+ community and another with Autism. And both aren't shoved into the background at any point. There is even dialogue in the movie referencing their different colored Power Ranger suits and their different ethnicities: ""Five kids, five colors, five different colored kids!""Problems I had with the film include CGI not being the best at times and the characters taking quite a while to mesh together and become a team. You also don't get to see them in their armor until the ending of the movie, which I can understand they tried to build up for suspense but didn't work the way the crew wanted it to. The movie wasn't as action packed as you expect a superhero movie to be. While I liked the fact they incorporated the ranger colors into the costume design, it seemed to me like they tried to overcompensate for the bland armor of the TV show by creating something shiny and new, but that just fell flat in my opinion. They just looked awkward to me in the scenes where they finally had morphed. WOULD RECOMMEND.Despite some points, this movie is overall a great watch. The ending does hold a cliffhanger with the role of the green ranger in the next film, but with how this film did in theaters, I would say do not watch after the credits unless you want to be taunted with the idea of a movie that may not be created. Holding out for a sequel.","

"onionbagel","27 March 2017","Obviously everyone who was born after 1993 has seen some Power Rangers TV series, and some may have even seen the 1995 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie, so I don't think I need to explain WHAT Power Rangers are. With that being said, I'll get straight to the review.Whether you are ""young"" (people ranging from toddlers to 20+ year-olds), or an adult who watched Power Rangers with their kid, you will probably like this movie! Is it anything ""new"" or special; no, but it's an entertaining movie all the same. It's a lot like the first installment of most Marvel movies: Iron Man (1), Captain America: The First Avenger, Ant-Man, etc (roughly the first half of the movie is all about the superhero(s) learning to use their powers/learning to BE heroes). It's mainly story-driven, but it's got plenty of action! If you're looking for an Oscar-winning movie (like Lincoln, King's Speech, etc), you're not gonna find it here; however, if you're into action-packed superhero movies with (dumb teenage) comedy sprinkled in, AND you grew up with Power Rangers, you'll love this movie!","

"emersonbrowne","13 June 2017","I went into this movie with zero expectations. I only watched Power Rangers a little bit when was younger and was never really into it, but, I got to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I loved it, I think everyone involved did a very good job. There was a good mix of comedy, action, drama and even some sentimental moments. The actors all fit into their roles very well and some of them even surprised me. The cast had some well known actors/actresses such as Elizabeth Banks, Bill Vader and Bryan Cranston who all did very well in their roles. There was also a very good mix of new faces mixed in with Dacre Montgomery (who will be starring in season 2 of Stranger Things later this year.) Ludi Lin who was a very pleasant surprise. I have never heard of him before going to see this movie and now he is someone I am going to look out for in the future. Like probably most of you I have only heard some of Becky G's music but have never really given Her a second thought. When I heard she was going to be a main character in this movie I was a bit hesitant about it. I have never been happier to be proved wrong.She played the role of Trini perfectly and made her character someone that, I think, a lot of people can relate to. Naomi Scott as Kimberly was perfect casting. I loved her in Lemonade Mouth when I was younger so I was excited when I heard that she was cast in Power Rangers. She played the role of Kimberly very well and I definitely will be looking for her more in the future. Everyone did very well in their roles but to me, and I'm sure a lot of you, RJ Cyler stole the show. His portrayal of Billy was perfect. Billy was a very important character being the first superhero to be on the autism spectrum and RJ Cyler absolutely nailed it.Something that I personally am not a fan of in movies is a lot of CGI but, I got to say this movie pulled it off. It wasn't cheesy and went with the movie very well. I also have to mention the soundtrack in the film. every song fit the moment perfectly and added that extra bit to the movie. This movie was about all the characters becoming the Power Rangers and evolving. It takes a long time before they actually become the Power Rangers. The reason for doing this is to show how all of the characters develop throughout the movie which I think was a very dog move. Every character develops really well personally as well as a group. I really hope there is a sequel as the end set it up perfectly. At the end of this movie it shows the teacher at detention introduce a new character, Tommy. Introducing this character would be a good fit for the next movie (if there is one.) If they do decide to do another movie we will be able to see the rangers more experienced and, if they do decide to make Tommy a ranger, we can see how they adjust to the new addition.","

"joelhbk","24 March 2017","Don't go in expecting top notch acting, effects or writing. This movie was never meant to be an example of film making excellence. It's a great teen movie. It combines elements of the drama kids go through nowadays and of course heroism and supernatural fiction. It's like Breakfast Club, Chronicles, Pacific Rim and even a bit of Toy Story 3 all combined. I laughed, teared up, threw my hands in the air, and even though I acknowledge it has its issues I enjoyed the heck out of it. The kids have to work on their acting, tho. The comedy was cheesy here and there but it's Power Rangers so what you expect? Also they touch very relevant issues, like mental illness, peer pressure, bullying, etc. And the importance of friendship and unity. It gets pretty emotional here and there. And it doesn't really piggyback that much on the nostalgia element, but when it does it hits you square in the Yay! bone. Go watch it. It's silly entertainment and cheesy fun at its best. Like the first Transformers. I even like it more than the first Transformers actually.","

"hlazox","27 March 2017","From a power rangers point of view, I think this movie was a 10 on 10. People who are interested in watching this movie, must go into the cinema with the right expectations.Please don't expect this power rangers movie to be as deep, as a movie like 'the dark knight', 'batman v superman' or 'shawshank redemption'. Historically speaking, power rangers had a corny production vibe to it, especially visually and this is one of the reasons kids fell in love with it. Kids at a young age, aren't as could as they are when they get older at interpreting deep philosophical messages; which is why power rangers in general isn't the type of show/movie you watch, expecting to leave the theater with a huge epiphany about life.I'd class this movie as overall fun and entertaining to watch. What I loved about it is the was never a scene whereby I felt bored. Though let me not exaggerate things and make you feel like every scene has got action in it, which is obviously not true. The point is the movie manages to keep an audience who walks into it with the right expectations, actively engaged in it.The were moral lessons one can learn by watching the movie. Issues like how to work as a team, how to be a leader, human mortality, opening yourself up emotionally to your friends, resisting conforming to societal expectations and having an open mindset.A few downsides to this movie were the graphics kind of looked cheap -- as in the visual effects weren't as real-like, like a movie like star wars the force awakens in my opinion. The villain came off as corny and audiences who like serious movies, probably won't like this movie. Though keep in mind -- the cheap looking graphics, corny villain and sometimes lack of seriousness in this movie is what makes power rangers the franchise it is today.So don't go into the theater expecting a movie with extremely deep philosophical points, that tells us humans are ultimately self-serving individuals etc.","

"TheHonestCritic","22 November 2022","""Power Rangers"" (2017), before I start my review, for those who may not have seen the news, Jason David Frank, who played the original green and white ranger, a.k.a. Tommy Oliver, has died. He has acted across many episodes of ""Power Rangers"" media, including a cameo appearance in this ""film"". Not only was he a great actor, but he was also an incredible martial artist and fighter in real life. He did all of the fighting himself when he played his character, which added to his performances. Wow, what a great talent he was! So, let's have a moment of silence for him. All right, let's get back to the review. One thing I will say about this ""movie"", is that the best part, by far, was the Tommy Oliver cameo. Yeah, so you can probably already guess where this is going. This ""film"" sucks! ""Power Rangers"" has a confused and boring storyline, overall terrible acting, and a predictable soundtrack to try and tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, Earth is invaded by aliens and it's up to five teenagers infused with morphing abilities to battle the threat as the Power Rangers. Here's a fun-fact for you all, this ""movie"" is based off the ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" TV series (1993-1995) pilot episode, called ""Day of the Dumpster"". A unique choice for a storyline. I'm not going to clarify anything, but based on the result of this ""film"", it should be renamed ""Dumpster"" instead of ""Power Rangers""! However, that's just scratching the surface, this ""movie"" has a lot of problems. First of all, the tone is completely unbalanced. It doesn't know whether it wants to be serious, or over-the-top. The original ""Power Rangers"" TV series was mostly lighthearted and over-the-top, with some serious moments here and there. That's probably the biggest issue with this ""movie"", it's way too dark and gritty for this concept. Films, or TV shows for that matter, have a line between being dark and realistic, or light and over-the-top. Some movies or shows work better as dark, while some work better as light. Choosing the dark and realistic approach for ""Power Rangers"" was wrong, as it completely detracts from the concept. At some points, I actually forgot I was watching a ""Power Rangers"" film! Bottom line, if you're going to make a movie based on a certain premise, make sure that the tone matches. As for the acting, it's terrible from the majority of the cast! Most of them don't even look like they're trying at all. The best performances come from: Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Watt, RJ Cyler and Jason David Frank. To be honest, Jason David Frank's acting in his short cameo appearance was better than the rest of the acting in this ""film"" as a whole! As far as the soundtrack goes in this ""movie"", it's about as predictable as they come. That was surprising, because the film score was written and composed by Brian Tyler! In most cases, he writes some decent soundtracks for movies! What happened to him here? Now granted, some parts of the film score are okay. But, some parts of it are irritating to listen to. There are some sections of the soundtrack where it just sounds like a cheesy video game! Other than that, the music in this ""movie"" is just not memorable at all Any way, why don't we go ahead and move on to the only two good elements in this piece of trash? The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are cool and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. That being said, they are out-of-place for a movie like this. But, they're still nice to look at though. As far as the special effects go, they are actually very well-done and still hold up today. Which is no surprise, being released in 2017! ""Power Rangers"" is yet another dark adaptation of otherwise lighthearted and over-the-top content that simply does not work. Is it the worst in that category? No, I've seen much worse ones in that regard. I'm struggling to give this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to tell you to avoid this ""film""? No, I think that's pretty obvious. Just stick with the original ""Power Rangers"" TV series instead. All it does is taint the legacy of the ""Power Rangers"" franchise. In this case, it is definitely not morphing time!","

"coltonjc","13 June 2017","This movie has high production standards, by far the best production standards for anything Power Rangers or Super Sentai ever. Secondly, everyone on screen does a great job with their characters. The kids in the movie are fantastic actors who will have many big projects in the future.There are scenes that are intended for teens rather than kids, but if you can get over that and just enjoy the movie, you will be pleased. They are looking for a 15-35 demographic here.The main issue is that there is a lack of memorable scenes and the movie needed more action spots. Maybe even dug a little deeper into the mythology behind the Power Rangers. Explain why they exist and who the dangerous people in this world is.I believe the studio and producers were thinking that this would be an origin story and there would be many movies. But it did not do that well at the box office. New ideas are needed, maybe even doing a little more over the top stuff from the TV series. Something is missing here, which is why it got a 7 out of 10 for me. There's so many places that future movies can get to, but not sure if we will get sequels.","

"smetin","24 March 2017","When this movie got announced, I was immediately excited. I hadn't watched Power Rangers since I was maybe 10 years old. I still remember coming downstairs on a Sunday morning to watch it. The original movie also sticks in my mind as one of my favourites in my youth. This movie had a lot riding on it, considering so many people like myself would watch this purely for nostalgia's sake.The movie starts in typical Power Rangers style: with some action in a jokey style. As the plot progresses you begin to meet characters who you know will become Power Rangers. They are introduced well and are given a fairly decent backstory, most of which you learn as the movie progresses. I felt as though I knew a little about each of the Rangers before they morphed, although most of it was somewhat of a cliché.I thoroughly enjoyed the training segments, along with the introduction of alpha-5 and Zordon. It really took me back to my childhood, but with a modern spin that I felt was not too drastically different from the original. The villain in this movie was creepy though. Far creepier than she was in the original. I can see why this film was given a slightly more mature rating, because I can see how it would not be suitable for younger children. In this sense, I am slightly annoyed as Power Rangers is in essence a children's thing. By giving it a more mature slant to appeal to the masses, you are depriving the true target audience. But that is just my opinion. It is only in the last 45 minutes where the true action begins and we see our characters morph for the first time. The new suits look awesome and I was impressed with the fighting sequences. When the Zords came into play I actually got goosebumps. The ""Go Go Power Rangers"" song playing the background may have been what caused this, because I truly felt like a kid again. It was great. The final battle scene was excellent; you certainly get enough bang for your buck here!In summation, this is certainly a film worth seeing amidst all the superhero films currently our there. If you are of my generation then I urge you to see this in the cinema, rather than watch it on DVD/Blu-Ray/digital later on. The big screen in addition to the Dolby surround surround sound made this an experience I am so happy to have had.","

"mwcrunner","24 March 2017","Excellent here. Very excellent indeed. Just totally awesome. I even like this Power Rangers movie better then the one I've seen as a kid. Looking at the old Power Rangers movie now it's kind of goofy and quirky. This Power Rangers movie however had everything Power Rangers has, except of course Goldar was a giant metamorphosis of gold without that wolf like face. lol. Also Rita Repulsa is way more evil in this then she is in the actual show, since she was just a character swiped from an old Japanese show. lol. Also the Blue Ranger is my favorite. Always has been and always will be. The Megazord in this was wickedly awesome too. We also get to see a cameo of Kimberly and Tommy from the original series. This film had a great cast too. Bryan Cranston as Zordon even. I also like Alpha 5 in this better then him in the old show, cause the old Alpha is kind of dorky. Also Elizabeth Banks was fantastic as Rita Repulsa. It's also nice to see Zordon having a backstory of when he was a Power Ranger. I also know there's gonna be a sequel to this cause we all saw Tommy's jacket at the end. Also the Putties were more intimidating in this then they were in the original show. Yep this movie has everything the Power Rangers should have. Plenty of action, adventure, laughs and pure of heart. 10 out of 10 for this.","

"rockman182","13 June 2017","I still remember watching Fox Five as a kid and for the first time seeing the series premiere of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. I was amazed as a five year old seeing this show and instantly got hooked. The first Power Rangers movie was a film that definitely defined my childhood. It was instantly quotable and campy fun. When I heard about this film I had zero hopes. I haven't kept up with the show beyond the first two or three seasons as a kid and expected a reboot for the film and franchise to be a failing venture. I was actually surprised that this film was actually entertaining. There were many problems with it but I think the origin story was done quite well.The film follows five teenagers who band together one night and discover mysterious power coins at an old mining site. They soon discover these coins are responsible for giving them superhero powers. They soon discover an ancient alien spaceship where they are grouped by Zordon to become the Power Rangers and stop an ancient Green Ranger who turned rogue named Rita Repulsa. Rita is trying destroy the planet and is in search for a crystal that will do so. She's also harboring the towns gold to create a giant gold monster named Goldar.First off, the film took some liberties with the characters. Rita is now a former ranger who lost their way and Goldar is a gigantic and destructive creature (rather than the buffoon follower of Rita in the series). We also learn much about Zordon's origins. The rangers also are more socially updated. One of the rangers is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, and another ranger is a lesbian. They also shifted things around (finally changed the Black Ranger being Black!) None of this was problematic and was actually fairly entertaining.The film does suffer from too much inactivity where the characters try to bond together and find themselves to morph into their armored ranger selves. The main battle also is a bit disappointing as I felt it was a little too anti-climactic. Still, This exceeded my very low expectations. I don't see a sequel coming despite the film setting up for it, the film was a major box office disappointment. Oh yeah, look out for some special cameos.6.5/10","

"LloydBayer","22 March 2017","You know Hollywood is running out of ideas when a hallmark TV series is made into a big screen production, and then recycled and redecorated with a bigger budget for a new generation. That's perfectly acceptable with franchises like the Jurassic Park films, where sequels are released every decade or so and aimed at a specific cluster of the audience. Power Rangers, on the other hand, has no idea who its target audience is and here's probably why: a suit from Lionsgate (yes, Lionsgate) green- lit the reboot even as the TV series is still being aired, hired screenwriters who wrote superhero films like X-Men: First Class and producers from the Transformers franchise, then hired unknown actors and a newbie director before ending up with a PG-13 fiasco that's neither here nor there. At just over 120 minutes, it's highly unlikely this film will grab and hold the attention of children, whereas anyone over 40 expecting a glorious heist or scandalous bachelor party is in for the wrong film. This leaves us with older teens widely known as the YA crowd (young adults). Now here's the caveat: Back in the early '90s, superheroes films were limited to one-off appearances a year. 25 years later and there are no less than five superhero films a year (this year we have six including one animation) from stalwart studios with an ever increasing budget and fan base. Yet as a superhero origins film, the new Power Rangers film simply doesn't stack up to the expectations of the general audience, let alone teenagers who expect nothing but cutting edge effects in a mega bucks franchise. So while lacking a target audience, the bigger question is why a reboot after more than 20 years? Cashing in on the current superhero culture seems like an obvious motive, but the disparity in production quality is even more obvious from the opening scene right through to the end. Except for some campy moments from Elizabeth Banks as a gold digging alien witch (How's Rita Repulsa for camp?) there is no other character worth caring about, not even the titular high school misfits who discover extraordinary abilities but are too dumb to figure out their purpose as a team of intergalactic warriors. Sadly, Power Rangers turns out to be a cinematic misfire that should have gone straight to TV. But even then, titles from Netflix and Amazon Studios far outweigh this debacle whose only purpose appears to be a disappearing act in your wallet.","

"phanthinga","25 March 2017","Back in the late 90s when im just a small boy the biggest piece of entertainment for kids in my country is the Power Rangers series and later on is the Super Sentai series the original root from Japan.I still remember how thrill and exciting i was when coming home and immediately turn on the TV to catch the latest episode then re watch it the next day waiting for the new episode to come out.Because i watch the both the series back to back so my memories with them is very strong and it still follow me to my teenage years.When i first hear the news that they gonna make a live-action Power Rangers movie some part of me just turn into a child again but it also make me very nervous because i know if their want to deliver a Power Rangers movie that not only give the old fan a trip down to memories lane but also make more new fan is not to taken this movie seriously and keep all the part that make what Power Rangers is today.For my surprise after watching this movie today im very please to say that they has did a great job with this one.Apart from the main storyline we already know is Power Rangers is about a group of teenager being chosen to hold a strong power help them turn into a kind of superheroes that each has a different color and each one of them has to working together as a team to save the earth from the force of evil.The thing that make this movie so much better than the movie came out in 1995 is how much good the characters being told in this movie.They all have their own problem with school and life so when we see their come together and exposed themselves it very great and heart warming at the time,i don't know what you guys think but the krispy kreme thing is hilarious.Other important characters is also portray very well but the best for me is Zordon voice by Bryan Cranston and Rita Repulsa played by Elizabeth Banks.Both of them did a fantastic job on portray how over the top and chessy their characters is although they did change some aspect of the Rita character but it not annoy me much so i kinda pass on that.The big problem with this movie is how before the epic climax the movie already a good teenage drama but all of that get blow away when they first morph into the suit and fight Rita.I find the last big action scene rather tame and a little bit letdown when the first fight with megazord is not only very unsatisfied but also very frustrated because for some reason they decide to turn Goldar a very beloved bad guy of the original series into a big crappy CGI monster literally make from gold.Still recommend this movie to everyone but don't bring high hope to this","

"stemelia21","24 February 2020","Right ok its not the best film ever made but it wasn't the worst either. However it's a film about the power rangers! How good is it going to be.The nostalgic fun was awesome. I used to watch the power rangers back in the early 90s when I was about 9 years old, it was the best thing ever. If I was that age now I'd be giving it a 10/10. A pretty good casting and they hit all the right spots with the action. Still dont understand why the blue ranger drowned in 20 seconds but other than that things made sense and there was lot of comparisons to the original. They included the original ""go go power rangers"" song which was awesome. I would be lying if I said I didnt get a little bit excited about the mega Zord.Give it 6/10. I was going to be 5/10 but the mega Zord and the original theme song pushed the score up a bit. Give it a watch it ain't bad and at the very worst it'll transport you back to your childhood for a couple of hours .","

"ActionMovieDude","22 March 2017","Before I review the film, lets go back to the beginning of the awful television show.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers started airing on Fox Kids. Its true genesis was as an Americanized version of a long running Japanese kids show called Super Sentai which premiered back in 1975.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (with its bad 1990s haircuts, fashion, and earrings) merged original Japanese footage from two Super Sentai shows called Zyuranger and Dairanger with absolutely horrid American footage that was a bad Saved By The Bell knock off which eventually joined Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as the latest craze on Fox Kids. The third season, which ripped off Kakuranger, had the power rangers turned into children and replaced by ""ninja"" aliens. (Are you kidding me?!)Fast forward to 2017. Power Rangers has lost most of its former popularity, so greedy plagiarist Haim Saban decides to reboot ""his"" power rangers (which was never ""his"" in the first place, it belonged to Toei who originally created Super Sentai/power rangers) the same way Ninja Turtles was ""rebooted"" for the big screen a couple of years ago.This time, the new cast is completely dysfunctional and the first 90 minutes are a real DRAG ripping off other teen angst movies so much that many kids will undoubtedly find it BORING. (Which they did in my screening!) Its far more Chronicle/Fant4stic than power rangers.Elizabeth Banks is the only one doing decent work as the new Rita Repulsa, a former Power Ranger looking to revive her giant monster Goldar. Even Bryan Cranston is miscast and looks lost here as Zordon!The ending does finally bring the audience its goofy power rangers (in the last ten minutes!) with even more ridiculous plastic costumes than the cheesy Zyuranger spandex on the old show and bargain basement, combining video game CGI visual effects for the end battle which really DOES looks like another Playstation 2 game.The word CHEESE cannot describe how eye rolling and preposterous the ending is. (A megazord slap into outer space PUL-EEZZE)!Not to mention the endless Krispy Kreme references/placements are downright embarrassing.Do the world a favor watch a far superior comic book movie like Logan instead and save your money!Power rangers was a HUGE disappointment, its poor box office worldwide proves it. (A sequel is VERY unlikely now!)A one on a scale of 1-10.Power Rangers is another box office BOMB for Lionsgate, which was on a roll after the great John Wick sequel.","

"devildog-80597","13 June 2017","OK, so this movie has a pretty good rating but it's even better if you take the time to read the reviews and see that the majority of the negative reviews are from 90's kids who are fans of their PR and honestly think the poor effects, bad writing and horrible acting from the 90's was good, not just for the 90s but for now. They are only upset because it makes their PRs look bad. And all of the other bad reviews are from religious nuts who don't like the very subtle reference that might mean the Yellow Power Ranger may be questioning her sexuality. Not once did they say it but the reviews would have you believe animals are having sex, kids are doing drugs and gay porn is taking place throughout the film, which it isn't. I'd wager that most of the negative reviews never saw the movie. This movie was good with special effects, background story, acting and more. It wasn't Oscar worthy, don't get me wrong but it was fun, action, sci-fi movie. If you like the original Power Rangers and think they are the best then don't watch this. If you want a fun and exciting movie to watch then definitely load this up.","

"Wizard-8","29 September 2018","I will give this cinematic adaptation of the popular 90s kids television show this: it is somewhat less annoyingly juvenile in tone as the television show. And the young actors who play the title characters show likability and talent. However, even their charm and efforts can't save the movie in the end, for the reasons I stated in the subject line of this user comment.Let me explain. As I said, I found the movie too slow. If you are expecting a lot of Power Ranger action, you'll be very disappointed. The build-up to when the rangers get into action takes forever, about 3/4 of the running time. And when the rangers DO get into action, the mayhem feels slower, clunkier, and more awkward than the action on the television show.Strangely, the movie is also way too fast at times. There are a ton of plot points that are not defined clearly, or are forgotten about and never brought up again. Also, the villain of the movie (Rita Repulsa) is given almost no development at all, making her a really weak and colorless figure. There are signs that despite the length of this movie (124 minutes), a LOT of footage that might have fleshed out the story and characters was ultimately cut out in the editing room.Adults who liked the Power Rangers as kids will probably be let down by this movie. Kids might like the movie better, but will probably outgrow it when exposed to better movie later. I say for either age group, stick to reruns of the television show.","

"larry-degala","10 May 2017","If Saban is going to spend $100 million on ""Power Rangers"", why did Dean Israelite only make $135 million back in the box office? ""Transformers"" made $708 million in 2007. The producers had a strong film budget, so what could possibly go wrong? Watch the midpoint on ""Transformers"" and the midpoint on ""Power Rangers."" I won't spoil it for you. You might get a good hint. Josh Trank of ""Chronicle"" could have done a better job. He made $168 million over his $126 million tent pole ""Fantastic Four"" in 2015. At least he made $42 million over the measly $35 million. Granted that Josh Trank and Dean Israelite are not Michael Bay, Joseph Kahn (another Generation X-er) made a superior version that was mature and well-developed, with chemistry and heart, and a intertwined story line that pulled the audience in, wanting for more. It had action like ""The Matrix"" with gritty drama like SyFy's ""Battlestar Galactica"". I felt his version moved the franchise forward from the small screen to the big. However, the trend is to hire Millennial filmmakers over Generation X filmmakers for budgets over $100 million because (and I quote) ""Millennials can only relate to Millennials."" Really? I mean REALLY? Forgot about Good Story-telling? Hello??!! It is not about one generation relating to another generation. Alfred Hitchcock even kicks butt in the post Millennial era. And so another franchise died as quickly as ""The Last Airbender."" Saban, try again please. Take my Alexander Hamiltons from these dying hands!","

"Nintendo600","24 March 2017","Power Rangers was an easy 2 hours of my life and $22.95 ill never get back. Origin stories tend to be good, and also sometimes not so good. This one falls into the latter, with a solid 75% of the film setting up the final 20 minutes of the film and leaving the main villain who is very two-dimensional (not to mention Elizabeth Banks' terrible, terrible fake accent, sorry). With bad narrative, an unfinished and poorly written script/dialogue, there really isn't to go off.Some characters and series' are very outdated, (Superman, Green Lantern, majority of DC and their cartoon costumes that were bad enough in the 40's) unfortunately, Power Rangers is just one that belongs and needs to stay buried in the 90's. Seeing those costumes and hearing ""its morphin' time"" in the mid to late 2010's just sounds awfully outdated. PW has had its time, hopefully Lionsgate will be more smarter not to continue this franchise and ruin the memory many of us millennials had of the suited heroes.","

"jackwarner999","21 March 2017","I was one of the first people to be asked to watch power rangers in December of 2016. I went into the theater not expecting much from this movie but I was wrong, it was a good movie. Not great or OK it was simply good. It had great CGI and the acting was good for a young cast. I loved the first 2 acts of the movie they were really strong and had good story telling. But act 3 in my opinion seemed silly and sort of rushed. The first 2 acts were great because of 2 things. Great characters and a steady pace. The character development was great and I liked how the writers really stuck to making them interesting so that the audience would care about them, especially RJ Cylers character. Nothing was rushed and was going at a great pace and then all of a sudden act 3 came into play and it turned into a mediocre action film and wasn't very exciting and I believe that is due to the villain. I was not a fan. Her motives are too over used and simply a lame character. The actress was fine but the character it'self wasn't anything special and made the action scenes dull. Other than that the kids will love it and if you are a power ranger fan I think you will be pleased. It's fun for the whole family.","

We have Bryan Cranston as a sort of mentor figure to our lead group. And that group is of course unwilling at first. I have to admit here, that I have not seen previous installments of the Power Rangers, so I can't really compare. Even cameos from previous Power Rangers would have gone over my head, if they hadn't been pointed out to me.So there is stuff to look forward to, but it all is very easy going. It's predictable as expected, the CGI gets better every year and it's good in this one, although there's always room for improvement. Watch it, just don't expect too much","

"mizavila","9 July 2017","Apparently none of you remember the original series or the reboot shows following being just as ""cheesy"" as some of you say. I'm a 80s baby that grew up watching this show and now have babies of my own who watch the ""Original"" power rangers as well as the reboot shows. All of these shows have that cheesy feel to it but it's what made us all love it and still do. You all are just hating so bad on this movie because these kids don't fit your expectations of what a power ranger should be from the beginning. The directors are trying to tell a different story, yes in the beginning these kids did some bad things & made bad choices. But they start to realize what it is become a true power ranger. Who go from selfish teenage misfits to teenage kids who care about the world and saving their home and the planet. And the sexuality you all are crying about don't remember the original movie where Kimberly practically threw herself at Jason every chance she got & then there was Dulcea who was an almost half naked woman. Yet I see no one pointy that out. Oh that's right its because this is 2017 & a little sexual jokes is like someone just walked around fully naked down the road. So those that ""followed"" the show from the beginning as well as the remakes, should be maybe re watch those movies and shows & realize that this movie is not as bad as you all make it seem.","

The character development was a real surprise since in the original Power Rangers series, that didn't exactly exist. There's a good blend of cheesiness that fans that watched MMPR grew up with as well as solid storytelling to make for a great time. If you go into this expecting for a purist Xerox of what you watched growing up, you'll be disappointed. But if you go into this with an open mind looking to have a fun time, you won't be disappointed. I was very impressed with the overall performances of the entire cast especially Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa and RJ Cyler as Billy. Fans of the franchise and even those who didn't bother to care for it before should watch this. It's a very fun film that makes you feel like a kid again.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","12 March 2020","This gritty reboot of 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (1993-1999)' has a bit of a tonal problem. 'Power Rangers (2017)' can't decide if it wants to be a dulled-down, hard-edged action movie or a bright, tongue-in-cheek throwback piece. This is disconcerting, to say the least. I mean, the picture has both a 'Transformers (2007)'-esque, teamwork-focused ending and a subplot about the non-consensual sharing of a teenager's 'nude pics' (perpetrated by a hero, no less). There are jokes about space robots, super powers and accidentally 'pulling off' a bull, scenes centred around outlandish stunts, combat training and the murder of innocent civilians, and references to pop-culture, power rangers and the bullying of an autistic child. I think you get the point. It's just so all over the place, at once deadly serious and incredibly silly, and it doesn't always seem to know which 'mode' it's currently in. On the positive side, the focal team is comprised of a diverse set of decently developed characters; no-one is left out due to race, gender, sexuality, disability or personal baggage. The finale is also surprisingly effective, especially - I suppose - for a big CG-based battle. It's not great but it's entertaining enough. I'll also add that Banks' Rita Repulsa feels like she's walked straight out of the 90s show. It's just a shame that only a few oblique callbacks follow her. For most of the movie, I was honestly cringing. It's generic, banal and forced, bland in the blandest of ways. Don't get me wrong, it's basically passable. I just don't know who it's for, really. It's too grown-up for kids but too flawed for adults. Its best bit is when the teens finally come together, draped in their technicolor armour, and deliver the colourful kung-fu cheesiness that most people expect with the brand. Unfortunately, this only lasts for about two minutes. 5/10","

They never become real friends, let alone work as a squad, they just try and fail at it.And about the ""Power"" side, there's nothing to differentiate the various colors, the Rangers have no personal weapons or special abilities to define them.None of them does anything cool, througout the movie, they're not good at fighting, thinking, or even driving their Zords, and when it comes to the Megazord, it looks like some crappy Transformer, with no resemblance with the Zords that should be his parts, and, guess what, it has no special weapon or special attack AT ALL! (So they win for no apparent reason)Zordon seems like a selfish, disturbed AI like Hal 9000 (from 2001 A Space Odissey) which the Rangers can't trust, and Alpha is up to no good either

"BrBaFett","24 March 2017","I grew up a die-hard Power Ranger fan. I thought at first it was cheezy with the story behind the Power Rangers, Zordon once the Red Ranger and the fictional language that was being spoken. Liked the idea of detention, but I feel they could've done better introducing the Rangers before hand. Wasn't high on the casting choices either; my favourite was RJ Cyler as Billy because I think he portrayed it so well, liked the version of Trini, but still think casting could've been better. Didn't like the version of Rita Repulsa because in the show Rita is a witch with a team of villains, but all she has from them in this movie is-- literally--GOLDar... which is probably what else made me mad. Alpha, I could live with, kinda liked that version. But still wish they had the actual Command Center as a headquarters. Like Bryan Cranston as Zordon was awesome. But later towards the end is where I started to tear up. I liked their morphing sequence--that was my favourite part of the entire show. Then after seeing the zords was just unbelievably awesome while playing the Power Rangers theme song. If you watch the show, you'll understand these 100%. I liked how they had all the Power Ranger cameos, such as Jason's dad saying, 'Mariner Bay and Reefside.' Old ficitonal cities from the TV show in other seasons: my jaw dropped. The fight scenes with the zords and Goldar were so well done, just would've rather seen a megazord transformation and although was impressed with the morphing sequence, I wish they did it better. I cried towards the end when I saw (Jason David Frank and Amy Jo Johnson) Tommy and Kimberly's cameo, then seeing after the credits hearing the name 'Tommy Oliver,' my mind officially went super positive. Overall I loved it, even though there were some things that bother me. But this is a valuable review because I am a die-hard Power Rangers fan. Take my word for it.","

"Justin_Shanahan","25 March 2017","Yes, it is very different from the original but bares some similarities. I didn't like the zords that much, only because they look extremely different. I couldn't tell if the black ranger was driving a mastodon, or some unknown creature zord. The zords were hard to recognize. I like that it is all modern, but at least make the zords recognizable and the suits. Don't get me wrong, the suits were nice, and I did like them a lot, but I wish they were more recognizable. I thought Elizabeth Banks did a great job. She did play a villain role well and I'd like to see more of that. Although, I was disappointed that she was in green clothing. She is bringing Rita to a new level and that is good. At least she had Goldar with her. He was updated, nothing wrong with that but at least have him talk and have a face. The putties were good, again, you couldn't tell what they were. What I am trying to say is that changes are always good, and I am all for it, but if you're going to update a character or zords for that matter, at least make it recognizable. Like the Mighty Morphen Power Ranger Movie back in the 90's were updated but recognizable. It really does suck that her goons weren't in the movie and speaking of goons, I'm sad that they didn't have Bulk and Skull. Just like Rita and Goldar, they will always be apart of the Power Ranger universe. It just wasn't the same without them. Alpha's voice should of stood the same, seeing as he was Alpha 5. Again, there was a lot of changes to the film vs The Original.The sound effects were good. The music was good. I hope to see more of the morphin sequences and Zords transforming into the Megazord. Overall, this film is good and I am gonna watch it again.","

Washed out are all of the things that made kids gravitate towards Power Rangers leaving behind a hollow product that bares its name. In place of all of the things that gave Power Rangers its distinction, costume designs, set pieces, music and intense action is now generic fluff and bland characters. No kid who sees this for the first time is gonna fall in love with it like they did the original show.They blew it. They had the opportunity to make something that could stand on its own against big robot movies like The Transformers or superhero ensembles like The Avengers but now won't even be noticed alongside these movies. And while to this day people will remember Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, they have already forgotten about this movie when leaving the theater.Do yourselves a favour, instead of watching this, Youtube ''Megazord Dragonzord team up'' and see something really cool.P.S.

The mian five actors that played the power rangers all played them well and I thought were well cast. Naomi scott as kimberly being one of my favourites. But.dacre montgomoery, dj.cyler ludi lin and becky g were overall pretty good. Bill hader as the voice of alpha five and bryan cranston as zordon were also good. The action was pretty good and the plot that leas them to being the power rangers was interesting enough. The only thing id say is I wish the cgi was better but overall it was still a pretty good film.","

"cruise01","25 March 2017","A group of five troubled high school students discovering some power coins turning them into Power Rangers. I have never seen the original TV series and vaguely remember seeing the 1995 movie which was cool for its time but cheesy now and looking like a very low budget version of an nickelodeon movie. Dean Israelite film on this Power Rangers adaptation is a lot of fun seeing these students get together from their troubled past and form a team. The modern take is a blockbuster fun type of film that follows the cliché origin story and have a better looking armor suits with the rangers, some cheesy humor, and visual effects. Like most origin stories, the plot follows these five high school students who all cross paths in detention. Jason (Dacre Montgomery) a high school football player that got into a wreck after a prank gone bad. Billy (RJ Cyler) a smart awkward student in trouble for blowing up a locker. Kimberly (Naomi Scott) who got into trouble for punching the ex boyfriend. They all run into each other in the mountains, including Trini (Becky G) who is having trouble fitting in, and Zack (Ludi Lin) a teen that is arrogant but also has a soft side taking care of his sick mother in a trailer park. They all discover these alien coins that gives them superhuman strength and abilities. Making them Power Rangers. As a threat nears when Rita (Elizabeth Banks) is preparing to summon her army to unleash a weapon that can wipe everyone on Earth. Even though the film does follow the origin formula. It is a lot of fun seeing these five teens trying to coop on what has been holding them back and seeing them cooperate with the other. Even in the second act, when they are all at a campfire, sharing there troubled past. Also, seeing these five characters learning from Zordon (Bryan Cranston) who was once the leader of his team of power rangers. These characters learn what they have to become. You get to see these characters become the power rangers and morph into their armor a little late in the movie like the last half hour as they fight against Rita's army. It is great to see these characters develop in the movie, which is a lot of fun. The action sequence was fun. Seeing the power rangers operating their own Zords (robotic vehicles). And a battle with Goldar (a giant golden monster) and the Megazord that the rangers morphed into. The action picks up in the climax with destruction and fighting. The visual effects were nothing to brag about which was okay. The humor was cheesy when it came to dialogue or a plot device that centered it at a krispy kreme building. Even, seeing Rita waiting at the donut shop and eating a donut during the climax. Yet again, Power Rangers is supposed to be family fun. I love the cast talent that I would hope to see these actors grow further into their characters in sequels.Overall, Power Rangers is a lot of fun; it has character development, exciting action sequences, great cast, and cheesy humor, which you can expect, in this type of film. I would rate Power Rangers 4 out of 5 stars.","

"TheJediWay9","23 March 2017","""Power Rangers: The No-One-Gives-A-S#!t Edition"" is directed by Dean Isrealite on a screenplay from John Gatins, Mark Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Kieran & Michelle Mulroney and focuses on a group of teenagers who are screw ups. They are outcasts in their school and society until they stumble upon these power coins and a spaceship and its there that they learn they are a new generation of Power Rangers.I was born in 1994 and was quite familiar with the Power Rangers when I was a kid. Whenever they were on TV, these were the superheroes my brother and I looked up to. Watching the god-awful but somehow hilariously bad ""Might Morphin Power Rangers"" movie from 1997 where every time they kick a monster into a wall it explodes into purple goo (no joke) from a very young age somehow told me that I wanted to be a Power Ranger. then I grew up, the Power Rangers weren't popular anymore, and now I am in college.Enter 2017, where studios try to make everything a ""thing"" now, and that is the case with this movie. I had a slimmer of hope that this movie would be good. And if it wasn't good, I was hoping it would at least be enjoyable in that fun, cheesy, goofy, entertaining type way that the show was back in the 90s.I'm not gonna lie: for the first two-thirds of this movie, I found what I was watching fairly enjoyable. Was it ground-breaking? No. It seemed like they were going to finally get a Power Rangers movie right for the first time. I was supporting these characters the whole way. There's a scene in the middle of the movie where they have a heart-to-heart with one another, and that scene actually provided some nice character depth and backstory for those characters whose backstory was completely glossed over at the beginning of the film. All of the actors playing the Power Rangers were also really good. Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Dacre Montgomery, Becky G, and Ludi Line. all five of them did a good job in their roles. The movie really hinged on them and if they ended up sucking, this movie would have been a complete failure.Elizabeth Banks was just a cartoon copy of herself. She was so over the top in such a serious movie that both her plan and her character became stupid after awhile. She was a definition of a cliché villain, showing up only to pose a threat and not really do much and then be at the center of the final throw down. Bryan Cranston as Zordon... pretty good actually.Aside from Elizabeth Banks, everything leading up to the climatic showdown was actually pretty enjoyable. Watching the Power Rangers train was actually pretty cool, and seeing them stumble upon their Zords for the first time was quite the site. But then the third act happened, and it completely derailed the movie. Everything leading up to the point at the beginning of the third act where a Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became a plot device was fairly good. Once this plot device is introduced, that and everything after it is a complete waste of time. It's all bad. There's nothing good about the third act of this movie. Sure you have the Power Rangers kicking ass, that's what we all wanted to see, but it looked really sloppy. This movie fell into the habit of having its action scenes filmed in what I like to call ""Slow-Fast-Mo,"" which is a style that was cool ten years ago for one movie then everyone started doing it and it began to suck. Things in this third act happen that don't make any sense. How are they flying their Zords if they haven't flown them before? The special effects are really terrible. The CGI looked like it came from a Playstation 2 game's cut scenes, and of course there's a giant monster....that they have to fight...and it's gold... and gigantic. There was nothing exciting about this fight. I didn't care about this small town and whether or not it got destroyed. It's in the middle of frigging nowhere. It's strange to think that this movie is fairly enjoyable for the first two acts and makes you believe that you are watching a good movie. Once that third act pops up though, it really just becomes what the TV show was. Bad. But unlike the TV show and the 1997 movie, this was bad in bad way.I am going to give ""Power Rangers"" a 4.2/10.Check out my video review of ""Power Rangers"" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=ckFQeFdsIv0&t=25s","

"quincytheodore","22 March 2017","Join five teenagers as they embark on overly complex origin story, staggering change in directional tone, intense product placement and awkward usage of nostalgia. The hectic mess is not without its charm, the team is, at the very least, likable with more personality than transforming robot movies in recent time had, though it's not a high achievement. The best thing one could say about this reboot is it could've been so much worse.Origin story isn't the most novel idea, but it has become a necessity as of late, especially for a reboot. The Rangers undergo a series of exposition, mainly taking serious direction from other superhero themed movie Chronicle, but also translating the corny style from its original television show. It tells both the story of apocalypse and also abundance of jokes, and then it veers into the realm of heavy personal issues.The sudden shift is felt so many times that the movie feels like a robot piloted by several people. However, it's not without charm or humor. The cast might feel bizarrely put together at fight, but they do have their moments. This provides a little bit of bravado and less vanilla than the original show. If anything, they are limited only by the fantasy troupes which may seem predictable or campy, then again this is Power Rangers, not Logan.It has one edge over other superhero movies; the product placement. The trend has been done for years, but Power Rangers take it to the next level. For action, humanoid and robotic, it mostly stays true to the original source, including poses and jingles. This does feel like an afternoon show with the ad and spark of nostalgia.Many have complained that superhero movies are too gritty or too corny, Power Rangers is both, often at the same time. This is clearly not an advantage as it would have fared much better sticking to the light humor or heavy personal struggle. Still, for a movie based on 90s children show, it offers mild indulgent and barely avoids being a total disaster.","

"mammadova-52647","17 June 2017","It is a good movie with great special effects. Very good acting and well written. The movie starts off good with character development and ends great with fight seen. Was one of my favorite shows as a kid and was very happy with this movie.

"DBLurker","29 June 2017","Instead of creating any new unique characters, they went for same old PC garbage with generic character templates. Not a single interesting Power Ranger but I guess for Hollywood, being ""lesbian"" or gay these days is interesting enough. The actors are god-awful, especially the Chinese guy.The fact is, we used to watch the show as kids because of creatures and fighting, not because of generic Power Rangers (PRs) as normal humans since they had a personality of a potato. You'd think that a movie focusing so much on normal PRs would come up with better characters than generic troubled teens with autism and lesbianism as their special power (when no in suits).The worse part is that the action is so.. boring. The creatures they fight are so awful that most of the time you don't even care that the creatures exist (funny enough, creatures have same level of personality as the PRs). Then there is the terrible Goldan special effect and hilariously awful Rita. In shows, Rita was just crazy fun, overacted and funny. Here? She's trying to be serious and all sinister and it's just so cringe-worthy seeing the actress trying to act that way.Coming back to special effects. They are just terrible. Robots look like they are made of plastic, Goldan looks like terrible pre-rendered CGI from those old PS2 CGI before the games. Everything looks so fake and considering how fake the PRs shows looked, this is just amazing. At least in shows you can suspend disbelief knowing the limitation of a budget.. here? They spent $100 million dollars on this garbage CGI with robots that look like plastic toys.Anyway, there is going to be a sequel apparently. Maybe they'll spend time more on action than ""OMG I AM LESBIAN MY PARENTS DON'T UNDERS-HI I AM AUTISTIC!"".","

"zkonedog","25 March 2017","""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" was the first television show I remember being totally mesmerized by. I was ""of the perfect age"" (8-10) when the show aired, and it was seemingly all- consuming in my life. So, when some 25 years later I heard that a new Power Rangers movie was hitting theaters, I knew I'd be front and center opening weekend (nostalgia is a powerful force). What I didn't know is if it would be any good, or if this remake would be butchered in any number of ways. Fortunately, ""Power Rangers"" was better than it really should have any right to have been.For a basic plot summary, ""Power Rangers"" tell the story of how a group of five ""teenagers with attitude""--Jason (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly (Naomi Scott), Billy (RJ Cyler), Zack (Ludi Lin), & Trini (Becky G.)--find five mysterious colored coins hidden in a rock quarry. The coins give each of them superhuman abilities, and they soon discover that they are humanities only hope in fighting up with the forces of evil, more specifically Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) and her plot to destroy Angel Grove and the world with it. On the side of the five Rangers are Zordon (Bryan Cranston) the disembodied sage, and his robot sidekick Alpha 5 (Bill Hader).Here's the thing that I think everyone should keep in mind when analyzing this movie: In order for it to truly be ""Power Rangers"", it has to appeal to kids just as much as myself (the nostalgia- fueled audience). This film does an excellent job of doing both of those things. While I'm usually rather annoyed at kids chattering in the theater, I can make an exception for this film, as it was fun to hear the little ones' reactions to the entire experience. I have a strong feeling that if you watch this film as a 7-10 year old today, you'll leave thinking it is ""the best movie you've ever seen"". This was ESSENTIAL in the success of the film.There are also quite a few ""easter eggs"" (lines, visuals, cameos, etc.) for the ""old nostalgics"" like myself. While I may never be able to quite experience that sheer joy of being 8-10 again and watching in complete wonder, I was at least able to recapture some of that glory this time around. The film hews pretty true to the original ""Mighty Morphin"" storyline, just adding a few little wrinkles here and there. It's fun seeing the five teens both in and out of the suits, Cranston is a great Zordon, and Banks is quite entertaining as well. It is quite clear that Haim Saban and his production crew took great care to make sure this one stayed true to the spirit of the original.Only helping matters is director Dean Israelite, who really impressed me by helming ""Project Almanac"", another teen-driven vehicle that turned into a very entertaining flick. Building a movie around teens can be tricky (many pitfalls and tropes to avoid), but Israelite really seems to have a handle on that craft.Now, is ""Power Rangers"" a bit cheesy and predictable/straightforward. Sure. ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" was the most cheesy and predictable show ever made! One has to just expect that going in. Even at the very top of its game, this material will never be given any major awards or anything like that. I think the thing that matters, though, is that this won't matter to kids at all, as they will be able to take the material completely at face value (much like I did at that age).Overall, then, I enjoyed the experience of re-living my youth and seeing ""Power Rangers"" up on the big screen once again! I saw the film with a younger sibling who knew little of the franchise, and she liked it just as much as me, so it really has to be doing something right in that regard. There is also almost unlimited potential for sequels spinning off from this effort, with something to that effect even teased in a post-credits scene. So, whether you are a 30-something looking to recapture a fleeting glimpse of youth or a kid being wowed by the Rangers for the first time, there will be something in this movie for you.","

"niggor92","26 March 2017","I saw lots of reviews for this movie, I guess most of those people are real Power Rangers fans. And i still can't realize: WHAT THE **** DID YOU EXPECT?!This is a REBOOT. A completely new story, just like director said. This is the first movie in a new superhero franchise, and it needs to have a focus on the story and its characters, not on battles and morphing sequences. It's made for everybody except kids, because it's dark and much more serious than the TV show which was made mostly for kids. We have five teenagers and each of them has his own issues he needs to solve himself in order to become a hero (Power Ranger) and save the world. Every next situation in the movie makes our heroes closer to each other and stronger as a team.I personally enjoyed watching this movie because it is dark, amazing, emotional, funny(of course not that much like the TV show), and has AWESOME introduction to the whole story and its main characters. I can only imagine what's planned for the sequel. CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT!!! #GO #GO #POWER #RANGERS","

"TheLastPersonStanding","23 March 2017","When I was a kid, I was into ""Power Rangers"", like probably many other kids in the '90s. I eventually lost interest in it, though. I only saw this film because a friend emailed me free passes to an advanced screening. Many people in the audience seemed to be enjoying it. There was laughing, cheering, and applauding, which is fine, but I simply wasn't one of those people. I don't think I laughed once while watching the film. It's not really boring, but it's not really engaging. The two scenes I enjoyed the most are when the villain Rita is in a jewellery store being weird and the big fight scene with Rita's giant gold monster, which is, of course, near the end.What's the story? Well, I don't feel like writing about the story because I don't care... but I'll write about it, anyway. A bunch of teenagers discover a spaceship or something hidden underground. Inside is Alpha 5, a comical robot who looks kinda like an alien, and Zordon, who appears as a big pixelated face... at least I think it's pixelated. The teenagers have superpowers and have to morph into Power Rangers so they can stop Rita from taking over the world or some crap. It takes awhile until they're all able to morph and you don't see them in their Power Ranger costumes a lot. The Rangers each have their own giant robot creature that they can control while they're inside of them. These creatures are used for the big fight scene and when combined, they become an even bigger robot that's reminiscent of a Michael Bay Transformer. Do the Rangers defeat Rita and her giant gold monster? Duh.The effects are pretty good and the acting is OK, but like I wrote earlier, I didn't care about the story. I also didn't care about the characters. None of them are interesting. Krispy Kreme is involved with the plot, by the way. To me, it's superfluous product placement. I don't know if you'll enjoy this film if you're a Power Rangers fan. It only made me want to rewatch the short film ""Power/Rangers"".","

"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","14 April 2020","In Angel Grove, five teenagers stumble upon an alien ship and meet Zordon and Alpha, a holographic projector who was the former Red Ranger and a robot, who recruits them on a mission to save their world from an evil threat known as Rita Repulsa, the former Green Ranger. They must train and learn to overcome their real life issues in order to do so.After the underperformance of Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, plans for a reboot lasted for over a decade while Power Rangers would continue to receive multiple seasons. Later in 2017, the reboot got released in theaters on March 24 2017 to mixed reviews and became a box office flop due to it's competition against the Beauty and the Beast remake from Disney and Kong: Skull Island from Warner Bros, thus canceling a planned movie franchise.As a person who loves Power Rangers upon growing up watching the series, I felt really bad for this reboot. Yes, it does have problems and it's not a perfect film, but I thought it was fun and entertaining. Not only that, it does honor the history of Power Rangers to those who grew up with it.(Warning, this review does contain some bits of spoilers)The story does a really nice job in expanding on Power Rangers. There's a backstory to Zordon and Alpha and their connection to Rita Repulsa during their battle at the Cenozoic Era which is done very well in the beginning of the film. Also, the Power Rangers group including Jason, Kimberly, Billy, Trini, and Zack have been fleshed out as actual teenagers with attitudes when compared to the non-realistic goody good personalities of the original Mighty Morphin group (which isn't a bad thing mind you as it worked back at 1993, but it's understandable while many people who watched Power Rangers didn't like the Mighty Morphin group as time went by). And most importantly, Rita Repulsa's motivation in this reboot as to why being rejected her Green Ranger powers gives her a reason as to why she's evil and how she plans to conquer the world. Not to mention it references the Zeo Crystal became very relevant to the film's plot as it was supposed to set up future films which became very unlikely due to the film's failure at the box office.That being said, there some other things I liked about the film. The cinematography is very nice as is the look of the Command Center and Angel Grove, the darker tone is very welcomed while not without some bits of humor which for the most part is really hilarious. Also, the look of the Ranger designs is actually pretty good as it retains the same mouth pieces and animal-like helmets while fitting the tone nicely. Brian Tyler's score is riveting. It retains the same ""Go Go Power Rangers"" theme while giving itself it's own identity and gives the intense moments of the film some atmosphere. And last but not least the acting. Bryan Cranston (who voiced the two monsters of the week in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) does a great job as Zordon, Bill Hader is very funny and yet very poignant as Alpha 5, and Elizabeth Banks is great as she gives Rita Repulsa a sense of menace and complexity. The actors who played the Power Rangers also did a good job too. Dacre Montgomery (who would later play Billy Hargrove in Season 2 of Stranger Things), Naomi Scott (who would later play Jasmine in Disney's live action remake of Aladdin), RJ Cyler (who starred in the Scream tv series), Becky G (a singer and guest star from Austin & Ally), and Ludi Linn (from Marco Polo, Aquaman, Black Mirror and the upcoming Mortal Kombat reboot in 2021), shines in their chemistry and like Rita, they also give some complexity as they explain their real life issues with each other thus making them very believable.However, there are some problems that needs to be addressed. First, there's the CGI. Now, I've seen films that have handled the CGI way better, but in this reboot, they look pretty much off especially the look of Zordon and Alpha 5 despite the 100 million dollar budget of the film. Second, the rangers themselves don't morph until the third act of the film which is very disappointing considering the posters. And also, in the third act of the film, the location of the Zeo crystal that was revealed felt pretty dumb to me (go watch the rest of the film and you'll understand why).So, overall, the Power Rangers 2017 reboot isn't perfect and it could've been much stronger, but it's still a fun and entertaining film that respects and honors the history of Power Rangers. It's a shame we didn't get a planned movie franchise since there's another reboot in the works, though. So, to those who haven't seen the film, this might worth watching. :)","

"blazedounal","26 June 2017","I was a fan of the series for years, and I still find the best the first generation, for this movie I was very anxious, and now that I saw it, I can say that I do not exceed my expectations. I only watched Power Rangers a little bit when was younger and was never really into it, but, I got to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I loved it, I think everyone involved did a very good job. There was a good mix of comedy, action, drama and even some sentimental moments.In the Cenozoic-era, six interplanetary warriors, the Power Rangers, are tasked with protecting life on Earth and the Zeo Crystal. The Green Ranger, Rita Repulsa, betrays them and plans to dominate the universe. Red Ranger orders Alpha 5 to perform a meteor strike that kills him and sends Rita to the bottom of the sea, foiling her scheme.In 21st century Angel Grove, high school football star Jason Scott is dismissed from the team and placed under house arrest after a failed prank. In school detention, he defends Billy from a bully, Billy offers to deactivate Jason's ankle monitor for help at an old gold mine that evening. Billy detonates explosives to break some rock, attracting the attention of Jason, Kimberly, and nearby students, Trini and Zack. The five discover the Power Coins and each take one. While escaping mine security, their car is hit by a train. The five find themselves at home the next morning and discover they have been granted superhuman abilities. Elsewhere, Rita's body is found. Waking, she goes on a rampage, hunting pieces of gold to raise her minion Goldar to find the Zeo Crystal. The five teenagers return to the mine and discover an ancient spaceship where they meet Alpha 5 and Zordon's consciousness. They inform the teenagers about the Rangers history and Rita, warning that they have eleven days until Rita has her full power, finds the Zeo Crystal, and uses it to destroy life on Earth. The five leave the ship with no intention of returning until Zordon pleads with Jason to convince the team.The five returned to train the next day, but they cannot morph. They spend the next week training against simulated Putties and trying unsuccessfully to morph. To inspire the Rangers, Alpha reveals the Zords. Zack takes his Zord out for a joyride and almost kills the other Rangers when he crashes it. This angers Jason, and they fight. While trying to separate the two, Billy spontaneously morphs. However, when he becomes conscious of it, the armor disappears. Angered at their lack of progress, Zordon dismisses the group. Jason returns to the ship to confront Zordon and discovers that once the Rangers morph, it will open the Morphing Grid and allow Zordon to restore himself in a physical body. Feeling betrayed, Jason accuses Zordon of using the team for his own benefit. The team camp at the mine and bond with each other.Later that night, Rita attacks Trini and orders her to bring the Rangers to the docks. Trini informs them about Rita and they arrive to fight, but are quickly defeated. Rita forces Billy to reveal the location of the Zeo Crystal, kills him, and releases the others. The Rangers take Billy's body to the ship and ask Zordon to resurrect him. The Rangers agree they would give their lives for each other and resolve to defeat Rita. In doing so, they unlock the Morphing Grid. Zordon revives Billy, sacrificing being able to restore his physical self. With the team restored and confident, the Rangers morph into their armor.Rita creates Goldar, raises an army of Putties, and attacks Angel Grove to find the Zeo Crystal. The Rangers battle the Putties and head to Angel Grove in their Zords. After the Rangers destroy the Putties, Goldar pushes the Rangers and their Zords into a fiery pit. In the pit, the Zords combine, forming the Megazord. Rita merges with Goldar. The Rangers battle and destroy Goldar. After refusing Jason's offer to surrender, a defiant Rita tells the Rangers that more will come for the crystal. In the end, Megazord slapped Rita into space. The Rangers are praised as local heroes, and with Rita's threats foiled, they return to their normal lives.","

I don't know how i have became curious and decided to watch it but now they have convinced me and i think it's one of my best movies i have ever attended. So glad i watched it because the performance was great. i have only one point on the movie it's I think this movie isn't for kids to watch but it's mostly for +15. The story is very nice and the actors did great. I hope they're planning to make part two.","

"Sabre-El","25 September 2019","This is one of those cases which shows that movie ratings do not represent reality. To me, this movie offers so much given the type of movie it is meant to be. It's not meant to be serious, it's not meant to be dramatic. It's just meant to be a renewed version of the old TV series. And it delivers on that.The movie follows the protagonists' to becoming Power Rangers and almost two-thirds of the movie is dedicated to that. The pace during this time is quite good. Everything, from the graphics to the directing and acting (not so much, but it gets a pass as these aren't well-known actors) is top notch.The last third of the story is a bit rushed, but is still fulfilling. The villain's motivations are not so clear, and the same can be said about their powers. But this is Power Rangers; what do we even expect?All in all, a very decent modern take on the Power Rangers. One can see that the film-makers have tried their best to add as many throw-backs as they could. I'm not that big a fan of them, but I got to say that this actually ranks as one of the movies that I had fun watching this year. Will definitely recommend watching, esp. if you want to watch a family movie.","

"bkrauser-81-311064","24 March 2017","Guess its time to whip out your old Tamagotchi and listen to whatever Marcy Playground song you've recorded on your Tiger Talkboy when you were six; because the nineties are back! Don't believe me, just check out the newest blockbuster film that's about to hit your multiplex with the force of a speeding Bronco. Yes the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers are back and this time instead of importing stock footage from some cheap Japanese superhero show, this brooding, edgier version is importing clichés from every American superhero film from the last fifteen years.Just how much edgier is this new movie? Well the story begins with three of the five soon-to-be Rangers spending their Saturdays in detention so already they're more irascible than Bulk and Skull. They're also about half as much fun as evidenced after our five teenagers with attitude meet up, discover their multi-colored power coins and proceed to stare at each other in confusion. This lasts an entire act and throughout we're only given the archetypal outlines of our heroes to play with. There's the bland Red leader (Montgomery), the Yellow outsider (G.), the Black bad boy (Lin) and the Pink Ranger (Scott) who seems to think cutting her hair on a whim doesn't make her the personification of mayonnaise.Then of course there's Billy (Cyler), the Blue Ranger. He's on the spectrum; you can tell because he outright says he's ""on the spectrum."" While this could have been a good moment to truly act upon the TV show's (1993-1995) phoned-in anti-bully, inclusion-based ""the more you know,"" pablum, the movie basically just uses him as a narrative building block. That's of course when they're not also using the Blue Ranger as a tonally embarrassing point of mirth for the sake of undermining the gritty tone. Considering that his autism is boiled down to a running joke, its a miracle RJ Cyler comes across as sincere as he does. Every time the ensemble tries to elevate him as the movie's heartfelt center, you really want to believe it's sincerity, even if it feels counterfeit.Its that faux sincerity and the nostalgia that will no doubt sell long-time fans on this new film. As much as the reboot wobbles between seriousness and silliness, the fact that there is an appearance of a center of mass, means that there's just enough here for audiences to trick themselves into thinking they saw the best version they possibly could have made. It makes a kind of sense; how can you really make a realistic movie about children gaining superpowers through alien technology to fight evil? While I don't agree with the premise of the question (I mean, does it really need to be realistic?), I also don't think the answer is to wait until the very end to introduce the franchises sillier minutia. Especially when the directing and editing would make anyone with eyeballs want to spin them back into their head. It's not Fantastic Four (2014)-level bad, but the fact that I'm bringing up that film in the same breath as this one, is evidence their both are in the same ball park and both need to answer for the millions of dollars wasted. I mean come on, the best part about this mess is the slovenly fight choreography which could have been done with a couple of costumes and a million yen.It's hard to say Power Rangers (sponsored by Krispy Kreme) is the latest victim in franchise co-oping by greedy executives, short-sighted PR experts and story-arcs by committee. While Spider-Man fans and Batman fans could argue their IP's came from some nebulous notion of artistry over commerce, Power Rangers has been a cheaply cobbled cash grab pretty much from inception. In that regard the fact that this film has any semblance of sincerity is a minor miracle. If you got to see it, focus on that and that alone. Go, go mediocrity.","

"CountJonnie","23 September 2019","This is what happens when you take away the charm of a series that was funny in a cheesy way. The '93 series may have been deliberately bad, with horrible effects, acting, stories and was a glorified casting call for stunt performers. But it was funny, charming and witty. But when you take away the charm, all you're left with is a bad movie, that even managed to mess up the putty patrollers. What a shame!","

"AlexFalzon","23 March 2017","The new Power Rangers film features very little morphin' and is not exactly mighty.I should mention that the ""original"" (virtually all of the action sequences were actually stock footage from the Japanese Super Sentai) Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers was my favourite show between the ages of two and five. Believe it or not, though, I actually haven't watched this children's show in many years, so I can't really speak as to the film's loyalty to the source material.What I can say is that liberties have been taken with the characters' backstories, but the main personal attributes seem to be intact, and I had no problem with the changes. Trini (the yellow ranger) is gay, now, and Billy is ""on the spectrum"", but these changes merely gave depth to characters who really only existed as obvious stereotypes in the original series, and I liked that.I have to say that I did find it quite amusing that they make a big deal out of announcing every single character's full name in the final scene, but omit Trini's surname. Billy's mother calls out all of the other rangers' full names, and ends with ""and Trini!"" I can only assume that it's because in the show, her last name was Kwan, and the new actress, Becky G, is of Mexican descent. Just call her Kwan or give her a different name, good lord. Even funnier, in the end- credits every single actor playing a ranger's parent is credited with their character's name, except Trini's parents, who are credited as ""Trini's Dad"" and ""Trini's Mom"".The film stars the aforementioned Becky G, as well as her four team-mates played by Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, and Ludi Lin. I assumed all five were American (only two are), so flawless were their accents. They all deliver solid performances, with Montgomery and Cyler the only ones required by the screenplay to do any real acting. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks join the cast as the team's mentor and antagonist, respectively. Both are great, obviously, though seem to think themselves in an entirely different film than the main five. The tone of these two characters, both in dialogue and delivery, clashes crazily against the other five. It was probably intentional, but it was weird. There are certain extreme moments of melodrama sandwiched between scenes of cheesiness that just feel out-of-place, too.So in the movie the five teenagers with attitude (sadly, or perhaps thankfully, they are not referred to as such in the film) come across a mysterious rock and a strange cave, waking up the next morning with superpowers. They reunite and try to work out what's going on while familiarising themselves with their new abilities. If this sounds familiar, that's because it's basically the plot of Chronicle. Funnily enough, the writer of that film, Max Landis, was actually at one point attached to this movie, but is no longer credited. Weird.Five writers (count them), however, are credited. As often happens with films with a large number of writers, the script feels somewhat off. We begin with a coincidence that feels more lazy than anything; at the exact moment the five obtain their new powers, the antagonist's ""dead"" body is accidentally caught in a fishing net. For an even worse coincidence within a coincidence, the captain of that boat happens to be the father of one of the rangers. Of course.It's director Dean Israelite's second film, and I don't think his direction left much to be desired. His first film was Project Almanac, and I preferred Power Rangers over that one, The score is solid, the soundtrack pretty hit-and-miss. The editing is a little disappointing at times; we only see the rangers morph once, and it's not a very comprehensive look that we get. Also, Jason appears to pull a sword from nowhere and then we get a scene of him returning it to the space-ship later. Not sure what happened there. The action's decent, but we only get to it in the final twenty minutes of the film, and I mean that literally. There's no end-of-act-1 skirmish; the bad guys simply attack at the end of the movie.One other thing I find mildly irritating was the rangers' helmets retracting around their faces whenever they spoke. I guess the intentional might've been to make them feel more like relatable people and less like faceless drones, but it just came across as a lazy way to give the actors more face-time – which is silly, because, as I said, they only morph the one time. We've seen their faces plenty.The red ranger drives a red Ford Ranger, that was kind of cute. Certainly more subtle than when that same ranger hurls a Camaro at a bad guy and yells ""sorry, Bumblebee!"". Man, that moment was a funny little jab at the Transformers franchise; why'd you have to go and ruin it by playing Captain Obvious? The first song over the credits is the same as in the original film from 1995, so that was a nice reference, but I think I would've preferred the opening theme to the television show. That theme only plays once in the whole film, and is horribly misused. It only plays for a few seconds, and only the main chorus. Where's the build up!? You need to work up to it, you don't just blare it out for a second and then end it before we even realise it's playinghttp://alexfalzon.com/power-rangers/ - for more reviews.","

"afjmf","4 April 2017","This is not a Power Ranger movies. You can see the title and think ""Go, Go, Power Rangers!"" in your head, but there the similarities end. I will break down what this movie is by percentages: 5% Pacific Rim, 15% Power Rangers, 40% Chronicle, and 40% The Breakfast Club. All the race changes do not make a cool movie. It makes the First five look bad, Alpha-5 look stupid, and Zordon look self-serving. Goldar is totally wrong and Rita was designed after a Power Rangers in Space villain. Zordon does want to stop Rita, who had Been a Ranger (?), 65 million years ago with Zordon (?)and was trapped in a cave or something, while Zordon was trapped in the Morphin Grid. I say Zordon is self-serving because the only reason, initially, is so the Morphin Grid will open and he can reenter the world a living being. The part that gets me is when Billy (now a black nerd with weak hip-hop moves ""dies"", Zordon has the chance to become ""alive"" again, and brings him back to life. This irks me as Zordon as the Blue Ranger would be most interesting, and would Billy have been stuck in the wall? Poor Zack is the most pathetic though. Now an poor Asian with a sick mother, he is so bland as Billy got the dance moves. This movie is Voltron meets Chronicle, and it is mostly boring trash.","

"RforFilm","24 March 2017","Anyone (not just kids) will tell you that part of the 1990s couldn't be understood without looking at one of the biggest phenomenons that debuted at the time, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. I'm aware that the show is still on TV, though it's been a long time since I watched it. As a kid of the 90s, I can say that I liked watching it and even held a Power Rangers birthday party when I was in the second grade. Unlike Disney or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers were something of a fad that I kept in my heart for about three years before I moved on.For those that don't know, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came from Japanese show called Super Sentai. While all the scenes featuring the rangers fighting monsters, puttys and Rita Repulsa came from Japan ala stock footage, the American footage was new and featured new teenagers becoming the rangers to stop evil. I gave the show another watch recently and discovered that it was way cheesier then I remembered. However, there is a fascination with just how cheesy it was and I had fun exploring it. Like a lot of recent super hero movies, our teenage heroes get their turn for a gritty reboot in Power Rangers. In the Northern California town of Angel Grove, young Jason Scott (played by Dacre Montgomery) ruins his football career after a prank gets him arrested. While in detention, he ends up befriending autistic Billy Cranston (played by RJ Miller) and popular girl Kimberly Hart (played by Naomi Scott). The three end up at a rock quarry where Billy is working on uncovering a mysterious object while the too-cool-for-school punk Zack (played by Ludi Lin) and quiet loner Trini (played by Becky G) happen to be at the same time. The objects are rock-like coins that change their lives forever. All five teenagers wake up the next morning to see that their stronger and more resistant to pain. They agree to go back to the site to look for answers. There they find a space ship that has been hidden for millions of years. Awaiting them is Zodon (played by Brian Cranston), a former ranger who seems to be a part of the ships power grid, and Alpha 5 (played by Bill Hader). The kids are told that the coins chose them to become the new rangers. They have to adapt to their new powers soon to stop the recently awoken witch Ritia Repulsa (played by Elizabeth Banks).I have to give Power Rangers a lot of credit for attempting to take a lot of the ridiculous concepts for the show and trying to make them more grounded. The results are mixed, even though overall I had fun. The best thing about this movie was something that the show lacked; the chemistry and emotion from the five teenagers. Not only are all five good actors, but the movie takes a lot of time getting to know them and just how they came to form their team.Even Brian Cranston and Bill Hader do well in adapting their characters to the big screen. One of the weaker performances is Elizabeth Banks. While everyone seems to be playing their parts seriously, she made her character very campy. While she can be fun to watch, it can come off as inconsistent.Speaking of which, the overall tone seems to mix fine until the end. You'll be surprised to learn that out heroes don't morph until way later. Once they do, the movie seems to have trouble sticking to it's gritty origin, especially when the zords start to fight the larger monsters. It's not as impressive as Pacific Rim, but it's better shot then the remake of Godzilla. I'd say the movie is stronger when the characters don't morph.I'll give this seven red ranger helmets out of ten. I'm surprised how much care went into the scriptbefore the characters become the Power Rangers. It seems that the movies really wants to emulate The Breakfast Club more then it does the TV show is based off of. If you didn't like the show, your probably not going to like the movie. It'll probably satisfy former fans like myself and those that want some sci-fi action. I'd say of your even a little curious, then go go see this movie.","

Bryan Cranston did a great job as always. Morphing was fresh looking - animation wise and that's all good I could find. For a 100 million budget movie, it should have looked way better. Actors are still green at best. I must say that old school Power rangers are still better than these ones.","

"lalegre-05136","24 March 2017","This reboot is by far one of the worst I have seen. I grew up in the 90s and my love for power Rangers was dear. If you are an original fan please DO NOT watch. The film was sexualized and at times a little disturbing. This remake is for a whole new generation. If this is what we are producing for the next generation then this is unsettling. The audience In the movie seemed to enjoy this movie but as an original fan I had to walk out half way. The actors performed more on a chessy, no acting skills level. The villain was a tormented individual with no talent. Zordon was completely different, more of an aggressive angry frustrated personality. That alone made me walk out, original Zordon was patient, wise, and kind. I believe we got 15 minutes of fighting if that in this 2 hour movie. Everything that was once positive about the series, was completely missing in the movie. Sad to say, the new Power Rangers movie was a disaster.","

"ironhorse_iv","6 April 2017","Like the highly popular 1990s show distributed by Saban Entertainment (later Saban Brands), the movie directed by Dean Israelite & written by John Gatins with story by Burk Sharpless, Matt Sazama, Kieran and Michele Mulroney, tells the story of five teenagers with attitude: Jason Lee Scott AKA Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly Hart AKA Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott), Billy Cranston AKA Blue Ranger (RJ Cyler), Zack Taylor AKA Black Ranger (Ludi Lin) & Trini Kwan AKA Yellow Ranger (Becky G) being recruited by the all-powerful inter-dimensional being named Zordon (Bryan Cranston) to save the Planet Earth from the wicked threats of the evil witch/former Green Ranger, Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) and her horde of monsters. Without spoiling the movie, too much, when, first seeing the trailer, I was somewhat skeptical on how, this movie was being presented. After all, I was very tired of seeing fake-looking CGI, horrible dialogue and heavy broody teenager storyline clichés story writing, whenever Hollywood attempts to reboot a beloved, pre-existing kid's show property onto the big screen. It had all the red flags. However, after watching this movie; I can say, the film was not that bad, but not great, either. A decent film with a really cool 1980s vibe electric synthesizer mixed current popular tunes soundtrack by Brian Tyler. Plus, I like how they fit the retro 'Go Go Power Rangers' theme song. And that's coming from not a huge fan of anything Tokusatsu! Yes, over the years, 'The Power Rangers' TV series has had many incarnations, and with that, came along many big screen movies ranging from 1995's 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie' to 1997's 'Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'. However, it's safe to say, this 2017's reboot of the hugely popular '90s Fox Kids TV show is probably the best of the film series. It could even be, better than the original show. I know a many of you, are thinking, how could, I say that, since I call this movie 'only decent', but let me explain. The movie will never, outdo the popularity of the original show, the kid show was a 1990s pop culture phenomenon. An enigma that help usher, more Japanese kid's shows to US audiences. Although, this movie did outdo the original, in fleshing out the character, through character development and arches. The original show is full of somewhat racist stereotypes & awful pun-driven jokes, & unrealistic goodie two shoes teenagers who look nothing like their age. At least, in this movie, the characters were all unique and ground-breaking. After all, who ever heard of an artistic & lesbian ranger, before? While, some of their actions is indeed, not family friendly & somewhat clichés; at least, they seem like teenager dealing with angst, unlike the original. I love the redemption storyline, they were forced to go through. It made, some scenes like the camp fire and dock scene kinda heart-breaking. All the actors playing the rangers were great in the roles, even if they can be a bit annoying at times. Also, the acting in this film is a lot better than the original. While, the original cast is all iconic. They're by far, worst actors, then this new crew. However, I do miss, Bulk & Skull. Don't like the generic bullies in this movie. Still, the villains in this new movie was somewhat better. Don't get me wrong, Machiko Soga as Rita was fun to watch, but Elizabeth Banks as Rita was downright scary. She really did seem like a threat to be taken seriously. She was amazing. However, I can't say the same with Bill Hader & Bryan Cranston's performance. Hader's voice work for Alpha 5 seem kinda of jarring and out of place. At least, he wasn't as annoying as the original; while, Cranston seem limited to a few facial expression due to what the animator could animate in a few short months. It explains, why you rarely see his face, but hear his voice in the dark background. That's another problem with this film, it has way too many night sequences. Even with some light & amps up violence, the fake-looking fast-motion CGI action & wired work stunt long jumping looks terrible & sloppy. While, the 1990s 'The Power Rangers' is just as infamous with its very simplistic visual effects, with people in fake-looking rubber suits, cheap fireworks and recycle Japanese 'Super Sentai 'franchise stock footage. At least, it was bright and easy to see. Other problems, this movie has is the choppy editing and lack of exposition. Some scenes just don't go anywhere, or seem abandoned. A good example is how and why everybody got near the cave site in the middle of nowhere at the time. Also, it never really explained how they got from the second car crash of the movie to back to their own beds, since the Command Center does not seem to have teleportation capabilities. Also, the movie doesn't explain, why a ranger can only morph, when only they all can work as a team, but how Rita can still powerful even after betraying her team and built Goldar!? Nor does it explain how crashing multiply cars, and blowing up your locker, led to detention, and not seriously jail time as terrorism. However, the biggest complain, I got about this movie is the blatant produce placement of Kristy Kreme. It feature so much, it borderline into absurdity. There's a certain level of cheesiness, I'm willing to take, and a goal plot of getting to Kristy Kreme is not one of them. Overall: At the end of the day, the movie is just fun. It's a popcorn flick & that's all that matters. Maybe, not good enough to watch in theaters, but good enough to rent. Still, it made me, excited for a sequel!!! I enjoyed the hell out of it.","

RJ Cyler (Billy, the Blue Ranger) gives a great performance that steals the show for me. However its a movie that most of critics wont enjoy, because its not made for their demographic, unlike many others in the same category. Its a movie made for fans of the show and also to a younger audience, with details that maybe wont reach the older audience or non-fans. Overall, it is really worth checking it out for what it is!","

"m_kelava","17 April 2017","The whole experience started kind of good. The first 20 minutes were mostly alright, but in my mind what the movie failed to capture as a whole was that the fact it is not the 90s anymore and even tho CGI was decent I failed to find that nostalgia feel that I was in search of when I heard the new Power Rangers movies was coming out. You do not feel anything for the characters and by the end I had felt that it was only starting to get good. It mostly feels like an elderly man tried to make something teenagers would find interesting, but the problem is, that elderly man is stuck in the last century and most of us had moved on. They forgot that kids of today couldn't care less about Power Rangers and that only people like me who used to watch the shows as a kid would be interested tho laziness added to it not being interesting and in my opinion pretty dumb. Characters are stereotypical high school kids you cannot relate too because I guess the writers couldn't bother or were afraid of any backlash had they done anything mildly interesting with them, as we see in all sorts of media today. There are certain points where you can feel what it could have been but those moments drop off pretty quickly and you find yourself either mocking scenes or plainly not caring for the characters or anything really as I did. Overall I cannot give it one star because I had paid to see it, which in my opinion is already too much for something like this, but I think had the characters been interesting as individuals and if the story hadn't felt rushed by the end it might have even been a good movie worthy of my time and nostalgia.","

"stevendbeard","24 March 2017","I saw ""Power Rangers"", starring Dacre Montgomery-Stranger Things_tv, Safe Neighborhood; Naomi Scott-Inspector Lewis_tv, The 33; Elizabeth Banks-The Hunger Games movies, Slither; Bryan Cranston-The Infiltrator, Rock of Ages and the voice of Bill Hader-Popstar:Never Stop Never Stopping, Men in Black 3.This is the 3rd Power Rangers theatrical movie-the first was 1995's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers & the second was 1997's Turbo:A Power Rangers Movie-but this is actually a reboot and not really connected to the previous movies or TV shows. It has better effects-Duh!-and a couple of cameos of previous Rangers-Jason David Frank & Amy Jo Johnson-so keep an eye out during a crowd scene in Angel Grove. They are easy to spot, the camera stays on them for a bit. This movie starts with an alien team of Power Rangers, led by Bryan/Zordon, that are fighting Elizabeth/Rita Repulsa during the dinosaur age of the Earth. After the results of that battle, flash to the present, where teenagers Dacre, Naomi and three others find 5 power coins which lead them to a buried space ship. Bill voices a robot called Alpha 5, who is on board and introduces them to Bryan, who is now part of the ship and communicates as a disembodied head. The teens are informed that they have been chosen to become the new Power Rangers, super heroes that protect the Earth, and the training begins. Otherwise, the usual aspects of the Power Ranger universe are here; lots of martial arts fighting, rock-like creatures as henchmen, giant titans in battle, Zords and they do use the Power Rangers theme song-Go Go Power Rangers! As the end credits start, there is a quick scene having something to do with Tommy Oliver but there is nothing at the very end of the movie. FYI: In case you are one of those ignorant people that wanted to boycott Beauty & the Beast-for some kind of gay issues-then you might want to steer clear from this movie, too. Otherwise, you might just meet the first homosexual Power Ranger. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi violence, action and destruction, language and some crude humor and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. The Power Rangers are not for everyone-I know some people that do not care for them-but I really liked this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

"MattyRich92","20 May 2019","Instead of making a two hour drama, it should have been an hour and a half action movie. The creative team invents their own Power Ranger lore, and it's like Twilight sexed Transformers. The tone shifts abruptly in the third act. It goes from serious Y.

"Pumpkin_Man","27 March 2017","Just warning you, this review will contain spoilers, mostly about the things I didn't like and how it compares to the show. You have been warned! As a child of the 90's, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows. That was my jam. I had a lot of the toys, and my mom took me to see the original Power Rangers movie with Ivan Ooze when it was released at the theater way back in 1995. 20 years later, along comes a newer rebooted darker PG-13 Power Rangers movie. I was kinda excited, but wasn't liking the look of Rita Repulsa or Goldar from the trailers. Now, after seeing the movie, I still have very mixed feelings about it. I didn't like that they didn't start out as friends. In the show, they were already best friends. Here, they are social outcasts who try to get along with each other. There was no Bulk and Skull, no Ernie, no Youth Center/Juice Bar, I still don't like the look of Goldar. They only played the ""Go go Power Rangers"" theme song for a couple of seconds when they got into their Zords. I could probably go on a little longer, but I'll mention just two more things; they couldn't even morph til the last 20 minutes of the movie, and Zordon was very critical of them. In the series, he already had confidence in them. I understand this is a reboot and it's starting over, but as a nostalgic kid of the 90's, I couldn't help but compare it to the show.Jason is a football all-star, but throws it away when he pulls a prank and gets involved in a police chase. He's put in detention where he meets Billy and Kimberly. Billy takes Jason out to a quarry where they find 5 colorful crystals. (Kimberly, Zack and Trini just so happened to be out there too) The crystals give them superhuman strength and powers (This contradicts the series because they only had their powers when they morphed into their armor, but oh well) They go back to the quarry, and stumble upon a giant spaceship where Zordon and Alpha 5 have lived for the last 65 million years. Meanwhile, a fishing boat stumbles upon Rita Repulsa's body in the sea. They bring her onboard and she begins to resurrect herself. Rita needs lots of gold to bring Goldar to life to help her find the Zeo crystal. Throughout the film, the gang trains and tries to morph. When they finally do morph, it's pretty cool, but the fighting and action scenes were quite underwhelming. I even remember thinking to myself ""That's it?"" Elizabeth Banks did a fairly good job as Rita. She even says ""Make my monster grow!"" I didn't hate the movie, I just think it could've been done better. I'll definitely buy it when it comes out to Blu-Ray. I'll say that this film will really make you appreciate the TV series and the '95 film with Ivan Ooze better. If you're an old school Power Rangers fan, you might like SABAN'S POWER RANGERS!!!","

"Quebec_Dragon","22 March 2017","I'm a guy in his early forties who usually loves (good) superhero movies. I've only caught a few episodes of Power Rangers here and there over the years, found it campy, predictable fun, but wasn't really a fan. I write this so you know where this opinion comes from. So after a promising start in the distant past and some high-school hi-jinks with a bunch of misfits/rejects, something strange started happening. As more and more fantastical elements were introduced, the more I felt underwhelmed and doubtful. Not quite sure when it started, but it was particularly obvious with the introduction of the Zorgs (robot-dinosaur vehicles) that was very lacklustre. The Zorg designs might have been too ""detailed"", but I even had trouble making out what dinosaur they were supposed to be. To be fair, I love the new Ranger outfits although, once again, their first appearance was kind of muffed.The plot that seemed not so bad at first with actual character building got stupid and corny pretty fast with dumb decisions from both the heroes (yes, let's all jump) and the lame main villain (let's end all life on Earth with me on it, because, uh...). The actors certainly tried hard, were probably better than standard TV actors, but they didn't sell the touching or dramatic scenes to me. Then again, I also blame the script. However, the highlight acting-wise was the young black man called RJ Cyler in an autistic role (despite too much makeup). But beyond the plot and acting, kind of secondary in that type of film, there should have been a building sense of wonder and excitement that wasn't really there for me. The visual effects were hit (Zordon on the wall) and miss (the Zorgs). The fights that should have been thrilling seemed mostly unexciting and uninspired to me, especially the last one. So without the nostalgia factor in its favour, this big-budget remake didn't make a Power Rangers fan out of me.Rating: 3.5 out of 10 (mediocre)P.S. A really obnoxious product placement actually got some of the few good laughs.","

"Martinito_08183","24 July 2019","Lionsgate's latest attempt of making another franchise and yet they failed to understand how to make a good first film. They always forget that the audience has to be invested and to care on everything that is happening, so that it can be successful and everyone be excited for future installments, but every studio doesn't care at all. The only thing that they care is making money and art doesn't bring them that and that's why we get bland, boring, messy and broken products that are disguised as films.Saban's Power Rangers is just a bad film with many aspects that just don't work or having things that we've seen a thousand time before. I watched Power Rangers many times as a kid (DinoThunder, Mystic Force and Operation Overdrive) and while the TV franchise that the 2017 reboot is based on is very corny and cheesy, the film still had potential and opportunities to evolve into something special and different, but i didn't expect to become a very uninteresting and generic superhero film.","

One of the best films I've seen in decades! On few occasions didn't know what's the next thing that is going to happen, and what later happened was spot on! When I went out, I was expecting some real s**t to happen in the city, didn't felt that for a while. Really left me with fantastic impression. I'm 28 and I want to be a Power Ranger again!

"asillett-57045","29 March 2017","This movie is boring, poorly written, and stupid. It's not stupid in a fun way, either. I went into this movie with expectations that I would have for a Transformers movie; I hoped for explosions, fun action scenes, and cool CGI. Guess what this movie had? NONE OF THAT. Because it was so boring, I was forced to sit through boring scenes of people talking about boring back stories.This movie suffered from the same problems that Superman v Batman and Suicide Squad suffered from: they tried so hard to fit so much stuff in, that the pacing is terrible and nothing feels like it goes together. The whole movie is very forgettable except one scene... (Spoilers, kinda)The opening scene, when the Red Ranger (who's character name I can't remember and can't be bothered to go back and look) gets into a car chase with the police after pulling a prank at the high school. The cinematography and camera-work is fantastic and really got my hopes very high for the rest of the movie. It's reminiscent of the tank scene from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. It's a little difficult to pay attention to everything that's going on, but at least it looks cool and keeps you engaged, UNLIKE THE REST OF THE MOVIE. Overall, I would say that no matter what reviews people read, they're going to see it no matter what. Also, (spoilers again) when they finally morph into the animal robots (I never watched the show much, so maybe I just don't get it) they play the original theme song from the show for no reason other than to force nostalgia. At least the original show, from what I did see, was campy and fun. This movie can't decide if it wants to be serious or funny (just like Suicide Squad). Come to think of it, this movie has a lot of similarities to Suicide Squad, except with Suicide Squad, it had more than THREE ACTION SCENES IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. This is a bad movie. Go see it.","

"pianotm-58404","26 March 2017","Many of the bad reviews that came out for this movie make some good points, but a few are obviously pretentious, and are badmouthing the movie based on film snobbery and have little to do with the substance film. The film itself does not match the verdict of these pretentious reviews, all of which fail miserably to address any points of the film. It's as if these people expect even the lowest children's to have the same artistry as a Ridley Scott or an Orson Welles piece, and it begs the question, if these people demand such a high quality from their films, then why are they watching kid targeted superhero movies? Power Rangers starts out weak, with relatively poor cinematography in a chase sequence and an overall uncomfortable introduction to three of our heroes. It takes them awhile to start to have chemistry, but 15 to 20 minutes after the opening logos, they're starting to play well together, and the film starts to be enjoyable. Once they discover the coins and begin to develop their powers, it quickly becomes obvious that this movie was made by fans of the show, and while this is certainly a cash grab, it's anything but soulless. It's genuinely funny for all of the right reasons (and some of the wrong reasons). It has a few moral messages that don't quite hit the mark, but it's obvious what they're trying to say. Elizabeth Banks has the camp turned up to overdrive. This movie isn't Shakespeare and she knows it. She is totally not taking this seriously, and honest to goodness, I love her to death for it. She completely owns Rita Repulsa. She does over-the-top beautifully.The movie adds a bit of unnecessary angst. The Rangers aren't friends to start since they don't know each other, but for the most part, they play well together and most of their interaction is totally Breakfast Club, and they do it so well. Zordon has got the Rangers together for totally selfish reasons, and throughout the movie, he isn't the most likable character.Alpha 5 is perfect in every aspect. He's totally the Alpha 5 you remember but he's nicely refined and his place in the movie makes him irreplaceable.The film takes more time with the Zords. In the show, the Zords would immediately form Megazord upon being summoned. Here, it spends time showing us the individual Zords in action before showing us Megazord.It's true: this movie doesn't superhero quite like it's flashier competitors. It's action set pieces, except for the last one, aren't as big. Surprisingly, it's actually a little less flash and takes more time with the characters on an interpersonal level. Somehow, at the same time, it absolutely succeeds in delivering everything you expect from a Power Rangers movie. From morphing, to battles with enemies made from clay (fans will know the Putty Patrolers only too well), to robot battles, and finally to the giant Kaiju battle at the end. Even the theme is well represented. The movie has a multitude of obvious weaknesses, but it hits all of the right notes and it's exactly what you want from Power Rangers.","

"drewmvshs-81721","13 June 2017","Especially in today's times:-With every resource being available to big studios and movie directors.-Where there are tons of excellent movies already made that can bestow inspiration and/or take example from.-The internet.. c'mon, it has anything a person could need (put in the effort, do research and this is how a regular person with a go pro and a laptop can produce some killer ""home"" productions).-In the case of a movie like this, that has decades of source material to pull from and analyze what made the TV show a hit to begin with.... I mean, it's like being handed a winning recipe, the ingredients, step-by- step directions, and a multi-person team to cook it.... and still fail miserably at it.Bottom line... There is really no excuse for a studio and/or director to produce trash like this. It's almost having to go out of your way to make it so awful.I don't want to give any spoilers, so I can instead say this honestly- It's just all bad. Dull actors to which we feel no connection, more annoyed by them if anything. Horrific CGI, yet almost all of the 2 whole fight scenes that amount to about 15 minutes of the film are that crap CGI. Yes, you read correctly, this movie is almost over before they even become power rangers and have their ""final (only) battle""... the ending of which is SO stupid, it makes you wonder if this movie is really a satire or parody than an actual, serious movie. It's more like a horribly cheesy teen drama that is trying WAY to hard to be cool. It reminds me nothing of the series at all other than retaining the names and using terms like power rangers and zords... Alpha, Zordon, Rita, the putties, and the Zords are almost unidentifiable... It's hilariously pathetic, really. Rita and Zordons ridiculous new origin stories are an example of the studio trying too hard, but just digging the hole deeper. The 5 minutes of screen time for the Mega Zord is a total let down because it doesn't even show it come together like the TV show and it doesn't look like a mega zord, but way more like one of the Transformers. There is no climax, tension, or suspense... most of it is hearing lame one liners from the cast, or watching them try to be extra cool. That mixed in with every one of them wanting to show us they are ""badasses"" by being rebellious teens who are too much for normal school, so they have to stay in detention all year, also by breaking the law repeatedly, underage drinking, using every cuss word they can think of, trying hard to play that sex appeal angle, and actually describing a bestiality scene that just happened off camera... WHAT?! However, the power ""discs"" (that are definitely not morphers) chose them because they are ""pure of heart"" lolololol... and that's the 1 thing the studio got right (at least in their minds they think it's getting it right) which is using all kinds of tired movie clichés and absurd, out of nowhere plot devices that both progress the story AND miraculously saves them a couple of different times from what appears to be certain death. Of course, these devices and plot holes are barely even mentioned, most times there was no bother to explain these select impossible moments to the audience..... It's like there were deleted scenes in a couple of parts almost, missing info.This MOVIE is a JOKE!It's an insult since it's an obvious cash grab, sponsored by Krispy Kreme. I cant remember how many times the words ""Krispy Kreme"" were said in this movie, and the krispy kreme building had more screen time than the action sequences. It was also central to the plot of the entire movie. Its clear the studio didn't even try to make it half way decent, they just wanted an ""Insta-Blockbuster/Franchise""","

"Badmoviessuck","14 February 2019","This movie is a complete mess.DIALOGUE
The dialogue has a bunch of cringy one liners and it's not good at all.
They have a tendency to explain everything to us instead of showing us which is stupid.CHARACTERS
It feels like they tried to give the characters depth but during the production they just ignored it.
Jason has daddy issues and that gets ignored through the rest of the movie, Zack has a dying mother and that gets ignored as well, Trini has strict parents and that gets ignored, and the pink ranger has some school drama and that gets ignored (probably for the better).
None of them have true desires and motives and they dont change and grow and how they got together was stupid.
Jason protected black boy and pink ranger conveniently swam in that place were black boy explode stuff and Zack is just conveniently sitting somewhere and star power shows up from nowhere.
There was this scene were trini ran away from the others for no reason and i was confused.VILLAIN
The villain wants gold and she is stupid
first she has no real motive than to get kristalls cause of power which is really bland.
And also she is stupid.
She attacks Star power for no reason and explains were she is headed and then leaves her and dosen't even kill her which is very stupid.
And once they found the villain cause she explained were she was to Star power then they all go there get captured and then the villain explains her freaking plan which is really cliche and stupid.ACTION
The action is bland and there is nothing special to it and the final act was worse than black panthers final act.
How could they now that the megazord had wings that could be used as daggers when they have never even seen how the megazord looks? I'ts stupid.VERDICT
This movie is a cliche mess that should have never existed.
There is already tons of power rangers series and movies why make another? Oh right i know, money.","

"byson5186","27 March 2017","A lot of T.V. shows Millennials grew up with as kids, are getting made into PG-13 movies with 21st Century CGI, and Power Rangers is no exception. This movie was entertaining, but it also felt pretty cliché. The action felt like nothing we haven't seen from other movies like Transformers or Avengers with the CGI we have nowadays.To start off with the Rangers cast, I'm sure all of us can agree they weren't as good as the original 6 Power Rangers including Tommy, when the show first started. I'm amazed years later that they could have such a good cast of the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Even if they weren't the best at acting they were perfect for their parts of the characters they played. Naomi Scott doesn't even come close to how awesome Amy Jo Johnson was as Kimberly. Amy Jo Johnson is immediately still recognizable as Kimberly over 20-years later.Another thing about the characters, is even in the trailer, I've seen people compare this movie to The Breakfast Club with characters in High School getting in trouble and having Saturday detention. In the original series, the characters were good friends hanging out throughout the series. They were good kids and present themselves as role models for a kids show. In this movie, they were more like rebellious kids, especially Jason. The movie could have at least included Bulk and Skull in detention as Bulk and Skull were a main part of the original series, and always in detention.I also ought to mention that in Mighty Morphin, the characters were martial artists and gymnasts. It was cool to see martial arts in the show, and martial arts fights. Most of the episodes had unmorphed fights with the putties where we didn't see their super strength, but natural abilities. I ought to say the putty fight in episode 3, ""Teamwork"" where Trini and Kimberly were fighting putties at the dumpsite was amazing and the hitting was on sync with the music on that scene. You hear the beating sounds at the proper time when there is hitting. That small scene from the one of the first ever episodes of Power Rangers, has in my opinion more entertaining action than the action in this movie.The zords in this movie felt like what we'd see in a Transformers movie. In Mighty Morphin the dinozords were easily distinguishable. We saw them get called in most of the episodes and saw them come out from their hiding places, the Mastodon coming out of the Arctic, shooting cold blasts. The Pterodactyl coming out of a volcano. Sabertooth Tiger running really fast and jumping over a bush. In the movie the zords just felt like something they could each command with no individuality, and I thought seemed less realistic as CGI than how they filmed them in the original series.Rita on the other hand seemed better on this movie than the T.V. show. In the show she mostly resides on Moon Palace trying to come up with a diabolical plan to take over. In this movie, she was truly presented as an evil character. I feel like this Rita could kill the Power Rangers way more easily than Rita from the original series. So yeah, I'd say Rita was the one thing the movie did better than the show.The putties weren't as good. Not like stuntmen from the show where we again see actual martial arts without the super powers in action. I prefer the original effects as I think they seem more realistic especially movement. These CGI effects are cool, but mostly feel like something you'd see on a computer with fast movement that doesn't look as realistic as when the zords and Power Rangers morphed, are men in costumes. I've mostly complained and compared this to the series. It was still entertaining. I liked the scene where the characters get to know each others, which felt reminiscent to a scene in Breakfast Club. I also like the scene where they jump in the water and we see what's below it!! That scene was cool!! But, overall while an entertaining movie, it feels a little cliché to what we're used to seeing in cinema nowadays. I think the biggest flaw in the movie was not having martial arts like the show. But, it is still an entertaining movie I'm sure you'll find interesting. I'll give it a 6/10.","

"dave-mcclain","24 March 2017","The Power Rangers are otherwise ordinary teenagers who are recruited, trained and equipped by the wizard-like Zordon to defend the earth against various extraterrestrial threats. The Power Rangers each dress in a distinctive color and have some individualized powers and weapons and some in common. These young superheroes operate under a strict set of guidelines which includes anonymity. The Power Rangers franchise started when media mogul Haim Saban adapted the Japanese franchise ""Super Sentai"" for American audiences (but using footage from the Japanese original). Since starting out as the Fox Kids TV series ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" in 1993, Power Rangers series have been produced by various entertainment companies and aired on various networks in the U.S. and around the world (including, ironically, back in Japan, where the concept was born). The characters have also appeared in toy form, in comics and video games and, in 1995 and 1997, in low budget feature films. The action adventure sci-fi movie ""Power Rangers"" (PG-13, 2:04) (also called ""Saban's Power Rangers"") represents a reboot and an expansion of the cinematic part of the franchise.Let's meet the new Power Rangers! Jason Scott (Dacre Montgomery), the teenager who becomes the Red Ranger (the group's leader), is a high school football star who has pulled one too many stupid pranks and lost his chance to play football in college. He's now wearing an ankle monitor and attending detention every Saturday to make up for his most recent misdeeds. Soon-to-be Pink Ranger Kimberly Hart (Naomi Scott) is a cheerleader who has committed a cruel faux pas which has led to her falling out of favor with her clique and also landed her in detention. Blue Ranger Billy Cranston (RJ Cyler) is an autistic kid who gets picked on at school and is also serving some time in detention. Black Ranger Zack (Ludi Lin) is a loner who spends much of his time caring for his terminally ill mother. Last, but not least, is Yellow Ranger Trini (musician and model Becky G), also a loner, who happens to represent the Q in LGBTQ and is an outsider among this group of outsiders, who initially refer to her as ""crazy girl"".Jason, Kimberly and Billy meet ""Breakfast Club"" style in Saturday detention and they all end up together at a local quarry, where they attract the attention of Zack and Trini (who happen to be hanging out there, individually) when Billy blows off the side of a hill searching for something that his (deceased) miner father had told him about. What Billy's explosion reveals is a sheer, glass-like sheet of rock which contains five differently colored medallions (red, pink, blue, yellow and black) or ""coins"". Each of the teens takes a coin and each wakes up the next morning to the realization that some things are different about them, not the least of which is suddenly being in possession of extreme strength. After they get together at school and compare notes, they decide to get together that night at the quarry to figure out what is happening to them and why. That's where things morph into something mighty weird.When they reassemble at the quarry, and after they discover that they can also climb really fast and jump really far, they find that at the bottom of a deep chasm is a lake which leads to an underground cavern where they find an ancient alien space ship. They are greeted by a robot named Alpha 5 (voiced by Bill Hader and looking like a cross between other-than-human 1980s movie characters Johnny 5 from ""Short Circuit"" and ""E.T."" from well, you know). Alpha 5 wakes up a former Red Ranger named Zordon (voiced and acted via motion capture by Bryan Cranston, who did a couple voices in the original TV series). Zordon lost his team and his own life 65 million years earlier fighting against a rogue Green Ranger called Rita Repulsa. (Zordon's consciousness was preserved in a computer.) Zordon explains that Rita (Elizabeth Banks) is power hungry and ""pure evil"" so he banished her to the bottom of the sea, but she is coming back and is intent on stealing the Zeo Crystal, which is what makes life on earth possible. Despite his fully articulated doubts, Zordon says that, if these five teenagers have the coins, it's not an accident and they are meant to be the next group of Power Rangers. The new Rangers also have their doubts, but they think that this is all pretty cool and they go along with Zordon's physically demanding training program as they also work to come together as a team so they can morph into fully capable Power Rangers, able to defeat Rita and her huge golden monster, Goldar, thus saving their small town.""Power Rangers"" is a worthy successor and enjoyable update to the 1990s pop culture juggernaut. Writer John Gatins (""Need for Speed"") and director Dean Israelite (""Project Almanac"") give us authentic characters, appealing visuals, good action and they strike just the right balance between honoring their source material and updating it for a new generation. Playing the Power Rangers are relative unknowns, but they are well-cast and pleasingly diverse – both as actors and in character. However, that's one of the reasons (along with an unnecessarily crude scene very early in the movie and a smattering of adult language) that makes this the first Power Rangers movie to be rated ""PG-13"" and questionable for small children. This is also the first Power Rangers movie to be (slightly) over two hours long but it feels rushed. It's an effective launch for a 21st century film franchise, but there's a lot going on (which is both good news and bad news). Plus, there are a few too many big coincidences in assembling the new Power Rangers and fueling their adventure, but this is still a mostly well-executed and entertaining movie. ""B+""","

"CANpatbuck3664","25 March 2017","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a brief vision of some Rangers past in the Cenozoic Era (describing that scene would give too much away) we meet some of our current Power Rangers. Jason Scott (Dacre Montgomery) is pulling a prank by leading a cow into a locker room but he's interrupted by the police showing up to the school. He tries to drive away but he ends up causing an accident. He wrecks his knee in the process (prematurely ending his football career) and earns house-arrest and detention in the process. Also in that classroom serving detention are Kimberly (Naomi Scott) and Billy (RJ Cyler). Billy is autistic and is getting bullied by some other kids when Jason steps into protect him. To thank him, Billy offers to throw off the signal of his anklet and let him borrow his van. They venture out at night to a mine that Billy used to frequent with his dad (who is unfortunately deceased). After bumping into Kimberly unexpectedly, Jason is about to leave when Billy sets off an explosion in the mine. Two other teenagers Zack (Ludi Lin) and Trini (Becky G.) hear the explosion and come running. Under the rock is a thick glass-like substance with 5 different coloured stones buried beneath it. They hack them out and then flee the scene to avoid being caught by security.I watched the Power Rangers show when I was a kid but I was so young that I don't have finite memories or details from it. For a show that was known for how cheesy it could be, I was impressed with how they modernized the show for audiences today. Sure, this version was heavy on the CGI but the designs were a good mix of the familiar and the new. They put a lot of detail into story elements like the Ranger's backgrounds and while the tone of the movie fluctuates a lot (more on that later) I think they tried really hard to be innovative and bring fresh ideas to this potential franchise. I really liked how characters like Zordon, Alpha-5 and Rita Repulsa looked and the designs of the suits and even the Megazord were impressive.I mentioned character development and although the Rangers were all mildly annoying at different points in the story, (that's not the movie's fault, they're moody teenagers) Power Rangers gives each of the central cast strong motivations and a reason to yearn to inclusiveness. Their interactions with each other are relatively strong and their treatment of subjects that can be considered taboo were actually admirable (Billy being ""on the scale"" and Trini being LGBT). They don't skate over this stuff but they don't make a big deal of it either. They hit you over the head with how much these kids our outsiders but other than lacking some subtlety, Power Rangers treats these teenagers with respect and gives their actors/actresses the material to succeed.The Power Rangers themselves were all played by actors/actresses I hadn't heard of. I think they all do good work, I'd give the nod to RJ Cyler for being the standout. He would have been the comedic relief in any other movie but he's a nice balance of being funny and genuinely emotional. There wasn't a weak link among them. The movie also benefits from appearances by Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader. I was surprised Cranston would join this project but with his history in the show, he showed up to work and held up his end. Bill is always funny and Alpha-5 is a decent side-kick character. The actress I liked best in the movie was Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa. She seemed like she was the one who really understood what the movie was going for. I'm a fan of hers, she has both comedic and dramatic chops in spades and she walked a delicate line between being a menacing villain and a scenery-chewing bad girl.I've had a lot of praise for Power Rangers so far but the movie does have a couple of problems. The first and probably the most important is that it can't escape how cheesy the show's subject matter was. They try to create realistic characters but the more fantastical elements of the show come off as corny. There were some times that I couldn't help but roll my eyes or laugh even sitting around serious fans. It stopped me from completely getting into the movie. The other thing is that Power Rangers might have the most obvious and ridiculous bit of product placement in a wide release movie that I've ever seen. It was actually jarring and impossible not to snicker at (I won't say what the company was but they must have paid a serious portion of the budget).The subject matter of Power Rangers seemed suited for younger kids but with how dark the subject matter is at specific points (there are scenes with Rita Repulsa that almost seem like they were lifted out of a horror movie), I wouldn't recommend it for really young children. This movie will play really well for fans, I saw it with a friend who was a big fan of the show and he left the theatre ecstatic. This movie was better than it had any right to be and I could easily see it jump-starting a franchise. I can't say I loved it but I would give it a solid 6.5/10 rounding up to a 7.","

Or at least don't come here and bash with bad reviews. I understand the personal opinion, but common. This is for kids and teenagers. It promotes good virtues and friendship. It has a old-timer story with Rita and good fighting the evil with some cool Zorgs. :) It really took me back to childhood, and that cannot be a bad thing. The old Kim and Tommy at the end got me even a bit emotional. :D Just kidding, I am really not a critic and it takes for a movie to be a really big piece of s*** for me not to like it. So, maybe, my review is not going to help those who haven't seen the movie. For me, it is good. If you want to lose yourself in an imaginary world for a couple of hours, go ahead. :)","

"borneobrian","23 November 2020","The film seems promising, with the power rangers being on the big screen again, but when you watch it, you'll feel robbed. The film lacks the fun campy tone of its source material and Feels dull and weak on its overall presentation. The performances are alright, but the character's personality's feel mixed up and not interesting to watch. The character, zord, and monster designs look almost nothing like they do in the show and it makes me wonder if these guys ever watched it. All in all, just watch the original show if you want satisfaction.","

"capone666","18 June 2017","Power RangersThe most important lesson Powers Rangers taught children was which colour represents which race.Sadly, that useful education tool has been omitted from this fantasy.When a disgraced quarterback (Dacre Montgomery), a troubled cheerleader (Naomi Scott), an autistic nerd (RJ Cyler), a lesbian loner (Becky G) and a momma's boy (Ludi Lin) unearth ancient colour coded coins they gain unimaginable powers.Aided by their new mentor (Bryan Cranston), his android (Bill Hader) and their vehicles that morph into a mega mecha, the quintet sets out to stop a former ranger (Elizabeth Banks) from finding the all-powerful Zeo Crystal. While this update of the Japanese super-hero kids' show manages to represent all races and special interests, its inconstant tone keeps it from telling an engaging story. The lack of mega-sized monsters is also concerning.Incidentally, the best way to keep colossal combatants off your building is to install massive bird spikes. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca","

"jonwycoco","14 December 2017","Acting is a little overdone, but then again so was the original. As a person who grew up with the show when it first aired, this rendition is meant to be another genesis story. Provide a little more background and bring it up to today's technological specs. While I think it tried too hard and perhaps did try to take itself a bit too seriously, if you come in with an open mind about it, you'll be somewhat surprised and may find that you enjoy it. I found that the camera angles and cinematography was okay, but it had moments where it felt very cheesy. If they could have picked up a really good director for action / sci-first (eg Whedon), we could have had a really excellent and fun movie. Alas, it falls slightly short of good. If you're looking for a bit of a campy movie with some good cheese factor, check it out. Otherwise, perhaps pass this one up.","

"chris-r-morgan-713-2589","27 March 2017","For the love of all that is decent and holy, this movie is an ORIGIN story. I keep hearing people talk about how they ""loved"" the movie, but they talk about all the things that the ""didn't see"" or ""wanted to see more of"". Forget the original series and the original movies, this is a REEEEBBBOOOOTTTT which means a complete retelling of the original story. It is not going to be exactly the same as before, do not judge this move based on what you think it should be or what the critics expect it to be. This is a restart of the franchise and if you take it as such there should be better reviews. They do not fight till the end, when they have over come all the other obstacles in their way. This is by far the way all origins stories should be done.","

"SnoopyStyle","15 July 2017","The Power Rangers led by Zordon battle Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) to protect all life on Earth and the Zeo Crystal. They send Rita to the bottom of the ocean but die in the process. Sixty five million years later, Jason Scott is the star high school quarterback in the fishing town Angel Grove. His prank turns into a high speed crash and life time of detentions. He saves peculiar Billy Cranston from a bully. He goes to the quarry with Billy and finds former cheerleader Kimberly Hart. Billy finds alien coins in the rocks. Along with Zack and Trini, the five teenagers turn into the new Power Rangers.The five fresh-faced kids are perfectly nice actors. Billy is marginally annoying at times but the kids sometimes have good exchanges. The characters should start with better chemistry. They should probably do a Breakfast Club before going off on their adventures. They need to be friends before breaking up and the inevitable reunion. There are attempts at humor and plenty of CGI action. This sort of works until it doesn't.","

"PetarNeo","4 April 2017","There was a huge anticipation for this movie and considering there was a 20 years between first on screen Rangers this was a potentially big hit but things went really in bad direction from the beginning. Dean Israelite gets a chance for his big directorial debut in this large scale movie but drops us a C-movie with not so good directing, which is choppy and doesn't gets us sucked enough to consider it to be a really enjoyable movie. Movie feels completely stolen from the writing forward and it there is a huge resemblance to other movies which starts to feel annoying and there is a constant pursuit for characters which could possibly add something good the movie. Jason Scott/Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery) is the problematic star of them all and his effort in uniting and starting to matter again is well done. Kimberly Hart/Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott) is probably the weakest part of movie because she tries matter in movie but her scenes are easily forgotten. Billy Cranston/Blue Ranger (RJ Cyler) was better part and there are quite few mysteries that resemble with him but RJ kept us interested in him because of his charisma and likeness that he brought with his character. Trini Kwan/Yellow Ranger (Becky G) was the most random character and everything about her feels artificial and she was a really bad add to the crew. Zack Taylor/ Black Ranger (Ludi Lin) brought some story with him that was actually helpful in his representation but it was all in vain because of his irritating and badly written actions that he featured. Alpha 5 is the best part of the movie because he was funny and always on high note with his actions and he stole every scene that he was in. Zordon (Bryan Cranston) was as good as was bad but he also lacked a importance and that resulted in meaningless scenes that weren't quite good. Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) was quite good in her portrayal and it was interesting to watch her but her character looks very funny shown on screen and there looks like she hasn't much power. Story behind whole Power Rangers looks ridiculous and there are large issues with many scenes that were shot and without many explanation. It felt like a bad movie with some cool tech but bad directing and probably good story that featured not so good acting and not giving us experience that was looked for. 1.5/4","

"TxMike","21 July 2017","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay. As such the picture and sound, Dolby Atmos, are top-notch. In fact my powered subwoofer was put through quite a workout from the opening scene and through the whole movie. Things in my viewing room were shaking!This amounts to an origin story for the Power Rangers. We see an opening scene of a great battle some millions of years back, the result being a giant machine and some colored tokens are buried deep in a mountain near a gold mine.We are introduced one by one to 5 different high school students, and when they are brought together by different reasons to the site on the mountain, when one of them ignites an explosive the innards are exposed and they discover the colored tokens, they each take one, and find out the next day they are super strong.There is a lot going on, hard to easily summarize, but they find out they must train and learn to morph into Power Rangers to successfully battle the evil woman and save the world.This isn't high art but it is made in an interesting manner. The last scenes feature a fierce battle, almost mandatory in this type of movie. But the young actors present themselves well and we come away feeling good about them.An interesting BluRay ""extra"" is a presentation of the history of the Power Rangers in cinema and TV. Amy Jo Johnson, now in her 40s, has a brief cameo in the movie near the end, she was one of the Power Rangers in the 1993 movie.","

"nenadperovic-1","16 June 2017","Seeing how insultingly low rating this movie has I gave it a 10 and I stand by it. Having watched this movie and having read the reviews for it I feel compelled to say something. This movie was never supposed to be serious or ""what is the meaning of life deep"". This is an excellent retelling of a classic story that some of was followed when we were kids. Granted the original was far far faaaar more ridiculous than this but it didn't matter when we were little kids. All we knew was, Rita-bad, rangers-good. So if you are going to watch this movie with the expectation that it will somehow change your view of the world or make you think, watch Life of Pi or something like that. But if you want to have a nostalgia moment and see your favorite childhood heroes kick some butt then I highly recommend this movie. It was great fun watching this on the big screen with a better script than any of the original rangers ever had. So if you want to have some fun, enjoy. If not, don't compare it to Schindler's list and tell me it sucks. Compare it to Iron man, Pacific Rim and then tell me how it good/bad it is. Different criteria for different types of movies people.","

"neontonysnowwinry","10 June 2017","It saddens me how people can be so picky for a movie that's meant to be a REBOOT. The cgi looked great, the story behind each character was quite deep and relatable. Also, there were many clips that explains the story of why the power rangers are formed and why the villain is attacking the city. The movie was not nostalgic BECAUSE it's a reboot, it's meant to create nostalgia for the new generation of fans, not us 90s spandex fanboys. I'm no movie expert which is why I may be slightly on the optimistic side but give the movie a go, it won't hurt if you just try it out and not listen to the picky critics","

I wanted this movie to be worse, to be honest, but the actors aren't that bad and the storyline, though extremely predicable, will appeal to those who haven't seen it a hundred times before. This movie just suffers from some pacing problems and a severe lack of energy.","

"ericstevenson","26 March 2017","I am impressed at how ""Power Rangers"" remains popular after all these years. I think I might have been a fan when I was really little, but I barely have any memories now. There really are a lot of good things about this movie but there are some parts that are just plain bad. I admit that the special effects didn't look too good from the trailers. On the big screen, they really are quite impressive! Seeing as how the show relied on stock footage from ""Super Sentai"", it really is great to see all new footage they made for this movie. I admit it's kind of weird to have a show known for being so campy be so serious here and grittier here, but it really did work well.I have to get to one thing that just weighs this film down like mad. An important part of the plot is that a crystal is located under a Krispy Kreme shop. Yeah, the continually show the Krispy Kreme logo over and over and it just makes it seem like a massive sellout. It's really some of the most blatant product placement I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, I am kind of in the mood to go there. This didn't need to be a part of the plot. If the crystal was in just some random place it would have made as much sense.It's also disappointing that the Power Rangers in full costume don't even appear until three fourths into the movie! Still, the battle scenes they did give us are fairly nice. I like the effect with Zordon and think Bryan Cranston was a good choice to play him. They even show a version of the awesome theme song. Again, not a fan, but boy is that a great song! Alpha is designed pretty well and I like his character. Unfortunately, it does seem like a lot of it is just an attempt for a long running series to stay relevant, but at least it doesn't rely on it that much. There's lots of good and bad things, but you should see it and judge for yourself. **1/2","

"westsideschl","15 July 2017","Positive: CGI good enough to entertain any mature under 16 teen & any immature under 21 teen. Everyone else, it's hopeless for you. Negatives: 1. This, and most of the other points indicate formula, already done a hundred times, story hooks. So let's begin with  2. Crystals that rule the Universe? And, they come in pretty plastic colors. By the way, do any of these writers have any education beyond 7th grade to realize how big the Universe is? 3. We need an evil one - right! In this case her name is Rita and she's like over 65 million years old, but doesn't look a day past 35 (she's going to like that). Rita likes to wear plastic Hollywood fantasy clothing with customary makeup to look ferocious. 4. Lots of excessively rational mind blowing coincidences in this movie like the five future heroes all show up at the same abandoned mine (and other places later on) at the same time. 5. Further coincidence, autistic spectrum nerd future hero happens to have some dynamite and happens to blow up the one location on Earth with the secret crystals. 6. Rita, coincidentally, happens to be dredged up from the deep ocean after 65 my looking only slightly bent out of shape (figuratively). 7. Dumb CGI of crystals levitating and vibrating and a tiresome old hook for mystery. 8. All happen to fall into a water hole that isn't all water, but does happen to have our alien spaceship and Transformer style dinosaur bods. 9. Happens to be a dumb (but they were trying to be funny) Alpha 5 robot that speaks English and has American juvenile humor and is also 65 my old. Calls our crystals ""coins"" for some reason and reminds everyone that ""The fate of the Universe"" is in the hands of teens; also known for their poor values. 10. Writer is doing the ethnicity hook (probably to get more monied viewers) of one ethnic for each crystal, ah coin. 11. Another attempt at humor is that Rita and Goldar (made out of guess what) are looking for the ultimate crystal of life which happens to be at the ultimate source of life Krispy Kreme. 12. Final scenes with dinosaur bots, swords (all this futuristic Universe saving tech and we're still using swords?), a slap (OK!) and wrestling (wrestling??). Conclusion: Is this the future of an educated America?","

"bestrochen","9 April 2017","I can see where they tried to make it similar, but different. However, I have not seen a movie this bad since the 3rd Spiderman Movie and Avatar The Last Air Bender live action that no one speaks of. Now I can't say its the worst cause I have seen worse, but its not worth the time to even watch it let alone pay to see in any theater. If you want something that is power rangers and okay, watch the original. The only things honestly good about the movie were their progressive inclusion of a LGBT and a young man on the Autistic spectrum. Thing is having these things does not make a movie good and though they are trying to keep their characters and ideas up today with changing culture. The movie concept was outdated to say the least and has been way overdone not just by every single series of the power rangers, but also every hero/action movie made since the 1990s. Stay at home, don't waist your money. Go watch Beauty and the Beast if anything.","

One thing I have loved about Mist if not all films is those films who make one patient for the action. One that takes time in character development, story, etc. when the rangers finally morphed it felt like I was 6 years old again watching the various power rangers series and movies. The films made one care for everyone who was tasked with being a ranger. That way when they finally have to fight Rita you feel as though you are there fighting right along side them.","

"thibault-li","29 July 2019","First, the characters are at least bland (Dacre Montgomery and Naomi Scott) and at worst annoying (RJ Cyler and Ludi Lin).
Elizabeth Banks who plays the villain does ham acting and looks ridiculous. She also has her share of cheesy lines and makes some very questionable choices.
Bryan Cranston is reduced as an pixel heap on a screen and came only for the paycheck I guess.
Don't expect some good characters developments, after all it's the director of Project X. Concerning direction, a lot of scenes are filmed too close to the actors.
We have to wait until lhe last fourth of the movie to finally see the heroes wearing their armours. Until then, it's quite boring. I laughed at one scene at the end of the final battle (which reminds me of Pokemon the series), then it's followed by a cringeworthy sequence which is meant to be cool, but fails I guess.Verdict : 4/10

"swilliky","26 March 2017","Updated and rebooted, the Power Rangers return to the big screen with some solid actors and a new set of teens to play the colorful superheroes. Following the general premise of the original show yet slightly askew, Jason (Dacre Montgomery) was a star football player who is injured in a car accident after pulling a prank and running from the police. Sent to detention, he meets Billy (RJ Cyler), an intelligent savant who pursues the mining hobby of his deceased father and Kimberly (Naomi Scott), a trouble popular girl. Convincing Jason to help him, Billy heads to a nearby mine to blow up an area he believes hides something special. Jason tries to ditch him but runs into Kimberly and they run back after hearing Billy's explosion. Also watching from a distance is Zack (Ludi Lin) who takes care of his young mother in a nearby trailer park and Trini (Becky G.), a loner who practices yoga amidst the rocks. The five teenagers discover colorful rocks and flee the mine security only to all crash in Billy's minivan with a train. They wake up not knowing what happened with incredible strength. Meanwhile, a fishing vessel picks up a corpse that comes alive to reveal the nefarious Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks). She is on a quest to gather as much gold to build her super soldier Goldar.

"franciscofernandes36","25 March 2017","First, movies do not all have to be ""dark"" or ""gore."" There is already too much darkness in the world and plenty of blood needlessly spilled. So I liked the comic tone and the energetic rhythm of the movie.In addition, a group of Power Rangers never had their personalities so exploited. The new Jason is a disgruntled hero quarterback who loves to get into trouble, the new Billy is a little genius who misses his father, the new Kimberly is a spoiled girl and plagued by a childish error, the new Zack is an impulsive shelves who is afraid of losing her mother and the new Trini is an outsider with some relationship problems. And what perfectly connect them? The loneliness that the five without exception feels in their hearts. This is the bond that unites them and forms them as a great group.We also have an introit with the story of Zordon's downfall - quite funny the way he and Jason both made mistakes as leaders - and the aiii! aai! aaai! ff Alpha 5 as comic relief.The weaker part of the film is evidently the third act and everything that concerns the villain. The suits / armor are cool and the zords too, but the villain Rita Repulsa, perhaps more for lack of script and ideas than for the demerit of the actress, does not really scare or pull our empathy. It's just one more that wants a crystal to dominate the world and the universe. Still, nothing that can not be remedied in a future sequel...However, for me, the essential thing for this film was to create a true Power Rangers team with a lot to explore in future films.And that was achieved, well done.The kids are very strong ... the power protects them.","

"zoliking","18 June 2017","Rating: 1/5 What earned the film the rating: Absolute lack of any originality, banal story-line, a conflict built on unbelievable coincidence and 0 effort in trying to make any sense.Comments The characters: There is 1 character in the film, Billy. He is a shallow character whose interestingness is derived from his mental condition which is never used by the writers in any meaningful way, but at least he can pass for what we would call a character. The rest of the people in the story are vanilla clichés with less depth than graphine. The other four rangers are attempts to pander to age/gender/racial demographics, Zordon is the stereotypical pretends-to-be-a-hard-ass-but-he-really-cares mentor stereotype and Rita's entire personality begins and ends with her quest for world domination through the destruction of Earth.The performances: As you can infer from the types of characters in the film, there weren't much room given to the actors to shine the mastery of their craft, but there are two notes worth mentioning: RJ Cyler's performance of Billy pretty much single handedly made it possible to bear through this thing while surprisingly enough Elizabeth Banks's attempts at being menacing came off as comical.The plot: It starts with a pile of coincidences where Rita happens to be discovered just as exactly 5 people randomly pop upon the 5 magic ranger crystals. Then it has a flat and almost conflict free build to the final battle which is a straight up face off with no tactical nuance that ends with an giant robot pulled straight from the writer's ass. Granted, bitch slapping the villain into space could have been a bad-ass end, but the amount of randomness, silliness and emotional emptiness that surrounds that moment takes away its edge.The lack of any sense: Just a few of the major plot points that are left completely unexplained: Where do the rangers and their magic stones come from? Are there more like them in distant quadrants of space? If so, when Zordon's group disappeared, why didn't anybody come looking for the magic crystals? If not, then are the 6 of them responsible to guard every life crystal in every inhabited planet in the galaxy? If Rita can come back to life then how does being sunk in the ocean prevent her from doing so? Why did she sink in the first place? If she sank how could she have been caught up in a fishing net submerged to a depth where schools of fish swim? If Rita is the green ranger turned evil, then why are her powers completely and radically different from the others'? Why would the rangers morphing allow Zordon to come back to life? Why does it allow Billy to come back to life? Why is there a limit of 1 on coming back to life if the rangers can morph more than once? What are all the mundane authorities of the USA doing while a weird looking alien is killing people and blowing stuff up in small town America? When Rita captures the rangers what makes her spare the life of 4? How does the robots combining increase their power rather than simply limiting their mobility? If pulling the crystal unleashes a devastation of multitudinous nuclear explosions, and Rita is happy to stand in the epicenter of all that does it mean she could withstand that force?","

"01rogue","12 August 2017","I expected this movie to be another kiddie show with endless, senseless fight scenes, no character development and a body count higher than all of earth's wars put together. However though, I found I could relate to and care for all of the kids and while Rita was a rather typical villain she did express true belief and feeling in her bizarre and twisted behavior.I think most of the people giving such awful reviews for this should stop and consider that sometimes movies get made for adults. Not just for marvel or dc fan-boys and text addled school kids, but for people who are mature, intelligent and have some life experience behind them.As for those who think it sends a bad message to kids, I think the opposite. I think it well portrays the fact of life that even though you have made mistakes as a teenager you are still young and capable of great and amazing comebacks. It also shows how little support for their kids modern parents have, believing themselves to be all knowing even though they clearly have no idea what's up with their own kids and in the end make everything worse. Bad parenting starts and ends at home people, get over blaming the movies and everyone else. It's you who set the standards and morals your children grow up with and if they can't watch a movie without it unbalancing their values and self belief, that's your fault.","

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","4 July 2017","In the early 1990s, the Power Rangers TV show was a big thing when it came out. With its big action set pieces and varying evil characters to combat, many kids found the show to be a lot of fun growing up. Since then the show has continued to be superseded by different kinds of rangers. The style and execution of the show very much remained the same but the difference was in the designs and settings. Every few years seemed like a new version of the Power Rangers were being made. Prior to that, two movies were made featuring the original rangers. Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie (1995) and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie both attempted to bring about more fans but only succeeded with the first. The show was what really kept the franchise afloat. Being that it's so popular though, producers finally thought it was time to reboot the series with a brand new film. Modernization of the characters, suits, and villains were something that was bound to happen. In the end, it was alright.Seeing that this is a reboot film, the script was handled as an origin story. Written by John Gatins, audiences are introduced to a bunch of misfits that can't seem to find a break in their lives. Jason (Dacre Montgomery) is a football player who just blew is last shot at getting a scholarship for a dumb prank he tried to pull. Kim (Naomi Scott) was once a cheerleader who made an ill-fated social media post that got her in trouble. Billy (RJ Cyler) is just a book worm techie and gets caught in the wrong situations. Zack (Ludi Lin) and Trini (Becky G.) are both outsiders who try to stay as secluded as possible from the town they live in. Before they know it, they cross paths together after discovering mystical colored coins. Upon making this discovery, they then run into Alpha 5 (Bill Hader) and Zordon (Bryan Cranston), the original owners of the glowing coins. There they learn what the power rangers were all about and that an ex ranger by the name Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) must be stopped before she destroys their world.The development of the main leads are adequate. Although they make questionable decisions at first, viewers can get attached to them. The actors portraying those characters do an acceptable job. With the cast only having big name actors as the supporting roles, this gives ample time for the lesser-known thespians to shine. Out of that group, nobody takes the spotlight more than the other. They all have their moments to grow and that's always a sign the writer is thinking properly. What doesn't make sense though is that once these individuals start to train as power rangers, everyone in school treats them exactly the opposite. That's not realistically believable. On top of that Billy is a wiz at almost everything and even discovers an important plot device that Repulsa is looking for. How he finds is not explained and makes no sense. Putting that aside though, the rest of the storytelling is decent. Gatins was also the writer to Real Steel (2011), Need for Speed (2014) and Kong: Skull Island (2017).The direction was also competently controlled by Dean Israelite. What's more surprising is that Israelite had only directed one other theatrical feature which had a much smaller budget and only made twice as much back. The film was Project Almanac (2015), which was released in late January. When movies are released then, most are because they are not very good films. But all the power to Israelite for moving up. The action sequences that begin to occur around the middle of the film are well staged. Any CGI that was used in those scenes were also rendered effectively not to look fake. One of the more unique designs was to Repulsa's Goldar. Made completely of molten liquid gold, the flow of how the liquid gold moves is not seen on many creatures. The power ranger suits was another change that was done in order to not date the costume. This worked in their favor because although it's metallic armor, it looks much more durable than to that of the older style suits. Like they actually could take a beating.Camera-work for this film was a mixed bag however. Shot by Matthew J. Lloyd, the cinematography is a hybrid of shaky cam, rotating panoramic shots and traditional shooting. The classical filmmaking parts were fine; nothing to mention there. The shaky cam and rotating shots are another problem. Shaky cam is always an issue because the motions can be nauseating even if the idea is to create realism. As for the rotating shots, it can get very dizzying. Lloyd got some professional shots but anything else is nothing to be impressed with. He also filmed for Cop Car (2015) and Project Almanac (2015). Rounding out the technical elements was music composed by Brian Tyler. In the past, Tyler's music has been used for many different action films and here it sounds very stock in its own way. For some reason he doesn't translate the Power Rangers main theme but it's not all neglected. Tyler seems to have taken an alternate approach to his music. In certain areas, cues will sound close Daft Punk's sound. Interesting.Modernizing the power rangers franchise wasn't a bad idea at all. Much of the work put into this feature manages to stand out with relatively necessary development of characters. The action is permissible and the music fits the genre to a degree. The only problem is the script misses some key points and the cinematography is uneven in presentation.","

"justin-fencsak","29 July 2017","When Power Rangers first came out on TV in the early 90s, no one never knew that it was an Americanized version of the Super Sentai Japanese TV shows from the 70s and 80s. Saban took footage from the series, dubbed it, and blended it in with American scenes to make a TV shows that became an icon of afternoon children's TV and spawned two movies, video games, and merchandise, not to mention controversy from politicans who thought the show was too violent. The 2017 version of this movie, coming out a few years after a Youtuber made a darker take on the show in a short film, is a perfect reboot in an age of bad reboots this decade. The casting is great, and the main villain is more sexier than the last time she was on TV. The visual effects are amazing, the soundtrack great, and the pacing of the movie is pretty good. There's also a John Hughes-esque feel in this movie, kinda similar to Spider-Man Homecoming, and there's a bonus scene after the main credits that sets up a possible sequel, which based on home media sales and rentals, might happen if Lionsgate has the money to make it.","

"nargon","28 April 2023","I think Power Rangers fans went into this film with the wrong expectations of what it would be, and were therefore dissapointed. If all you want is the 1995 film with a bigger budget, you will not get it here. What you will get is a thoughtful, patient look at the lives and troubles of five young people who learn not only the value, but also the nessesity of finding meaningful human connection, and the beauty of true friendship. Because in this movie, these are actual teenagers with actual attitude. After we've done that, it's 20 minutes of great looking heart pounding action the likes of which the show could never achieve. It, unlike most movies today, does not use nostalgia as a crutch, rather it dares to try something new and unique, keeping the heart of its source material, if not always the look. A sequel could have given us more morphed action, introduced a fan favorite character, and continued more in the vein of that the original show. Sadly, if Ranger Nation continues to be upset because the film dared to give the infallible TV show characters some flaws and depth, we may never see Power Rangers rise to it's full potential.","

"scottingram","26 March 2017","The new action film Power Rangers the newly rebooted film based on the hit and hugely popular 90's US TV Series about a group of teenagers superheroes who have to keep the planet Earth safe from the forces of evil starring Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks.In Power Rangers Saban's Power Rangers follows five ordinary high school kids Jason Scott (Australian actor Dacre Montgomery - Safer Neighborhood, A Few Less Men), Billy Cranston (American actor RJ Cyler - Me And Earl And The Dying Girl, US TV Series Vice Principals), Kimberly Hart (English actress Naomi Scott - The 33, TV Series Terra Nova), Asian actor Ludi Lin (TV Series Marco Polo, Monster Hunt) as Zack, American actress Becky G (US TV Series Empire, House Of Sin) as Trini who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove – and the world – is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat led by the evil Rita Repulsa (American actress Elizabeth Banks - Pitch Perfect films, Spider-Man films). Chosen by destiny by Zordon (American actor Bryan Cranston - US TV Series Breaking Bad, Total Recall 2012) who is a big talking face on a computer screen and his trusty sidekick Alpha 5 (voiced by American actor Bill Hader - Trainwreck, Men In Black 3), our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet by becoming The Power Rangers with Jason becoming the Red Ranger, Billy becoming the Blue Ranger, Kimberly becoming the Pink Ranger, Zack becoming the Black Ranger and Trini becoming the Yellow Ranger. But to do so they will have to overcome their real-life issues and band together as the Power Rangers before it is too late.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Power Rangers include American actor Matt Shively (Paranormal Activity 4, April Apocalypse) as Damo, Cody Kearsley (TV Series Riverdale) as Hawkeye, American actor David Denman (13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi, After Earth) as Sam Scott Jason's dad, Robert Moloney (Random Acts Of Romance, The Revenant) as Ted Hart Kimberly's dad, English actress of Indian descent Anjali Jay (The Age Of Adaline, Blind Dating) as Maddy Hart Kimberly's mum, Canadian actress Sarah Grey (TV Series Legends Of Tomorrow, Cinemanovels) as Amanda, Canadian actress Morgan Taylor Campbell (Sadie's Last Days On Earth, No Men Beyond This Point) as Harper, Canadian actress Caroline Cave (Saw VI, One Week) as Beverly Scott, Canadian actress Kayden Magnuson (TV Series Chesapeake Shores, Monkey Up) as Pearl Scott, Canadian actress Lisa Berry (The Colony, No Stranger Than Love) as Candace Cranston Billy's mum, John Stewart (US HorrorTV Series Fear The Walking Dead which is a spin-off of the US Horror TV Series The Walking Dead, Walking Tall) as a detention teacher, Fiona Fu (TV Series Blood And Water) as Zack's mum, English actor Garry Chalk (Godzilla 2014, Freddy vs. Jason) as Captain Bowen, Canadian actor Patrick Sabongui (TV Series The Flash and Homeland) as Trini's dad and Canadian actress Erica Cerra (TV Series The 100, Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief) as Trini's mum.Power Rangers was filmed on location in the province of British Columbia in Canada the second largest country in the world.Overall Power Rangers is a good action film filled with action, violence, shooting, fighting, battling, explosions, things getting blown up, wrecked, destroyed etc, team work, togetherness, problem troubled teenagers, sci-fi, science, incredible technology, weird bizarre things, quarries, stunning scenery, crowds of people, fall outs, disagreements, loyalty, family, friendship, on the edge of your seat stuff, waterfalls, rain, trains, cars, zords, incredible powers of strength and many other things throughout the film.So I will give Power Rangers an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Power Rangers is worth seeing if you are a fan of the Power Rangers TV Series from the 90's and the two Power Rangers films that followed suit in 1995 and 1997, Chronicle, Project Almanac, Avengers films, Transformers films, X-Men films amongst others. So if get the chance to see Power Rangers in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later and I should mention that I watched the Power Rangers TV Series from the 90's when it use to be on the TV on Sky One on the DJ Kat Show and just on its own and I was a big Power Rangers fan growing up and I was addicted to the TV Series which ran in the UK from 1994 until about 1997 which was titled Mighty Morphin Power Rangers which I watched on the TV day in day out week in week out and I had all the toy zords like the first Megazord which was made of the dino zords, the thunder zords that made up the Thunder Megazord, the ninja zords that made up the Ninja Megzord, the shogun zords that made up the Shogun Megazord, the Power Rangers figures, some of the monsters etc. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV Series ran for three seasons before it became Power Rangers Zeo which I watched in 1997 then it became Power Rangers Turbo which I watched for a bit but I couldn't get in to it and then I lost track of Power Rangers after that. But I do still have fond memories of watching Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Power Rangers Zeo but nothing the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV Series that ran for three seasons from 1994 until 1997 when Power Rangers Zeo came in to force on UK TV screens and so on.","

"Bulldog1721","27 March 2017","I just saw this movie last Saturday and I thought this movie was a great tribute to my childhood and to everyone that grew up in the 90s. Kids will love the action and adventure of this magnificent and sword-swinging story of 5 teens who braved conquest of making it through high school with different personalities and abilities. Each of them had a story to tell and creates an energetic flow from this reboot that creates a connection with the millennials!The only drawback was the spread of crude language in various parts, overall, it was 1/2 of the drama and 1/2 of the action! A great ticket seller for big Power Rangers fans and I thought that this was better than Beauty and The Beast! This is a better alternative than sitting through 2 hours of singing and the utmost respect of the fairy tale!Awesome Reboot!!!!!!!!!!!! Give it a chance and save Beauty and the Beast for later!!!","

"jhaddan","20 July 2017","Warning: Spoilers! First off, I can remember when the very first episode of Power Rangers came on. I grew up with the original and following versions of Power Rangers. I loved it as did most kids I grew up with. I'll be honest; I did not want to watch the movie. Or maybe I'd watch it once it casually came out on Netflix or Hulu. However, my younger brother talked me into watching it and I wasn't disappointed. It felt like the original Power Rangers movie but they said, let's take out all the child like moments and reinsert young adult moments/reactions into, which made sense to me. After all, the power rangers where in high school. Is it a safe clean kid's movie? No, it isn't. But it made it better. Changes to the Franchise.I was on the fence about Alpha-5. He looked awkward to me. The voice didn't work for me either. I guess I was still expecting to see and hear the original Alpha-5. They could have at least left him the same. However, Zordon and Rita, being former rangers, was great. I don't remember any backstory, for them in the original show. Both were more relatable. Even though the original Rita was iconic, with her annoying voice and elaborate costume, the new Rita nailed it. Elizabeth Banks version was fantastic; completely unrecognizable. For once, it seemed Rita was in control and a total bad a**. Zordon to me, took a little time to warm up to. I did. I love how they explained why he is stuck inside the crystals and how he didn't have total faith in the new team. The rangers also had their backstory told which I thought was great. I didn't realize that until this movie; we really had not been told their story. The costumes in all the promotional material looked like crap. They honestly reminded me of the CGI effects from the original Power Rangers movie. Way too shiny! However, in the movie, they looked great. No complaints. The Zords felt like the old Zords. Still great! Overall, I think this reboot did a great job! They even snuck in the original Power Ranges theme song, lightning bolt and even set up Rita to live in outer space in the next movie; which I hope they make! Now, how anyone can give this movie one or two stars, I'm not sure. Unless they were paid to do so. I'll give this nine stars because they kept intact the original, iconic material, while making it more grown up which is essentially all any Power Ranger fan wanted. Just take the cheesy-ness out of SABANS Power Rangers and make it more real. Watch it and enjoy the movie for what it is.","

"classicsoncall","18 April 2017","For me personally, this was a movie choice of last resort with my two pre-teen grand kids tagging along. We had to whittle down our selection to a film no one had seen yet. So I missed out on The Smurfs and Boss Baby once again; maybe that wasn't such a bad idea. Anyway, this is not a picture I would have gone to under any other circumstances, and there's no obligatory admission here that it was better than what I thought it would be. The entire story is aimed directly at the teenage market with a rainbow coalition of characters that's even referenced by someone in the story as being 'different colors, different kids, different colored kids'. So the whole multiculturalism aspect is addressed here, with a nod to the idea that autism doesn't have to be a hindrance for someone who wants to be productive and make a difference. In fact, it was the autistic teen Billy (RJ Cyler) who first attained the morphing ability crucial to the teens acquiring their Power Ranger status. With a threat to the planet and a villainess bent on global domination, the latter part of the picture turned into a garish display of battle action and destruction on a scale meant to outdo the last movie that just came out, take your pick. The young teens win out naturally, with their message of misfits sticking together for a worthwhile cause. If you catch your fair share of super-hero flicks, you've already seen it dozens of times. For this viewer, I couldn't even count on a nostalgia factor in watching this film; even though the first Power ranger vehicle came out in 1993, my roots go all the way back to ""The Adventures of Superman"" from the Fifties. I guess I'll stick with the DC and Marvel films looking ahead.","

"oscaralbert","29 March 2017",". . . ""Krispy Kreme's"" logo seems to be on-screen during POWER RANGERS for more than an hour. The main villain of this flick is shown chowing down on one of the featured KK (or is it ""KKK""?) donuts an hour, 37 minutes, and 25 seconds into this yawner. (When's the last time that you've enjoyed a GOOD movie in which a main character lingered over a pastry that close to the climax? About the only Dunker Scene of note in the Annals of Film was the infamous shootout in BOOGIE NIGHTS, and that comes at the beginning of the show.) If I want to spend an hour at Krispy Kreme, I'll drive to one. However, I'm not so sure I'll venture over there again in the foreseeable future, because my last three trips saw me arriving with KK's logo lit up, which means my car load expected the promised ""free"" treat each time. Tragically, ""fancy"" filled donuts were rolling off KK's assembly line in each instance, and they say that they will only give away the ""original glazed"" ones for Gratis when their sign is lit up! In the field of Consumer Fraud, this is what's known as a ""Bait and Switch"" Gimmick. Anyone suffering this apparently typical KK experience must boycott BOTH Krispy Kreme AND Power Rangers!","

"adam111111","28 June 2017","I was expecting very, very little from this movie. In addition to the Michael Bay-style CGI extravaganza that I was thinking was going to be there, there was also a great deal of other stuff going on, like some stock-issue teenage drama and extensive promotional materials from Krispy-Kreme. That last note was particularly weird, and the fact that the secret to preserving the entire earth was under a Krispy-Kreme. Incidentally, there were at least three extended shots of people gleefully eating doughnuts from, where else, Krispy-Kreme.This is not a particularly original movie. It does not stretch the limits of film as art, nor is it particularly funny or exciting. It is a solid movie though, and one that is worth watching, if offered.","

Like I said, not a fan, the series missed my demographic when it came out but I knew the gist of it. The movie gives some back story as to how the Rangers came to Earth and also to the individual characters which gave the movie some heft. The Rangers alter egos have personality instead of the squeaky clean drones on the TV show. Also, hits all the buttons-training sequence, bonding scenes, slow mo hero walk (I think we get two). Brian Cranston has a good, almost cameo, essentially a face on a wall thru' the movie. Violent fights but no blood and the characters stop just short of vulgar language, had no problem letting my son watch. Only two gripes that suspension of belief can handle- 1)a being come from another galaxy and her name is Rita Repulsive? 2)a Ranger fights Rita in a bedroom at night, and no parents run into the room?","

"destroyerwod","27 August 2018","So i decided i was gonna go full spoiler for this review cause lets face it, if you watched the show in the 90s you already know what Power Rangers is. I would like to start by the negatives and finish on the positives. So first of all i am not a fan of the race swapping they did for the main characters. I supose its to please the SJWs and commit to our ""political correctness era"" wich i am not fond of, but in the end it just make the movie a bit weird without a good reason. So right out the bat Jason and Kimberly are done right. There a bit more flawed than the show happy goodies version, but they are close enough. The problem comes with the yellow, blue and black rangers that they race swapped. So basically Billy is now african-american, Zack is asian and Trini is hispanic. Its kinda funny how they mention Jason, Kim and Billy's last name but never do it for Zack or Trini. Lets just say Trini Kwan does not sound very hispanic and Zack Taylor does not sound very asian either. When it comes to Billy his genius persona is kept but for Zack and Trini they go opposite direction. Now i think changing them a bit to make a more original movie is fine, but they didn't need to race swap them for that. Zack could had still be african-american and act differently. Anyway rant on this is over. When it comes to the other changes like for instance having Zordon as the original Red Ranger and Rita as the original Green Ranger, i think it worked very fine. The movie set up a possible sequel to introduce Tommy and they could do the geen ranger saga perfectly that way. Rita's new appearance didn't bother me either. On the other hand i wish Goldar would had been closer to the show version, as in a monster in a gold armor instead of just a faceless gold monster. Also another issue i had with the movie was that despite being called Power Rangers, they barely are in the suits only for the final act and most of it happen in the Zords. I would had love to see more hand to hand fights in there power suits and maybe show there unique weapons for all Rangers and not just Jason. But despite all i just said, actually the movie is fairly entertaining. I wish i would had seen more ""rangers"" but the character developement and the bonding between the characters was actually handle well. Instead of being all friends like at the beginning of the old show, they are all different and come together due to circonstances. They get to know each other with time and develop there friendship and eventually realize they need each others. I enjoyed that aspect. The final act was also very well done, i love seeing the Zords fight individually as we saw very few of that in the show. The new Megazord was cool too. In the end i actually had more fun than i tough i would with the movie and despite my negatives wich seem bigger than the positives in this review, i would rate the movie positively. As a fan of the show i actually enjoyed the new looks of the rangers(even if so few of them), the new zords/megazord, Ritas and even Alpha wich i was not fond of in the first promo photos, i think he came out very ok in the movie. I really hope they eventually do a sequel. Especially since they set it so well. I recommand that you watch this with a few beers tough (if you are of age obviously) and it made me got more into the movie that i think i would if i didn't drank.","

Although some scenes were cringy (no spoilers) and the monsters could've been different (like the gold one) and more presentable, it was still good to see.... now i don't know if the monsters were like that originally (cause, not a fanboy) but the main villain could've fought better for someone who took down tougher rangers.

"Mike_Devine","31 March 2018","Long ago, the Power Rangers were an insanely popular force to be reckoned with. Nowadays, they're only really good for 30-something fanboys who are feeling nostalgic, despite the fact that there have been iterations upon iterations of series developed to keep interest alive.In 2017's 'Power Rangers,' Lionsgate aimed to recharge the aging franchise by injecting young up-and-coming actors and a healthy dose of CGI in the hopes of capturing success a la 'Transformers.' Unfortunately, the quality here fell way short of expectations, with cheesy dialogue, cheap action sequences and poor acting. From an acting perspective, the young troupe of actors deliver boring performances as misfit teenagers turned quasi-superheroes. The only real bright spot is Elizabeth Banks' portrayal of the alien witch Rita Repulsa, who has been reimagined to be a fierce killer bent on destroying Earth. The vocal talents of Bryan Cranston (as Zordon) and Bill Hader (as Alpha 5) are pretty much throwaways and don't amount to much here,Another flaw in 'Power Rangers' is its pacing. The film starts out very slow, then seems to sprint through the rest of the sequence of events in the blink of an eye. The little character development that happens is focused on the imperfections of each ranger's life and why they want to escape their struggles for something better. Sure, it's fair to say there are a lot of social and societal lessons and commentaries baked into 'Power Rangers,' but these do nothing to elevate the film as a whole. Even the final moments of the climactic battle are underwhelming.While credit is probably due for making another attempt to breathe life into 'Power Rangers,' the execution here is poor. When it comes to making movies about well-established pop culture subjects, that really hurts.","

"danielharden","1 April 2017","Based on Haim Saban's campy, B movie styled kids show, comes an attempt at a more realistic and darker (in colour) version of the Power Rangers. Directed by Dean Israelite and starring RJ Cyler, Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks, this Power Rangers movie tries to be different and have substance, distancing itself from the campy fun of the original Rangers. But the end result is quite bland and cliché with few new aspects working.The best part of this film by far is RJ Cyler's performance as Billy, an autistic boy who lost his dad and who becomes the Blue Ranger. Following his brilliant role as Earl in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Cyler is yet again likable and funny but in a completely different way. Billy is the only ranger you particularly care for and I credit this to Cyler's great performance.While on this topic it's worth noting that the other ranger's don't act particularly badly, they just aren't given much to work with. Red Ranger Jason and Pink Ranger Kimberly are really bland characters and unfortunately they get the most screen time. These characters are nothing more than archetypal straight couple leads in many a film before this, and won't be remembered in any way after the credits role. Also Zack and Trini feel as if they are only there for the sake of numbers, they are given a bit of development but they are clearly ranger number 4 and 5.As well as their being good acting on display by RJ Cyler, there is also some below average acting in this film mainly by Elizabeth Banks. Elizabeth Banks plays antagonist Rita Repulsa in a rather over the top performance. Although being loyal to the source material by doing this, it does however go against the more grounded and realistic approach this film aimed for, and thus the conflict between whether the film should be more realistic or unrealistic begins.For the majority of this film it focuses on the bonding of the Rangers. This could have been done a lot better if the characters written were more compelling. This is also why I rate RJ Cyler's performance so highly, because he had to carry the majority of the film for me. The best scene in the film was the campfire scene as we actually get offered some substance, but unfortunately it trails off when it gets to our two boring leads. Zack, Trini and Billy are given a moment that allows the audience to engage with them whereas Jason and Kimberly remain boring by being tight lipped and this annoyed me.Once Morphed the film takes a nose dive, descending into a cheesy final act with some less than stellar visual effects. The visual effects didn't fit in with the real surroundings at all and made the film look fake and cheap. Also I have to mention the world's most subtle product placement that Krispy Kremes was given. If you aren't laughing right now then you clearly haven't seen the film. The product placement for Krispy Kremes is almost as bad as McDonald's in Mac and Me. There may not be a dance number in a Krispy Kreme, but Rita does take a break from the action to enjoy a good old donut.Overall, Power Ranger's is contradictory in what it wants to be. Director and studio obviously had different ideas, but in the end the studio won as evidenced by Krispy Kreme's role in the film. With a strong performance by RJ Cyler and no one else, the film struggled to keep me engaged even though attempts were made to make the film interesting. Now set up for a sequel as all blockbusters are nowadays and all I can say is, ""NO NO POWER RANGERS!""","

It's a boring, pretty rubbish authorless clone of much better bad movies.In fact I think I can confidently say that Power Rangers: The Movie is more entertaining and memorable than this hokey bodge-job.None of the attempts at realism gels with the tropes and recognisable traits of the TV series.Also it uses an 8 year old Kanye West track during the climax fight.This movie is a travesty.","

Story = Pathetic, Action = Pathetic, Acting = Pathetic They had everything at their finger tips to make a great movie but they blew it completely...all aspects of this was bad.Don't watch this, it'll ruin the Power Rangers you remember from the 90's.","

"sparrowcourt","21 June 2017","I don't understand what all the bad reviews are on this movie. I overall thought this was a great movie. It has everything to make it a good movie, humor action and true friendship. Power rangers has been a movie that everyone has tried to remake, as for this remake I feel as if its worth watching. You can have your own opinion, but I loved it and think they did a great job on this.","

"tyleramato-28680","25 March 2017","""Power Rangers"" is yet another product of Hollywood's reboot machine which aims to take something silly and turn it into something grounded and gritty, but if you're gonna take something in a more serious direction, you damn well better stick to it, and tonally ""Power Rangers"" is a gigantic, if not somewhat enjoyable mess that tries to bite off more than it can chew. Power Rangers' biggest draw is easily its young and talented cast of colorful characters, including the once High School Football prodigy turned hooligan, Jason Scott played by Dacre Montgomery, the socially awkward Billy Cranston played by RJ Cyler, the mysterious Trini played by Becky G, the reckless Zack played by Ludi Lin, and resident bad girl, Kimberly Hart played by Naomi Scott. The five young actors have instant chemistry together and all have something different to offer to the film, Bryan Cranston also turns in a fantastic portrayal of Zordon, Bill Hader provides solid voice work for Alpha 5, and Elizabeth Banks chews up the scenery as main baddie Rita Repulsa, whose diabolical plan is to build a giant monster out of...gold? Called Goldar? To find a crystal buried under a Krispy Kreme in the town of Angel Grove? Sounds grounded and serious, doesn't it? And yes, you heard right, Krispy Kreme is an integral part to the film...totally not joking here, folks. It's a shame how well the first half of the film worked in contrast to its second half, but that's what happens when you have five different people working on the script. Cliché as it may seem but more truly is less in the case of ""Power Rangers"".","

"minionking777","30 June 2017","I was a child of the nineties, and as such, I loved the power rangers and wanted to be one. (I still want to be one!) This reboot takes all the vital elements of the original power rangers and gives them creative depth and meaning. All the kooky cheesiness was replaced by realism and plausibility. This movie adds the ""why"" and ""how"" to all the ""what."" The characters (rangers) are more like real people than the original goody-goodies of old. Rita's and Goldar's reinvention is nothing short of art. I worried that this movie would deviate too far or in the wrong way, but it made all the right moves. Don't listen to the trolls and haters; this movie rocked! I desperately hope for sequels!(In short, it's like going from Adam West's Batman to Christian Bale's Batman.)","

"cgearheart","16 April 2019","This movie is the perfect example of people being way too hard on a movie. I'm even a little surprised that it bombed because I loved it so much. Sure, it was thinly written and the Rangers didn't show up for quite some time, but who cares! It was very entertaining, had an awesome message about friendship and bonding together, the acting was very solid. In my opinion, this film was no different than movies like ""Captain Marvel"" or ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"".C+","

"Noahflanny","23 March 2017","I didn't come in to this film expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised when the film began with a very nice start. The build-up and introduction of the first few characters was very well paced and I started to become more interested in the movie, even if it was a generic ""outcast is special"" scenario. Unfortunately, just as I was starting to gain interest, the film started to lose its speed. As I mentioned before, the first few rangers introduced were done very well, and I even felt a bit invested in these characters. The remaining rangers, however, seemed to be awkwardly shoved into the plot. With little to no background given other then that they just happened to be in the right place at the right time with the other characters. The acting was also not that great in some areas either. Especially Dacre Montgomery as the Red ranger. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't a horrible pick for the leading ranger, he just could have done better in some moments. You can definitely pick out the times when the acting was very poor. Another thing to note is that the pacing felt off at times. The first half was set up very nicely, with good introduction to the world we were being introduced too, but what the film does wrong after that is it takes the audience's new knowledge of this world and shoves the climax of the film in our face. One second the protagonists are on their knees clearly defeated with no real answer on how to win, and then, in what feels like less than a minute or two, they're an unstoppable force that no one can defeat. My friends and I were laughing the entire duration of the climax, it was just so ridiculous and off paced we couldn't help it. Overall, not the greatest movie. I could go more in depth about the action and antagonist but that just reaffirms what I already said. I will admit that the film it had its good and funny moments, especially the first half. Go see it if you've got nothing else to do and want to laugh at some corny jokes. Otherwise I'd recommend seeing or doing something else with your free time and wait till it hits redbox.","

"TheMovieDiorama","11 March 2018","The attempted reboot of another franchise...that no one asked for. In a decade where Marvel rules the saturated superhero genre, there is no requirement for more especially when it's filled with mediocrity. Having no prior knowledge to the 'Power Rangers' franchise, this is a review strictly critiquing the film alone. Five students come across strange coins that lead to an underground spaceship eventually granting them the abilities of Power Rangers. They must learn to work together as a unit in order to prevent evil forces from destroying Earth. Now, let's whip out the old ""Superhero Check List"". Ready? Alright, here we go. Origin story (or stories) where the main character(s) must harness their new found ability? Check. Evil villain wanting to destroy the world for no apparent reason? Oh yes. A CGI disposable army? Yup, rock monsters this time! Leaving the story open for countless sequels? Naturally. There is not a single original idea, even when using such rich source material. It borrows elements from various other films and unfortunately does nothing inventive with them. Four bland protagonists and one who actually has some personality (the blue ranger, but you knew that anyway) lead a boring story filled with clichés and a formulaic structure. There's a moment where our characters sit down and say ""let's get to know each other"" as if the script forces character development right before your eyes. No natural progression, it's all artificial nonsense. I did like the design of the morphing suits and the advanced technology made for some inventive gadgetry. Although, for such an expensive film I'm surprised that the visual effects were frequently poorly executed. Obvious green screen was obvious. The constant use of slow motion was jarring, particularly during combat scenes. And then we get to the antagonist...ohhhh Elizabeth Banks. What are you doing here? A pantomime villain who's motives are not explored, just destroying the world because why not! What can I say except the film is unnecessary.","

"TharsheyN","26 July 2021","So before I even start my review I will say that I've never watched anything Power Rangers before. The most I'd seen is maybe an episode or two of the show when I was like 8 years old.The movie starts off pretty interesting though it does take a bit long before any of the action. However I don't mind this at all, as they take time to setup the world and the characters and I would honestly not have minded another 30m or so off world building and character building if they had gone that route.The storyline is nothing special and is pretty basic, however what brings me back to this movie every time, and I've watched it like 5 times now, is the relationship that's built between the Rangers. It's the best part of the film and each time I watched the film seeing the Rangers becoming friends and then family is really amazing. The best performance while everyone did do a good job goes hands down to A. J. Cyler aka Billy Cranston. He does an amazing job with his role and steals the spotlight every time.I know there was a general hint at the red ranger and pink ranger aka Naomi Scott and Dacre Montgomery having a romantic relationship at some point. However it was mostly cut from the film besides the slow building of their relationship throughout the film. However I disagree and actually would prefer to see Dacre/Red Ranger do his whole solo leader stint and allow Billy and Kimberly to get together... I know probably everyone reading this will disagree and that's fine but that's how much I liked the Blue Ranger/Billy.The rest of the cast as said before do admirable jobs and the special effects while not anything mind blowing are also pretty great.All in all the movie is fun to watch and I'll be rewatching it soon as well, just because I like the family (laughs in Dominic Torreto) dynamic they have going on between the Rangers, even I I don't agree on all the relationships they try to set up.8/10 from me and if you're a fan of the old PR series I wouldn't recommend this to you if you thinking nostalgia before watching, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to see a Power Rangers reboot or Origin story as this is pretty much what it is!","

"Oberrated","25 March 2017","I was hyped to see this movie. My childhood was going to be relived with this new take on the original series and to be honest, I was pretty satisfied with what I saw by the time the movie came to an end. Characters I loved in new form, a dope new style of armor (which has been hotly debated but how is that a turning point for a movie being bad or not? P*** off), and quite an entertaining bit of material throughout the film in regards to comedy and action. So no doubt, 'Power Rangers' was an entertaining film from my perspective. However, everything was not all rainbows and butterflies. The story progression was sporadic throughout the film. I felt as if the film had a hard time balancing the whole serious tone and the imminent Earth's destruction between the OhEmGee teen drama that was supposed to instill a deep emotional heart-string pluck (although I did feel for Zack (Ludi Lin) the Black Ranger because I'm a mommas boy). Let us also not forget the music video film constantly blaring out mainstream tunes at inopportune moments. Sorry, the last thing I want to listen to is Kanye West's ""Power"" while an intense battle scene is going on.So beyond all that and other personal gripes I had with the film, I do want to bring focus to the characters. I had no previous knowledge of any of the actors and actresses besides Becky G (Trini/Yellow Ranger) being a musician and me loving RJ Cyler (Billy/Blue Ranger) in the film 'Me, Earl, and the Dying Girl'. RJ Cyler easily stole the show. From the moment he entered the screen, I loved every moment of his screen time... Discount Zac Efron aka Dacre Montgomery (Jason/Red Ranger) was a solid player in the film. I was not entirely thrilled with his role of the leader but I hope to see better from him with the expected coming sequels... Naomi Scott and Ludi Lin (Kimberly/Pink Ranger and Zack/Yellow Ranger) were average for me. I was not a fan of Kimberly's story and Zack was a bit of annoyance but they were nothing perspective altering for me... Lastly, Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa was actually impressive for me. I enjoyed her quirky persona and was actually shocked by the way they presented her at times through almost a horror type way. Very cool for me... Again, overall, solid cast choice and performance for an intro film.-- Oberrated.com --","

"arungeorge13","28 June 2017","The new 'Power Rangers' film has the look and feel of a mixed bag. It tries to cram too much into an origin story which is characterized by unlikable high-schoolers who happen to meet at detention. There is absolutely zero chemistry amongst the Rangers just as Jason the Red Ranger keeps blurting all through the first three quarters of the film. The dialogues are the textbook definition of 'cheesy', while the characters themselves believe they're wise-cracking. Not a good sign if you ask me. PG-13 rating ensures negligible usage of cuss words and gore-free CGI violence. The last act appears like a Transformers rip-off. Ugly-looking stone monsters fighting it out with bots in the town centre in a badly-choreographed setpiece with some absolutely outrageous twists thrown in. Of course, I don't mean to underestimate the current generation of teens but this flick simply caters to a really small audience. None of the characters (barring maybe Billy's) even manage to evoke the slightest bit of interest (or amusement!). A short scene where they all sit down around a fire detailing some of their personal secrets was in fact one of the few redeeming factors. There needed to be plenty more Easter eggs than just the famous Power Rangers theme being played during the climax set-piece. The CGI itself looks lacklustre for a 100 million $ venture. The narrative is so jumbled and the tone literally all over the place for this film to be treated as a solid 'Power Rangers' reboot. Elizabeth Banks (under a truckload of make-up) looks bizarre and seems miscast for the character of Rita Repulsa, whose costumes appear to be unintentionally hilarious.The writing goes haywire from the moment the group discovers the spaceship and encounters Zordon, the previous Red Ranger. More light should have been shed on individual character weaknesses before moving on to bigger things like preparing to become 'Rangers' all of a sudden (just because some entity in a spaceship tells them that they're designated world-protectors!). The training scenes are a mess. Performances aren't exactly stuff to write home about. This film positions itself as harmless popcorn fun and nothing more. Sigh!","

"asifahsankhan","2 June 2017","Whenever Hollywood attempts to reboot a beloved, preexisting property on the big screen, it always feels more or less reconstructed in a way to be more accessible for all kinds of audiences, and less specific than the original incarnation may have ever been. The best thing that can be said about 2017's Power Rangers then - Saban and Lionsgate's new attempt at bringing the iconic title back to life as a large scale blockbuster - is that it doesn't ever feel like it betrays the core values of the Power Rangers franchise.First things first: Elizabeth Banks. She all but guarantees ""Power Rangers"" will not quite be yet another CGI special-effects franchise nostalgia superhero extravaganza. In her characterisation of alien vileness Rita Repulsa, she goes far, far over the tipsiest of tops, showing splendid awareness of how far-beyond-stoop-id the movie is.That's a complicated way of saying Rita has no eyebrows, and acts like people with no eyebrows in movies often do, i.e., a total meanie.Bless Banks for cutting a campy swath through a movie that very much needs it. Otherwise, ""Power Rangers"" is a mess, unsure whether it should be a kitschy throwback romp or ultramodern emo-reboot. A person could pull a groin jerking from tone to tone. I will say the film's visual palette, a convincing blend of CGI and practical effects, is distinctive, ambitious and sometimes impressively weird. It's just too bad such creativity is at the service of this dumb movie. For an early action sequence, director Dean Israelite (""Project Almanac"") employs a swivelling POV camera in the back of a speeding truck; employing this type of virtuoso technique for a ""Power Rangers"" movie is akin to carving SpongeBob SquarePants from a block of Italian marble.The film begins auspiciously, with a subtitle reading ""PLANET EARTH: CENOZOIC ERA,"" and Bryan Cranston grunting impenetrable dialogue from behind heavy alien makeup. I steeled myself for the worst. It gets worse before it gets better: Cut to the modern day (what, no subtitle reading ""65 MILLION YEARS LATER""?), when small-town high- school football star Jason (Dacre Montgomery) admits to milking a cow, although he didn't realise it was actually a bull until he examines its undercarriage, its genitalia photographed in disturbing close-up.So immediately, this ""Power Rangers"" establishes its audience as grown-up kids who played with the toys and watched the television show in the 1990s, not the eight-year-oldies currently trawling the Target aisle for branded laser swords. Notably, it's also rife with scenes of pervasive violence, a criticism frequently levied at the ""Power Rangers"" franchise in its heyday of popularity. But in that sense, it's similar to the recent ""Transformers"" and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movies, which also reconfigured youth-culture franchises into ugly displays of digital Noe-realist carnage. Power Rangers likely won't do much for those who never liked the property in the first place. But for those who grew up with it, or found it through the many different incarnations throughout the years, it provides the kind of passionate, loving reboot that we very rarely see from the studio system nowadays - one that goes deeper into its mythology without ever losing the camp element that made it so much fun in the first place. While it doesn't quite pull off everything it wants to, but it's a fun time at the theatre nonetheless.","

"akilianetc-23277","28 June 2018","As Zordon said, only find those who are worthy and strong. So I think the cast did a great job at portraying that with this modern updated storyline. I remember watching the original TV series when it first debut as I was just a kid then. I felt like the chemistry between all of them could have been a little more natural but in the end it's about being a team and only 2 hours doesn't do so much justice to that. I really hope to see what they do with the sequel.","

"siderite","10 August 2020","I have not grown up with the Power Rangers and so I don't have any melancholy towards the story or the characters. I can only imagine it was a children's action series or something. I expected the script to be idiotic, but I also hoped for something fun. There was nothing fun, inspiring or funny about the whole thing. In fact, it was totally depressing. I almost empathized with the psychotic villain because everything else was so boring, bland or nonsensical.Watching a Hollywood movie based on superheros that sucks was not unexpected. Using actors like Dacre Montgomery, who did a good job in Stranger Things, for a character jumping around in pointless stunts while having no shred of personality was a crime, though. Putting Elizabeth Banks in the role of the villain opened up so many different potential doors; they closed and locked them all with a character so unidimensional that it hurt. She did a good job with it, too, perhaps just to spite them. And finally, Bryan Cranston, Mr Breaking Bad himself, the ranger (ironically) who sacrificed himself to end the Shadow War... as a face in a wall acting like a sporting couch.This film deserves no praise, not even anger, just pity and oblivion.","

"MinistryofDoom","29 June 2017","The Jock, the Nerd, the Outcast, the New Girl, the Edgy Loner....stuck in detention hell for the rest of the year, forced to put up with each other and learn that they each are more than their stereotype, as the become more self-confident and joint together to become (cue fanfare)...THE POWER RANGERS. This film goes into great detail explaining each of the main characters and their person struggles, mostly about being misunderstood by their parents or society. However,....they coincidentally happen to be at the same location at the very same time on the very same day to discover that they were chosen to be the Power Rangers. How convenient.This film is 3/4th teen angst drama and 1/4th super hero action. While it goes to great lengths to explain each character's backstory, when the action superhero portion of the film starts, it fails to feel the urgency of the conflict that they are made to resolve. It doesn't explain who the villains are or where they came from or who the Power Rangers' mentor is for that matter. The most that we're given is a few blurbs here and there. The actual costumed Power Rangers in all their colorful glory do not even show up until very late in the film.In this regard, it feels like the Director isn't sure if his aim was to create a standalone superhero action film or a two hour segue into an inevitable Power Rangers sequel. While most of the performances are OK, Brian Cranston as the voice of Zordon and Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa stand out. Banks in particular is every bit as crazy and demented as you'd expect Rita Repulsa to be. To be honest, I was skeptical when I heard that she was up for the role. The only performances I've seen of hers were in Judd Apatow- style comedies but rest assured than in Power Rangers, she really delivers.For those in doubt, this film definitely takes it's cues from the campy TV show of the 90s. There's a big emphasis on ""morphin' time"" and certain characters and references taken directly from the show indicate that the writers and director were definitely trying to woo the dedicated fans of this brand.In the end, it's not a bad movie. It just seems a little confused about what it wants to be and that confusion ultimately hurts this reboot.","

"Bosco-HK","26 March 2017","I grew up watching Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers! Ever since the several ""movie versions"", I was waiting for this reboot as a movie from the Original 1993 TV Series. If I remembered correctly, this reboot was even ""slightly"" delayed. This review contains spoilers, kindly continue at your own discretion. ---Pros:I appreciated the portrayal of ethnicity (as many as possible), gender, (and even included orientation in the essence of the characters).Starring Dacre Montgomery as Jason/Red, Naomi Scott as Kimberly/Pink, Becky G. as Trini/Yellow, RJ Cyler as Billy/Blue, and Ludi Lin as Zack/Black. From one end of the world to the other, covering several different continents.I most enjoyed is Naomi Scott. Even as Pink, I felt like she played ""the backbone"" of the team especially during the handling of the Zords. Despite as much as having some cultural diversity, with the actors and actresses representing, the attempt to portray ""physique"" was probably too tough when comparing to what I remember from the Original 1993-96 TV Series.The next favorite of all the characters, is Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks).What I mean by ""physique"" is not just trying to match ""body type"" to be just like the Original 1993 series. Over the course of training, we can see that Kimberly (Naomi Scott) showed more ""artistry"" and ""put effort in training"" from her ""cool tough shoulder-to-headshot"" which I really liked. I think it is due to Kimberly, bringing out her gymnastic background to show signs of physique or an all-around athlete. And even Trini was the next quick learner even though she was the one to show her speed in climbing from the side effects (a reference to Sabretooth), and then Kimberly caught up and even beat Zack to the top. Most likely intentional that the ladies were presented to be better than the guys (yet to see their stories for physique), which gets my thumbs up!This is not a con of the movie but the ability to do that ""huge leap"" was a little bit awkward but a reference to ""Superman/Hulk/Spiderman/etc""? I must say though, portraying the two ladies (both Trini and Kimberly) to be awesome at their landing. I laughed at the three guys who had their ""trouble"" with their ""leap"".I like how though that ""the battle phases"" were short sticking true that good vs evil, it is always ""practically easy for the good"" to win. However, as far as ""origins"" or ""starting from fresh"", I think the battle phases could be longer or put more difficulty. We cannot forget about cameos! Amy Jo Johnson (Kimberly/Pink) and Jason David Frank (Tommy/Green/White, or later Red and ""Professor"" at one point in each respective TV series).On the other side, Elizabeth Banks as Rita, indeed quite marvelous. Of course, her tag line ""Make My Monster Grow"" was included in an okay fashion but I guess the original was just an exaggeration and ""perhaps the final decision"" was just to go with ""a literal aspect?""---Cons:I feel like the cons in any review should first be reviewed based on the limitations of movie length. By that, movies have been gradually reduced in duration, now almost all of them vary between 1 hour 20 minutes and 2 hour 20 minutes, or otherwise taken to ""Part 2"" rather than ""sequel"".Before I really go ""in somewhat order of occurrence"", I guess they tried to do it like you know ""when after several episodes you don't really need to see the entire Megazord transformation"", this 2017 reboot did that for the ""Go Go Power Rangers..."" song. I was actually very happy that they brought it in but then decided to use ""a technique in TV Series"" rather than playing the entire thing out and jump ""almost straight into action"" which is another film technique. Still, I would have preferred to have heard the entirety of the song, since they obviously took out the ""cheesy Morphin'"" with the ""Morphers"" or ""some sort of hand-held equipment to morph"". Another very notable downfall was ""using techniques"" to save a life. I think I don't have to say much more about that. This is before going back to HQ.What I felt was ""the meeting of characters was too rushed at the ""Saturday detention"". Detention, I believe it is a reference to ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985), by all means not even close, I found ""The Slap"", extremely funny, clearly girly for an outstanding quarterback (QB).I understand that each character was showcased in a rather stereotypical manner from the beginning, I still think we can have more character focus. Perhaps, kept for sequels to tie in ""friendship"" or ""history of connection"" for future characters who will become Rangers or ""fit for being a Ranger because they were, for example, training partners or like a father's friend's son or like someone who long disappeared or that they left behind after ""moving"".Back to the battle phases, perhaps length-limiting though unsure, ""the discovery of combining into the Megazord"" was ""way too rushed"" just as they are about to lose. And then that ""backdrop suplex?"", not a ""special move"" at all but simply from ""training"", as ""the surprise factor"" over an opponent now wielding a long-reach weapon. Anyway, for better or worse, all the ""cheesy"" stuff made it ""rather adolescent"" resulting to a ""degrading effect"" in terms of ""what is known with a reboot"". From ""The Slap at Detention"", to ""Trini's water bottle"", to at the very end where Rita exclaimed ""How?!"" was extra comical, bringing back the exaggeration lost in ""Make My Monster Grow"", perhaps ""The Second Slap"" turned out to reference ""why Rita and Gang were to be at the Moon Palace""?I think it is good to stop here, to avoid seeming as though I am a 110%- perfect writer or director. I hope some of you may find the above long- windedness ""up to standard"".","

"andrewcreer","24 March 2017","Power Rangers struggles for two major reasons: The movie takes too long to find its feet, and it tries a little too hard to include embarrassing levels of teenage angst. It is understandable that after being renewed for FIVE sequels - that some background set-up is required, and trying to establish character background would be important (although this film falls far short of making the characters have any emotional pull).When the movie finally gets rolling - that is when fans of the franchise can sit back, and really enjoy the show. For those who are seeing this movie as long-time fans of the Rangers - get ready for the nostalgia trip of your life. As a fan of the series, I left this movie satisfied and smiling after the final forty five minutes of pure enjoyment. If you are willing to look passed some of the very apparent flaws of this film, it is overall a very enjoyable experience.","

Given the current overload of various CGI heavy productions, I doupt this has any merit for a newcommer, yet the movie doesn't really lean into nostalgia, fun or CHEESE to make it fun for the now adult audience. My rating might be harsh, as there is nothing really offensive about the movie but it is a waste of your time. It has nothing to offer at all and I have no idea who was it made for?","

"burningphoenix36","29 July 2017","What I loved about this movie was how it was not an exact replica of the original pilot just as a cheap cash grab, it had a new story that was completely different from the original. It had many scenes to bring nostalgia while still doing what a reboot should do, reboot it in a completely different way. The interesting and heavy/dark take on it made it perfect for teenagers today. It's definitely not for kids, and adults who loved the original series will not like this movie because it is nothing like the original, and is oversexualized and too heavy for the fun loving original story. However it's not for that demographic either. The demographic this story is speaking to and meant for is middle schoolers and high schoolers who watched the show when they were kids, such as myself. The topics and struggles every characters goes through are true to the struggles of everyday teens in this day and age. So saying this movie ruins the original or isn't kid friendly, it's kind of a no brainer, because it's telling a new more relevant story for teens who struggle with these issues all the time. This is why I loved it and felt this movie spoke to me. I feel this movie is a must watch for those who are in their teenage years. Of course the movie had flaws as all movies do but this movie is a great reboot for the next generation.","

"mhorg2018","12 January 2018","Take a huge budget. Add in a cast of unremarkable, paint by numbers actors (I use that lightly, although Dacre was way better in Stranger things 2), a dialed in script (How the hell did they get Bryan Cranston to be in this? Guess he needed some extra dough). As usual in this kind of crummy movie, make the villain (Elisabeth Banks steals every scene she's in) the most memorable character and end it with a hoped for sequel that, due this one falling with a resounding thud, will likely never get made. The end.","

"peterfbrand","31 July 2020","I do not know why this movie has been rated so low!!! It's The Power Rangers! It's going to be a little cheesy. I loved how it includes all the various ethnicities and the character who's ""on the spectrum"" my son loved that and it fits really well.
A great feel good movie, great acting, great specials effects, great story line, i loved the extra cheese towards the end with the ""Go-Go Power Rangers bit""
I really believe most of the bad ratings for this movie were from people who have no idea what The Power Rangers was.
Brilliant movie. I HOPE they make a sequel. The lead reminds me of a young Zack Efron.
Thumbs up from me.","

"p-jonsson","31 May 2017","Buying this movie was of course pretty much a request from my kids although I have to confess that I, as a Science Fiction geek, was at least a tiny bit interested in seeing what they had managed to cook together on a big budget. For the record I find the television show absolutely awful. Therefore I am quite surprised that I found the movie to be not exactly good but at least watchable.Make no mistake, it is indeed a silly and simple plot, teenage wet dream, stupid and illogical kind of story that you would expect. However, it was actually mildly fun to watch. Most of my enjoyment came from the special effects and action sequences of course. The dialog and behavior of the teenage heroes were as stereotyped and generally awful as one would expect.This of course means that the first half of the movie is less interesting than the second half when the action picks up. Actually, although there are some fun moments during ""training"", I felt this entire idea of them not being able to use their powers before they had gotten into the right ""mental state"" to prove that they were actually Power Rangers was just a rubbish one.Once things started to pick up speed it became more interesting. The different means of transport of the Power Rangers was absolutely silly but still great fun to watch.Well, I really do not have that much more to say. The last parts of the movie was one big special effects feast with a few comic elements in it, most of them rather  teenage. Fun to watch for a science fiction geek like me.So, the verdict? Was it a fun movie to watch? Yeah, it was pretty okay. Was it a good movie? Well, that is probably stretching it.","

"blueclementinex","26 March 2017","so, i just watched power rangers movie, and i say that all my expectations are fulfilled. to start it off, as a kid i love power rangers, and i almost watched every episodes of it. as a teenager, however i love to make fun of how campy and ridiculous it is, and when i first heard of this movie, my expectations are pretty much low. i mean, come on, just based on the source material which is a very dull (yet funny in a way) it's not like i'm walking to the movie expecting a cinematic masterpiece. first of all, i'm just going to say that, yes, the CGI is no better than what you've seen in the trailer. it's that stupid, but as in what the movie is targeted (which are for the younger audiences ) it's pretty forgivable. although i'm not that sure because sometimes the scenes are way too creepy for the younger audiences, and some of the jokes are pretty mature as well. but it's not the main issue though, because i think it's trying to show that the movie is trying to entertain everybody (which often fails, though).but one of my main issue with this movie is the performances. i'm serious, it's so bad that it becomes an entertainment. there's this particular scene that supposed to be sad and emotional yet somehow left me laughing because the actors literally show no expression to show so but only teary eyes. some of the actors's line delivery are so forced that it came out very funny. Elizabeth banks is so bad that it's embarrassing to watch her. and this bad acting doesn't stop there, it is completed with bad script. i mean, sure i guess you want to make a script that is easy to understand, but it doesn't mean that it has to be that dumb. i mean, seriously, the combination of these two disastrous elements somehow remind of SUICIDE SQUAD. at first, i'm not that sure then there's this scene where they talked about their feelings and their stories but it's so forced, unrealistic, bland, and bad-performed, that suddenly remind me of that bar scene in suicide squad- where every character tries to talk their insecurities and stories to developed the characters but failed, and it happened in this movie, but worse because the actors are way worse than suicide squad. but, rather than trashing this movie, i would like to say a few good things about it, like the score and soundtrack . i mean i'm not saying it's a good score (trust me, in the battle scene where the climax of the movie happened, the music plays the power rangers theme song for a second, cut to a new shot, a second or so after the new shot they played a tense music all of the sudden (which not just bad-placed but very hilarious) , but i really appreciate that the score and soundtrack's shows some similarities with what the show's score and soundtrack. because at some scene, it felt pretty nostalgic to the show. the fight scene is also very ridiculous, but it's ridiculous in a way that we can appreciate it, especially the fans of the shows because believe me, if you watch this movie and thought the fight scenes are dumb, you clearly haven't watch the show's fight scenes. overall, i really recommend you to watch this movie if you're just looking for a popcorn fun, blockbuster movie but don't expect anything bigger than what it's already appears to be.6/10","

"DarkVulcan29","1 April 2017","Batman, Superman, and Spider Man all got rebooted, now it's time for the power rangers, some remember the 90's Saturday morning kids show, and the other Rangers shows that followed. Now the Power Rangers are here in 2017.It's not silly and campy like the original series, this film plays itself very seriously, I mean there is humor but not like the original series. The characters play there parts well and put there own spin on it. Plays like The Breakfast Club with superpowers,puts a little realism in there performances. Elizabeth banks is great has Rita Repulsa, puts a terrifying spin on it. Bryan Cranston is also good has Zordon, playing a old mentor helping the hero's destiny. Effects are good, and action scenes are incredible also.","

"ayoreinf","27 March 2017","Being all grown up when the original hit the TV screens, it soon became one of my silliest guilty pleasures. I did like Amy Jo Johnson, who probably launched her career with the series, but she was the single redeeming element in a real stupid series. No real characters, so obviously no real character growth, stupid methodical breaks for morphing time at every stage of morphing they went through, and the lame lame jokes with Bulk and Skull. Still I had to see what they made with the original, so I went to see it on the big screen.This is so much better in comparison with the original I should have rated it off the chart. But even as stand alone movie, it's not a bad one. To begin with we get real characters here, and they do go through some real character growth. It does include some cheesy moments, but as rule the actors are all doing their job well, some even better than well. That is R.J. Cyler and Becky G and Naomi Scott. So the Bulk and Skull jokes are gone, replaced by some real live bullying. The detention room does feel a bit like a recycling of The Breakfast Club, but it's a real minor issue. Rita Repulsa is a real villain here. - Elizabeth Banks is really super in this role, I wish they gave her more screen time.So this is my bottom line. It's definitely a decent fantasy comics action movie, just please don't call it sci-fi, simply have fun watching it.","

"drawlife","24 March 2017","When I heard this movie was being made, I was optimistic and cautious. While following the hype train, I was happy to see that the film was being taken seriously. The only aspect I really disliked from all the announcements that were being made were the Power Ranger outfits themselves. Aside from that, everything else was pretty much on point. Power Rangers isn't the disaster I was hoping it wasn't going to be. For the original fans out there, this movie just was not going to work with that campy tone similar to the television series. It worked for what it was as a television show for children such as myself back in the day. That just wasn't going to translate well on the big screen, lets not kid ourselves. Plus the previous Power Ranger films that came out in the 90's weren't met with acclaim or did big numbers at the box office. The film's main problem is that it has an identity crisis, trying to be serious teen drama to an adventure filled sci-fi action film. Moments work here and there, sporadically. RJ Cyler is the bright spot as Billy the Blue Ranger. He's the only one that really gives the group of teens a lot flare, and his autistic side is portrayed with respect. Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, Ludi Lin, and Becky G are all given something to do. Montgomery's Jason is the once promising athlete turned screw-up and the team's leader. He almost finds redemption in the film given his responsibilities as the Red Ranger. Scott's Kimberly finds a new home when she's kicked out of her own click in school. Lin's Zack is an outcast who acts tough, but that's just to hide his fears and insecurities. Becky G's Trini is also an outcast loner who comes to accept herself, her coming out is handled with care and treated with respect like Billy's autism. The cast actually is not too bad either and for the most part deliver with their performances. The film tries to give them all layers and it can be engaging, even if it is a Breakfast Club ripoff.Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader are great. Even as a child, I've hated Alpha-5 since the original show premiered and here he's a little less annoying thanks to Hader's performance. Cranston's Zordon has more to do that tell the Rangers who their up against. He's got personality and also has ulterior motives. The weak link is Elizabeth Banks as Rita. She looks like she's having fun and cutting it loose to portray her, but she doesn't do much outside of conquering the world like all typical villains do. We don't really learn anything about her and why she's doing what she's doing. More screen time to develop her would have been nice. At best the film plays out like an episode of any DC/Marvel superhero show on the CW or abc. The origin story is exactly what anyone would expect in an origin story. It can be tiring to sit through as the familiar tropes are extremely apparent and can get boring from time to time. Once it goes into high gear it gets fun. This is where the identity crisis also comes in play as it becomes a CGI, over the top action feast for 15-20 minutes. Despite it being fun to watch, it really never felt completely earned, the story never really positioned itself to actually feel earned. Also bare in mind there is a lot of Krispy Kreme promotion in the film. I've never seen a movie put that much promotion and devotion at all to any product. Being a former Power Ranger die-hard, I cannot watch a single frame of any Power Ranger episodes at all, they're all so terrible, but the nostalgia always stays. For a reimagining/homage it's a step towards the right direction. But it's also a jumbled mess. Should there be a sequel, I would hope it figures out what it wants to be. Also redesign the damn outfits they're an eyesore. Less is more. All in all I'm happy that the filmmakers took the property seriously and I'm open to see what's next. 6.8/10","

"Giacomo_De_Bello","7 April 2017","When five teenagers get lost and find themselves in the midst of a gold mine they discover something special: five colored coins in the middle of the rocks. When they start experiencing out of the ordinary events they come back together and figure out that there might be something special to what has happened to them.Dean Israelite clearly demonstrates a passion for this project and I must admit that how the whole thing came together with Lionsgate behind made me actually curious to check out this update, I was somewhat intrigued by the voice and style they were putting behind the film and I, in a way, was right to do so: the first 50 minutes of the film gave me something special, it is sad that they had to be lessened by another hour of complete tonal shift.When I say I was into this film for the fist half or so I mean it literally. This film really surprised and got to me up until then, Israelite was doing some really solid directing, the action scenes were visceral and done in one shot, almost all of the fluff was absent and it left space for some solid and effective character development. I remember having a moment in the theater where I thought that this was actually very solid writing: there were different thrusts being developed efficiently and the screenplay was carrying out smart character touches.The editing was sporadically jarring, but the use of the camera was definitely making up for it: the first five shots of this film have two long takes of action that were genuinely stunning and absorbing. The characters come together in an organic way, defying genre clichés and making for a group of quirky individuals that have an identity and a place with one another, they are all outlined with personal characteristics and become instantly recognizable.Unfortunately after the very inspiring first half there is not much to add here. It seems like they just forgot what movie they were making in the second half. The characters loose grit by being put on a journey that isn't interesting and does not develop them. Tonally the film enters a big shift and starts going for fluff out of nowhere. Israelite seems to forget how to direct interesting action and the whole last act is a disaster of fast paced cutting, not understanding what is going on and overall total loss of affection for anyone involved.It is sad that a film that started out with such a bang in action and character becomes a totally different one by the end and leaves me with so little to add. There is no silver lining, it's just a very disappointing first half that completely undoes what the first one did, it changes in every aspect from the characters and the the tone to the how the action is shot and the CGI is used making ""Power Rangers"" all in all an average effort with a very promising start.","

"walkingwithprimeval","1 July 2021","When I first heard that a new Power Rangers film adaptation was going to get made with a more lavished and sophisticated Hollywood makeover, I thought to myself; ""Seriously? You've got to be kidding me."" When I eventually saw the first teaser trailer, I wasn't the least bit excited for its release. I kept thinking to myself; ""You know? This doesn't look like Power Rangers, at all. Looks way more like Josh Trank's Chronicle than anything else."" When the movie first came out and I got around to seeing it with some pretty low-expectations, it still managed to be a major let down and I was disappointed (but it's been several years since then and I've gotten over it). Now that some time has passed after all these years, I've decided to go back and try to rewatch it over again in an attempt to better evaluate my thoughts since I'm able to properly articulate my real honest feelings on the movie as a whole and see whether or not my opinions on it have changed at all (so it's all fresh in my mind, once more). The film as a whole is filled with so many contrivances that none of its story beats flow together naturally and the humour doesn't always land for me, either (except for Bill Hager's Alpha 5, who did give me a good chuckle from time to time).At times, I felt like I was watching a coming-of-age teen movie and not Power Rangers, and I admired those aspects of the film. But it has such an incredibly jarring tonal shift halfway through, acting like a little small-scale quirky indie drama about a dysfunctional group of social outcasts one minute, and then going all-out into full-on tentpole summer blockbuster mode with the cheesy sci-if concept of intergalactic super-beings who battle against evil forces by controlling big robot dinosaurs (you see the clashing of tones, here?). It's almost like the filmmakers didn't really know how to handle, or even approach, this sort of crazy-but-cool material and so they decided to try this awkward mishmash of different genre elements that don't quite fit. Moments of the journey these loner high-school youths go on can be mildly compelling, like with the campfire scene that happens at the midway point. Each one of them is shown discussing their own personal turmoil that they have to overcome and watching the emotionally-vulnerable ""teenagers with attitude"" open up to one another about the everyday adolescent problems of growing into maturity is admittedly kind of charming, as is seeing them all unite together in the third act (and their whole team-dynamic was also fairly well-developed).Nowadays, I often find myself bored senseless by most modern large-scale movies I see as they're too reliant on CGI-heavy sequences (example; fully CGI characters fighting in a completely CGI environment, which was all the elaborate creation of a VFX team rendering their CGI work on hundreds of computer screens). After a while, it just leaves my brain feeling numb from all the big action set-pieces and lengthy scenes of mindless destruction, which SHOULD be epic and NOT dull (I'm tired of always staring at a longwinded video game cutscene). Marvel Studios are the only ones who've managed to keep the utilisation of photorealistic-CGI visual-effects feeling fresh due mainly in part to them hiring the same VFX companies over and over again, so they're pretty much pros at this point in time and know what they're doing when it comes to seamlessly compositing every digitally-created background shot together in the same scene (not to mention, they have way more money put into their mega-budgets along with the extra time and resources to properly render everything out).And by the way, whatever happened to the colour-palette's bright vibrancy that the Power Rangers franchise has always been predominantly known for? (not to mention, where've all the exciting flashy sparks gone?). After Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, suddenly everyone wanted to get in on the whole ""making superhero films all dark and serious"" craze (and that includes having muted colours). Reimagining the fun-loving upbeat tone of the original colourful source material isn't clever writing, it's just copying what everybody else is doing and reinventing the playful tongue-in-cheek brand for edgy teens and cynical adults to enjoy (much like with the travesty of Michael Bay's Transformers). There's nothing inherently wrong with this practice of business model per say, but there's a limit to how far you're able to ground something like this in total realism (I mean, seriously now). I'll say this in the film's defence, at least it's darkened aesthetic isn't as ugly for my eyes to look at as let's say the murky cinematography of Zack Snyder's movies are (I've just never enjoyed the man's ""artistic vision"").Getting into Power Rangers fan-mode for just a bit; I have very mixed feelings on the Rangers' Zords. On one hand, I like the fact that these powerful alien fighting machines actually appear to be of a somewhat techno-organic nature. But on the other hand, some of the robots are designed in such a bizarre way that it makes them look kind of silly. I mean, the T-Rex, Pterodactyl and Sabretooth all look fine to me (as far as ""Bayformer"" Dinobots go). But what's up with the Triceratops and Mastodon having additional pairs of legs, huh? (I got to say, it's a downright weird stylistic choice to do that). The idea of these colossal assault vehicles taking on the giant molten Goldar monster in their individual metallic beast forms first is neat, but I wasn't too thrilled with the way in which they executed that whole half of the end battle. And the entire Megazord transformation sequence for the final climactic one-on-one brawl could've been shown in much greater detail than it was, being mostly obscured by fiery digital-effects.Rita Repulsa's actress was practically chewing the scenery and hamming it all the way up with her villainess performance, tipping over the acting scale and pushing the dial far past 10 (Elizabeth Banks appears to be the only cast member who's actually having a blast in their role). Bryan Cranston returning to the franchise in a more prominent capacity as wise mentor Zordon was respectable fan-service and an honourable tribute, it seems. And the famous original ""Go Go"" theme song was also a nice inclusion, too (that was a real treat to hear). But with all that Power Rangers nostalgia put aside, is it a good movie on its own for non-fans to watch? Well, now... I'm going to say no, not really (it isn't). The general moviegoing public may find it to be a stale cliched superhero film, about the ancient search for a mystical artefact that's existed since before time began, and will most likely want to opt out in favour of waiting for the next Marvel or DC movie to come along. And the actual diehard purists won't like many of the changes it makes to the long-running series' lore and mythos. And so after numerous compromises by the clueless filmmakers (and possibly the meddling studios, as well), there might not be that much of an incentive left for people to actually WANT to watch this and before you know it, you end up with an unsatisfactory subpar movie that's made to please no one (a lose-lose situation for all parties involved).","

"andrebonavita","21 November 2017","I saw this movie without expectation, only waiting a film better than the one made in 1995. The first half-part of the movie is really good, mainly with the rereading of the classical Saban's characters. The 360° rotation camera used in one scene was great. This first part remember me the 2012's movie ""Chronicle"" where young discover their powers. The soundtrack works nicely to introduce the characters and along the movie. Contrasting with the 1/3 part, from 2/3 to the end the director Bryan Spicer gave to us only a median movie with clichés used in TV series an 1995 movie but with extra visual effects. So the great begging was lost and a this median released movie.I like Bryan Cranston as Zordon but as I said before, the director loose his hand at 2/3 part to the end so Cranston could be substituted by anyone with no difference.I think the producers loose a chance to create a bigger cinema franchise and the Pacific Rim.Pros: some fan service and nice soundtrack Cons: median screenplay and chance to produce a better movie.","

So you can understand my disappointment when I finally went to the movie I've been dying to see since I saw the trailer like 3 months ago and it was absolute garbage! This movie was beyond corny and with an extremely unorganized plot. I found all of the Power Ranger actors/actresses to be horrible at acting and shouldn't quit there Day jobs. I found the whole movie just really bad and that was extremely disappointing to me. I really was hoping to be blown away and that definitely did not happen... The only reason I even gave this movie a 4 was just because the cinematography was good and the only thing I liked. All in all I couldn't help roll my eyes and wait for it to end.

It also had really deep character moments and so much amazing character growth. The representation of both the autistic spectrum and the LGBTQ spectrum was beautiful and suited the rangers great. The Rangers have always been diverse and now it's in more than just race. The costumes were amazing and the zords were even cooler. If I had to gripe about anything it's the way the rangers were inside the megazord but I can live with that no problem. Seeing what they did with Rita was pure gold and the two cameos in this film was fan service at its best. They felt like power rangers and the way the movie made it fit in with the times was perfect. I want to go back for more of this movie, can't wait for the sequel!","

"micamecham","12 August 2017","I thought it was pretty good. Let's be real, Power Rangers was impossibly cheesy and hard to watch in its original form. So you can't expect this to be Oscar worthy. I liked the background. Loved the Billy character and inclusion of someone on the spectrum. I thought Elizabeth Banks, who I LOVE, wasn't as awesome in this as she was in say her Effie Trinket performance, but she was no more cheesy than the original character in this role from the original movies. I do think it took a little long to get to the actual morphing suit wearing part. Additionally, I think for a kid movie, it could have done without the cursing. You have to know kids are going to watch it. Other than that, it was entertaining enough to watch with family on a Saturday night. My kids liked it. Overall, it was entertaining in a ""hey let's watch a movie that is light in thought and entertaining in a predictable but still pretty good for a laid back night"" kind of way.","

"Troy_Campbell","24 March 2017","After sitting through this overlong cinematic adventure for the titular band of colourful warriors, it's not completely clear if this was made for the 30-somethings who grew up with the cheesy show or the current generation of pre-teens. Similar in tone and presentation to Michael Bay's Transformers franchise, this big screen adaptation has a healthy dose of teenage angst (and awkwardness), whirling camera-work and rapid-fire editing, suggesting the new crop of kids are the target audience. On the other hand there's a tongue-in-cheek campiness that is clearly meant to tug on the nostalgia strings; the goofily choreographed fights, the insanely hammy villain and the on-the-nose metaphors are all handed over from show to movie. It's hard to see how either demographic is going to walk away wholly satisfied though. A bloated runtime and a lack of action will surely lead to boredom for the young'uns, and the ludicrously long wait to actually see the Power Rangers in full getup could annoy the fans from way back. Waiting until approximately 90 minutes in before the new batch of heroes even suit up, the climax is a CGI flurry of underwhelming baddies, nonsensical action beats and plot contrivances so outlandish they make Vin Diesel films seem as clever as Inception. There's no doubting the noble intentions of this modern update, and Elizabeth Banks is a blast as Rita Repulsa, however this incarnation of Power Rangers fails to quicken the pulse.","

"casscamolas","27 March 2017","As good as you thought it would be! I think the most impressive part of this film is how in parts in it is very dark while keeping the same nostalgic feel of the original, Elisabeth Banks reimagine's Rita repulsa to be a violent and cold blooded villain while the rangers themselves throw themselves at being heroes while dealing with everyday problems that teenagers have growing up. Go and watch this film, easily one of the best of 2017 and one that is certainly more for adults who were kids 20 years ago when the ranger arrived!","

I knew going into this when we went to the movies to see it that this wasn't going to be what it was, it's a new year and a new time but I was still really excited about this movie. I loved this movie! I actually bought it today and am re-watching it as I type this. It is what I loved yet something new, it still makes me want to be the pink ranger and it's something me and my husband both love and can enjoy together as adults in a different yet similar way as we enjoyed in our youth! I won't spoil anything and I won't keep blabbing - you'll decide on your own what you love or hate but as a power rangers lover, as a nostalgic adult - I swear I love it!","

"Verdugo85","16 June 2017","Anyone that was born in 1984, 1985 and 1986 that grew up watching ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" TV series on FOX 5 after school in the 90s should definitely avoid this crap. My siblings and I grew up with Power Rangers, we were so hooked up on them to the point that our parents found it to be a serious issue but Power Rangers was a great childhood experience.This reboot movie is long, boring and not nostalgic. OK, I get that they were doing a ""re-imagine"" version of the kids show but it was poorly executed and the movie is dark and serious?? Gtfo with that sht! The characters: Jason is a reckless loser, Kimberly is a secret btch, Zack is...I don't even know, I'll give Billy a pass since he's autistic, Trini is a troubled, angry, lesbian/bisexual punk, *sigh* whatever and Zordon is a DICK! These characters are uninspiring. The actors had no chemistry, they were bland, boring and ungathered. The movie spent most of the time introducing the characters who/what they are and then in the last 30 minutes of the film for their first battle as the Power Rangers everything is rushed.""Oh but this is an origin film"" I Don't CARE!! Guardians of the Galaxy was also an origin film for the team and they were written properly.Power Rangers suit looked cool but the Zords? The only zords I noticed was Jason's and Kim's but what are Zack, Billy and Trini zords suppose to be? And the zords assembled out of nowhere with the Megazord looking like Optimus Prime and the CGI sucked.The putties looked like ""The Thing"" from that crappy reboot Fantastic Four 2015 film, Goldar looked like a walking golden liquid T-1000. Rita Repulsa was fine, she was an evil btch but she doesn't save this film..P.S. Cameos of Jason David Frank (Tommy Oliver) and Amy Jo Johnson (Kimberly Hart) brought back great childhood memories that it made me forget this movie.","

"MarioSync","3 April 2017","I watched Power Ranger when I was young, and it feels like it was yesterday I saw those dino zord become the Megazord. When I bought the ticket for this movie at first I was quite skeptical since I am wandering how is the writer going to evolve the story about a bunch of teenager getting together and become something else, something bigger than themselves, but I am really happy and glad that my skepticism is not founded. I really like that the movie brings humanity part as well, friendship, trust, the fear of finding something out of this world, and the pace of the story also enough in this time frame. The actors and actress are also good, good casting guys!!! haven't seen Naomi Scott since Terra Nova, and everyone manage to gel the character together well, great job in playing each of your character as well. Hopefully there is a sequel for this, look forward to it.","

"EthanBJones_03","21 May 2017","Power Rangers(2017) was directed by Dean Israelite and stars Dacre Montgommery, Elizabteth Banks, Krispy Kreme Donuts and RJ Cyler. Five ordinary teens must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove - and the world - is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so, they will have to overcome their real-life issues and before it's too late, band together as the Power Rangers.I won't claim to be a Krisp... Power Rangers expert but what I will say is that this movie blows. I mean the acting was competent and it was well shot but I mean it's got no substance and too little Krispy Kreme Donuts. If you are a long time fan of Power Rangers, you may very well like this movie. I have watched Power Rangers but I know enough about it to make an educated review but I just cannot say this movie is even remotely good. The story is bad. 'Nuff said.All of the actual 'Power Rangers' did good performances(much to my surprise) and thoroughly impressed. Despite this we all know that Krispy Kreme Donuts were the best actors in this movie. I mean they are chameleons. They didn't even need to be on screen for that long and they stole the show. They blended into the background like a dog blends into the road(If this offends you then I'm sorry but I actually don't care). Elizabeth Banks was awfully cheesy as Rita Repulsa and really didn't fit with the tone of the movie. Rita Repulsa was an extremely weak villain and was just plain boring.Technically, this movie is fine. It's a well shot movie and the way they blend Krispy Kreme Donuts into the background was pure artistic genius. The effects were really unbelievably but ultimately looked pretty cool and the costume design was also pretty decent.This movie's main two areas of focus are the action and comedy. It provides good action which is childish fun for the eyes but lacks any good comedy or real jokes. If you proof of that then keep in mind the first joke of the movie is about 'violating' a cow to be 'polite'. In conclusion, I imagine true fans of Power Rangers will enjoy this movie but aside from that I don't see this movie getting much critical praise and I don't really recommend it.4/10","

"banditgeneral4","9 July 2018","I've read several reviews and see people complain about how this film is nothing like the original Power Rangers. That's a good tjing.Every version of the Power Rangers is different than the last. That's what makes it unuque. I'm a child of the mud 80s and early 90s. I was 9 when the original show aired. I couldn't wait to get home from school and see the adventures of the Rangers. I would rent episodes on video every week with my allowance. The action could've been better and the plot a little more thought out but overall it's a film worth seeing. It's far different from any of the other shows or movies and that's what's great about it. It also broke all the rules. The smart kid is now African American and not the ""black"" ranger and the black ranger is now Asian American.If folks don't like the movie they are certainly entitled to their opinions but as for this reviewer I would definitely watch it again and it's going in my video collection.","

"MisterFantastical","22 March 2017","I was a fan of the show in the nineties; I found it extremely entertaining because of its simplicity and goofiness. I enjoyed the 1995 film for the same reasons, and the likability of the cast. So, I wanted this movie to, at least, be entertaining. It was not. The characters were bland, uninteresting, and unlikable. The costumes, so to speak, looking terrible, and exactly what you'd expect from people attempting to update a campy 90's show. There wasn't a single character to whom people could relate in the whole movie. If anything, the experience was exhausting and infuriating. Picture the Transformers movie with WORSE effects and even less likable characters. Do yourself a favor; do no go see this bland, useless nonsense.","

"pokedom","29 July 2017","Let me start off by saying: I have never, ever, been a Power Rangers fan. Never. Not even as a little kid. It just seemed dumb. So here's this movie trying to cash in on the still popular series. It was never going to be fantastic, but by God it could try. And... I burst out laughing at least 5 times. On complete accident, I should note.I should probably skip talking about every problem before the last act and go directly into talking about the ""final battle"". I use quotes because it's not a battle, it's a product placement. The most shameless and saddening product placement I've ever seen. And I thought Guardians of the Galaxy 2's Dairy Queen product placement bugged me! Anyways, the first 2/3rds of the movie are just training and character development. Which would be fine if it was handled well, but its not. The ""mentor"" character (wall) tells them the world is going to end in 14 days. 14 days and a 5 minute training montage with terrible music later and they haven't learned a thing. So I'll just skip it.The ""final battle"" starts with the blue ranger dying... only to come back to life 5 minutes later. Pretty pointless, but he did tell the main bad girl where the all powerful crystal of life giving energy was, so he had it coming.So at this point no one is asking where this crystal is. I can tell you... you are not ready. It's not at the heart of the town (STORYBROOKE OHMAHGAHD), it's not under the house of a ranger.It is... underneath a goddamn Krispy Kreme.I gave up on the film after this. I was willing to look past the awkward dialogue and acting before and accept this as a nostalgia pander to a crowd I was not in. But this right here got me bursting with laughter. And the final battle is just the power rangers in dino- bots defending a Krispy Kreme. They say it multiple times too, ""We have to protect the Krispy Kreme!"" The main bad girl looks at a cup with the Kreme logo and says ""The crystal..."" and I just burst out laughing again. Really? REALLY? The all powerful crystal of life, the thing that allows the humans of Earth to exist, is underneath a donut shop in Storybrooke. It's so incredibly dumb.The next scene is just the main bad girl eating a donut. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP! There is a movie based on a nostalgic property that a lot of people love, and their using this lure to show off Krispy Kreme! The movie was iffy before, but this? This feels wrong! No one should willingly sit through this! I did because I figured it would just be generic boring stuff, not a commercial for a donut shop!The movie just kinda ends, after Satan rises from Hell and grabs a bite from Krispy Kreme... sorry, I meant the Megazord rises from the crystal and grabs the main bad girl and blasts her off into space. Then the innocent bystanders, who have just kinda been background noise until now, only NOW whip out their phones and take pictures. Wait, they weren't before? When the main bad girl was destroying the town you weren't livestreaming it to 15 people on Instagram? What kind of town is this?Ultimately this movie was pretty bad. If you're looking for Power Rangers, watch the show instead. It's not worth all the stupid stuff in this movie for you to sit through just to get maybe 20 minutes of the Rangers. I will say this: after this film I said ""Down with the establishment!"" and got Dunkin Donuts instead.","

"seige-hound","28 March 2017","I liked watching Power Rangers. It was a good time, but I feel that the actual 'Power Rangers' part of Power Rangers was a missed opportunity. Let me explain.So, the film is about five teenagers (17-18 years-ish) who all have their personality quirks. Jason is a jock who gets busted for stealing a cow(?) and is under house arrest. Billy is an autistic guy with a knack for explosives. Kimberley is a mean girl cheerleader who was disowned by her friend group. Zach is a guy who skips school and is overly outgoing to compensate for the dread of possibly losing his sick mother. And Trini is a weirdo outcast who is implied to be a closeted lesbian.So we got this ragtag group of kids, all pretty likable with room to develop further, and they discover an alien spacecraft buried under hundreds of metres of rock, and five coloured 'coins' that give them superpowers.And for the first hour and a half or so, we get a pretty neat 'Chronicle meets Breakfast Club' high school drama going on. We get Bryan Cranston as Zordon, the spirit of a past Power Ranger, some robot thingy, and the villain Rita Repulsa, an ex-ranger who is hellbent on destroying the world, as per usual.Rita is pretty good, if a bit cheesy. She isn't quite as over the top as the original Rita from the show (at least from what I've seen) but she's in a similar vein, albeit a bit darker in tone. She's still crazy in a cheesy sort of way, but she is much more violent, and she is shown killing innocent people to get their gold tooth fillings (she's collecting gold to build a giant creature called Goldar, who is made of gold. Just go with it) I think that even through the cheese, she came across as a formidable foe for the teenagers.My main issue with this film, and the reason I rated it a 6/10 instead of higher, is that the climax is severely underwhelming. When the rangers finally morph into their suits, they look cool, but the action itself is boring. There are three major fight sequences in a 2 hour action film. One without their costumes, one in, and one with them riding the Zords, the latter one being the largest. I'm familiar enough with the show to know that this is pretty much how an episode is formatted, but the balance of action is a bit off for the average movie-going person.Now the character development is pretty solid, and I'll give them credit for actually developing the characters instead of assuming the viewer knows enough about the show to fill in the gaps. But I think they should have tried to strike a better balance between character and action. I'm not sure how they would be able to do that for this film, but my feelings remain the same.It is a good film, don't get me wrong. It's not an amazing film, but it's good, and I hope that they consider making a sequel with more, better action.","

"FeastMode","24 July 2019","Ummmmm guilty pleasure? Yes. Very fun and awesome, super nostalgia. Lots of cool action, although some was sloppy. This is a fun mindless movie. Lots of flaws and things you can make fun of but they didn't bother me because I was expecting it. And also because like the Ninja Turtles, some things can't really be done seriously in a live action movie. But I really enjoyed it. Good music too. (3 viewings, 8/13/2023)SPOILERSother than the little things you can make fun of, my biggest flaws with the movie are that Rita was kind of a joke, and that they only fought in their armor for like 60 seconds. I woulda liked to see more of that. And more of a focus on martial arts rather than superhero punches.","

"Hellmant","5 April 2017","POWER RANGERS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the superhero film series, based on the popular kids' TV show (from the 1990s). This one is a reboot that features new cast members, playing the main characters of the original TV series, with a modern origin story. It was directed by Dean Israelite (who also helmed the 2015 teen sci-fi flick 'PROJECT ALMANAC'), and it was produced by the series creator Haim Saban. John Gatins, Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney served as writers on the film; which also features a mostly inexperienced young new cast (including Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Becky G and Ludy Lin). The supporting cast also features Elizabeth Banks (as the evil villain), the voice of Bill Hader, and Bryan Cranston (who also voiced characters on the original TV show). The film has been a hit at the Box Office, but it's also only received mixed reviews from critics. I think it's a big improvement over the source material, but it's still nothing too special.The story begins on prehistoric Earth, when the Power Rangers (Earth's protectors) are betrayed by the Green Ranger, also known as Rita Repulsa (Banks). The Red Ranger, named Zordon (Cranston), hides the Rangers' powers coins (which are their power source). He then has his robot assistant, named Alpha 5 (Hader), cause a meteor strike; which wipes out Zordon, Rita and all of the dinosaurs (although Rita survives the blast, and so does Zordon's consciousness). In modern day, five misfit teenagers discover the power coins. They're then tasked with defending the planet, from Rita, by becoming a new team of Power Rangers, under the guidance of Zordon's consciousness.The movie is the most interesting when it's developing it's five teenage lead characters; and it definitely gets a lot of points for being the first major superhero film to feature LGBTQ and autistic superheroes. The story, and cheesy action scenes, are definitely a lot less interesting, and inspiring, than the teenage drama though. Those scenes are still pretty cheesy as well; although they're a lot better done than they were in the ultra-corny kids' TV show. I'd say it's a good movie for kids, at the very least, and it shouldn't bore adults too much either.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/208412653","

"Dark_Lord_Mark","14 June 2017","I really wanted to like this movie. This was PR, and based on the original classic TV show that has millions of fans and a cult like following.PLOT: Five Teens with too much attitude and zero likability and no real reason to be liked become heroes. This is what this movie was. It was jumbled mess and poorly written and acted. When you saw Elizabeth Banks cast as Rita, you knew it was already a shiitshow! ACTING/SCRIPT: The unknown actors couldn't really act and neither can Banks. Well at least as Rita. Besides the terrible script, the line delivery was a mess. The Teens had problems, but nothing that made you feel sorry for them. Each teen seemed to be awful people, and at no point does the writers attempt or at least succeed in making you like them. Everyone is a rule breaker, a bad boy or a bad girl.WRITING/CASTING: It felt the director and studio simply wanted diversity of cast rather than actors who can act. No one really fit their role outside and that includes miss banks. The studio seemed more interested in diversity and political correctness than the script.CGI/ACTION: The biggest flaw was the CGI. It's the easy way out and always seems to be the downfall of modern movies. The fight sequences were poorly done and hard to follow but. This was a bad movie without the heart of the original TV show and a jumbled mess. The music score also deserves a nod for how terrible it was.This Version of PR is a Bay-esque, poorly written, shot, acted and CGI-ed mess. Fans deserved better.","

"851222","17 June 2017","Greetings from Lithuania.In order for a movie ""Power Rangers"" (2017) to work and kinda deliver i think you need three main ingredients (or at least they worked for me):1. A boring evening with some good friends. 2. A ""leave your brain at the door"" mood. 3. Some light alcohol involved.I kinda found this movie to be not bad flick at all. It had some surprisingly very nice writing (for the material), some nice acting and humor which creates this ""don't get this to serious"" type of a mood. Although you still need to leave your brain at the door when watching this movie, i found it kinda involving. Sure this movie had to bring to a great Bryan Cranston the most easiest paycheck in his life but he does deliver simply by his voice - now this is a true talent. And while the whole plot of a second part of a movie could be summed up in a ""kinds movie - VERY young kinds movie"" line - it kinda worked for me - but those three above mentioned ingredients were involved. Not bad flick overall.","

"ThomasDrufke","27 March 2017","Power Rangers is pretty much exactly what I pictured it being. Big budgeted movie, cheesy enough to please the fans of the old TV series', but mature enough for most ages to enjoy. There's nothing new or exciting here, but the execution was about as updated as you can make a film about 5 outcasts coming together to save the world as armored rangers.Surprisingly, the one thing I think they did a good job of balancing was the tone. I'm in the minority, but the revolving tone of the movie is exactly what I think the movie needed to have, after having a chance to view it. Because of what the Rangers TV shows have been, it's hard to both recapture the tone and reinvent it for new audiences. For me, this movie did a nice job of establishing a new generation of Rangers in a more serious world, without sacrificing the goofy humor that most fans love. Did the humor hit the way the writers hoped? Probably not. The cheesy humor, or lack thereof, is in part because of Transformers-esque writing, but it also could fall on the shoulders of the directing and acting.It's difficult to cast a movie like this. People have a certain vision as to who each Ranger should be and represent. I give credit to Lionsgate for making one of the leads gay, and one autistic, but I didn't find any of the Rangers to be all that interesting. While fine overall, the acting didn't add anything to the typically generic coming of age dialogue. That is, besides a few performances. Elizabeth Banks is great as Rita Repulsa, a mixture of over-the-top popcorn fun and creepiness. I also found there to be a lot to like about Naomi Scott as Kimberly/Pink Ranger. When all the chips are down and each Ranger is breaking down their backstory, she was the only one I found myself emotionally connected to. Perhaps aware of all the hate towards the more serious DC films, and love towards the lighter Marvel films, Power Rangers saves it's most impressive action for the final 30 minutes. In all its CGI madness, there's no denying how nostalgic and fun the ride is. Sure, I'm not invested in the characters as much as I would have liked, but it's sure as heck better than the Transformers and Ninja Turtles films. Serviceable is a nice way to describe this one.+Undeniably fun+Banks & Scott-Script-Nothing new and surprising6.5/10","

It's not the case that the film is bad but the stereotyped and stale execution with predictable screenplay ruins the film and somewhere you'll feel that oh come on show us something new, we have seen this many times.The plot of the film is average and execution is below par and predictable. The acting is average to decent and screenplay of the film is also purely predictable. The climax of the film also doesn't excites much.If you are a die hard fan of power rangers and can see anything and everything then this is the film for you otherwise please ignore.","

"Reno-Rangan","13 October 2017","It was one of those films known that it would fail even before being made. I've rated the rebooted 'Fantastic Four' better than this. I am not a 'Power Rangers' fan, but I was looking forward to it. Expected to be a decent, not this low. The major issue with the film was the story. What the heck! All the superhero films have this same platform. That's really boring. Even that's how the real 'Power Rangers' is, does not matter, it should have been re-wrote completely. Just like they had updated the costumes from cloths to metal armours.As usual, the actors are not to be blamed. Those young guys did good. Direction, not bad too. The graphic, nothing new or that impressive. If we observe closely all the CGI shot, they do not look fine, especially if you know all this stuff like an animator or something. The villain was weak. But the entire film was like just an introduction. They had held up everything till the last quarters to bring all together and make a massive stand off between the good and the bad.Maybe it could work for kids. Those who liked Marvel and DC superhero films would only find it a trash. The best thing about the film is, it is watchable, despite everything are familiar and predictable. I'm not in favour of a sequel, but surely they will make one. And that's result would decide the franchise's future, which I think has a slim chance against those superhero films that already bagged the large sum of fans to its pocket. As I said, the remaining one are children, who are upcoming generation. So if the filmmakers target them, even the adults would sit quiet and watch without whining.4/10","

The action was really well shot and choreographed as well, in that you could actually see what they were doing and it looked good. My only complaint being that there could have been more of it.

This 21st century incarnation fulfills all these juvenile points, with hectic editing, clichéd dialogue, bad music & convenient predictability in nearly every story beat. Yet somehow, this unexpected remake is still silly-fun for middle-schoolers, with just the tiniest amount of narrative and character weight to engage adults, especially the nerdier ones. Like The Breakfast Club with karate, five misfit teenagers in detention stumble upon some ancient alien stones, which turn them into a team of superheroes who must fight an evil alien baddie named Rita (one of the most hilarious villain names ever). Other than Billy, the genius nerd with a Drax-like propensity for being too literal, the characters sort of get lost in the noise and color, written either too specific or too vague. However, the movie experience is largely pretty fun. In the style of movies like Chronicle and Raimi's Spider-Man, we watch these youth deal with their new powers with wide-eyed excitement. The action scenes are cartoonishly intense, the cinematography moves with surprising brains, and the climax is even a mild seat-clincher. Would this have worked better as a serialized TV show? Probably. The stuff in the bones of this universe is good, but its flesh is a bit flabby in this format. Still, as an old fan of this supremely stupid property, this is a nostalgic and sincere little fantasy outing. Go-go Power Rangers, indeed.","

"nightstalker-7","5 August 2017","People who are giving this movie low score is, because they're probably dumb kids from 95+ - 2005+ or something. I'm 1984 and I grew up on power rangers. This movie kind of managed to catch up the atmosphere and all what was in the genuine series, so cheers for that.Author had to do some stuff very fast, so the roles were shallow and...well, just like the genuine power rangers :)","

"kurisutofusan","21 February 2021","I'm not into Sentai series. Power rangers started when I was young and I watched a few without really getting interested.
I postponed watching this movie, assuming it would look cheap and geared toward kids.
However, the special effects tempted me to finally give it a try today and I'm not disappointed I did!
It was really enjoyable and I want a sequel!","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","28 June 2017","First they came for the TV shows of kids who grew up in the '80s. It was only a matter of time before they came for my shows. As for how this big-screen adaptation fairs, color me indifferent.I was 6 years old when Saban's ""Power Rangers"" made its way to Fox Kids programming. The impression that this campy show – made by weaving footage of ""teenagers with attitude"" in Angel Grove with a Japanese ""Super Sentai"" show – left on me was indelible with its colors, imagination and structure. Yet the ""Power Rangers"" and their decades of iterations generated nostalgia for a wide array of Millennials, and the oldest subset (to which I belong) is definitely not the target demographic of the 2017 ""reboot.""""Power Rangers"" takes aim at a 13-22 demographic to be sure with a story that combines ""Transformers"" with ""The Breakfast Club."" A lot of attention is paid to story and rooting these five Rangers in reality. They are outcasts and renegades who have made mistakes. They seem to be attractive and cool on the outside but all experience some kind of pain, something that will surely resonate with teen audiences in a today's era of digital appearances versus reality.But what screenwriter John Gatins (""Real Steel"") and the two writing duos who worked on the story put into character development takes away from the entertainment value. The action of ""Power Rangers"" is delayed, scarce and no more remarkable than anything seen in the ""Transformers"" films, despite director Dean Israelite's solidly kinetic direction. All the attention to giving the story some heart ends up taking away from the entertainment value.In other words, in an effort to avoid the pitfalls of a ""Transformers"" film (all bots and no emotions), ""Power Rangers"" ends up being one of those classic, overdone origin stories. A huge chunk of the movie is dedicated to the Rangers becoming worthy enough to morph into their armor, a step we know they will take. The fact that they earn it doesn't necessarily make the payoff sweeter when any fan of the movies knows it wouldn't be a ""Power Rangers"" movie if the Rangers didn't morph, or get in their Dino-Zords, or become the Megazord.The seriousness with which the film attends to character development also leaves someone like Elizabeth Banks as the evil sorceress, Rita Repulsa, out to dry. She's the only character who maintains the campy tone of the TV series, meaning that as funny as Banks can be, she stands out in a painfully awkward way when she's the only one making corny remarks – the humor among the Rangers is more modern campy (like when R.J. Cyler's Billy says ""Come at me, bro."")Camp doesn't play well in modern blockbusters, but historically it's an essential energy of the ""Power Rangers"" franchise. The movie does not embrace it, but neither can it avoid it – the whole series is about someone who just wants to take over the world and keeps making monsters to attack the same city, a plan that every time is thwarted by a group of teenagers. In approaching the material this way – focusing on character to make the ""Power Rangers"" content more meaningful yet not figuring out a way to make it equally more fun – the film straddles two incompatible tones. The film works toward and understands the value of both tones, but they only inhibit or contradict each other.On the positive side, the art direction brings the previously spandex-and-plastic-clad Power Rangers to life in a visually compelling way and the stars – Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Ludi Lin and Becky G – make the script's character work feel worth it.""Power Rangers"" is certainly not terrible, but struggles to be unique in a highly competitive blockbuster landscape. The elements of the film all feel borrowed from other superhero or teens with powers movies and not quite enough of the show's spirit makes the cut to give ample props for the nostalgia factor. Far from an embarrassment, but far from a success.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more","

"barbagvido","27 April 2017","Power Rangers is a sort of anticipated movie based on the popular kids show all 90s kids grew up with. I wouldn't really call myself a 90s kid since I was born at the end of the 90s, but I did watch some of the show as a kid. And while it wasn't a crucial part of my childhood, I remember watching it occasionally, so I was interesting in how this would turn out. And I'm not sure what I think about it.It tries to balance the light silly tone and the dark, more grounded approach. Does it manage? Nope. It tries to take itself seriously (while some really, really, REALLY cringy jokes are thrown into the mix) and then it goes full ""Screw it, this is based on a kids show!"" mode. And it just doesn't go well together. It's like they couldn't decide what movie they wanted to make. The acting has isn't very good either. Some actors tried, bit still didn't really stand out. But one bad performance stands out and that's Elizabeth Banks. I usually like her as an actress, but she was so over the top here that I sort of loved it. You can see she's having fun in this role and you are having fun watching her. She's definitely the most memorable part of the movie. And she's not the only unintentional laugh here. The whole movie is full of those (or sometimes just cringes). Especially if you're a bit dirty minded, a lot of lines will sound so, so wrong. But what lifts this movie up is that its fun, the actors have a lot of chemistry even though the acting is not much and the whole team and their relationship is very well established and it's probably the strongest point of the movie.Overall, I guess it's passable, it's fun. But I really don't know by what kind of standards and expectations one should watch the movie because of the tone issues.","

"TheOneThatYouWanted","4 May 2017","This movie surprised everyone by not su@king. And honestly the acting saves the film. The plot is good enough for what they needed to do. The movie is a reboot of the Power Rangers series from back in the days. Frankly Power Rangers never really left because of its hardcore fans but still, it needed to be rebooted into a new franchise. And so far so good, I approve of this reboot. It isn't great. The action did not feel as epic as it should for a major motion picture, mainly because of the setting. And the villain is the annoying sore thumb of the film. But yeah, like a said before the acting was good and the actors had good chemistry; all except that one girl in yellow. Whatever, it's alriiiight. 7 out of 10.","

"crakatoot","23 March 2017","I remember watching the premiere back when I was six years old, and... I thought it was idiotic. The original show was always to goofy for me, even as a little boy. But I had nothing to do and I had some movie passes so I decided to check it out. It's actually pretty good. A lot of critics are going into this expecting to hate it and their reviews reflect that. In the reviews I've read or seen, I keep hearing things like ""Well its not as stupid as it could have been"" or ""Some of it wasn't so terrible"" or other equally back handed compliments. The reality is, the Power Rangers is an inherently silly idea. But once you get past that, this is a pretty fun movie. You know the drill, five kids get together in Angel Grove, a much grittier Angel Grove than I remember. They get their hands on some power coins, Rita Repulsa shows up and some over the top action ensues. So yes, it is just a bigger version of what we saw on the show, but still effective. It takes itself more seriously than the show did and it is much darker. But it doesn't go to far, it still feels close to the original and it does have its lighter moments. Its biggest strength though was the chemistry between the leads. The five kids really worked well with each other. And they did spend time developing each of them. They definitely worked well as a team. And Elizabeth Banks killed it as Rita. I've heard some reviewers complain that she was to over the top, but no way. Rita is supposed to be over the top. You can tell Banks was having a lot of fun. She had a particularly brutal scene with the Trini the Yellow Ranger. And needles to say, the climax was awesome. The new Zords, the new costumes, they looked great. If I had one complaint, and it is a bit odd, the two girls are a little to similar. The three boys are all distinct. But the two girls, they even look way to much alike. Once the costume are on, then it's easy to tell. And if your a big fan of the series, pay attention, there are a few references here and there.","

"jpachar82","11 July 2017","Debuting on August 28, 1993 as the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the franchise started out as just a little show about some teenagers gaining powers and defeating the evil that was lurking in the shadows of the world. Now enter into 2017, as the Power Rangers come back with a whole new and powerful way of taking on the forces that derail, so to speak, alien forces to take over the world. With the help of the Saban family, Dean Israelite (the director of the new film), took the Power Rangers to a whole new level. As young teenagers, who face life's biggest issues and being isolated from the world, they forge together a new bond, a bond that is stronger than adhesive tape, a powerful bond that links them together for eternity. With a threat, that will help tear them apart, played seductively and beautifully by the one alien woman that would be the breaking point of the Rangers – Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks – The Hunger Games franchise), she will stop at nothing to take over the world. I loved this movie, didn't think I would, but I would love to see where they are going to take the story and the characters.","

"Mysterygeneration","6 January 2024","Power Rangers is a visually stunning, action-packed movie that pays respect to its original material by fusing nostalgia with a contemporary perspective. The ensemble, comprising a diverse group of actors, infuses their roles with charm and enthusiasm, creating a relatable bond with the audience. The movie does a good job of updating the beloved franchise with modern themes and a more complex treatment of individual backstories. But occasionally, the plot feels predictable, leaning too much on teenage superhero clichés, and the pacing drags. The film's spectacle is enhanced by the CGI effects, although sometimes they take center stage over the character-driven elements, which makes room for a more well-rounded story. Fans of the original series will find Power Rangers appealing, but others may wish for a more inventive and seamless storytelling technique.","

"samyoung-82648","31 March 2017","I've been waiting a few years for Hollywood to introduce some diversity back into films. Female ninja warrior & CEO & scientist & hacker in 1: done to death. Idiot male cast : done to death. Black infallible hero : done to death. This movie is none of those.We've got a black computer nerd who is also autistic. Awesome! Progress. We've got female bullies. Awesome! Thought Hollywood banned them. We've got a reasonable male lead who is strong and not stupid. Progress!None of the characters is especially strong, they depend on each other. The females aren't arrogant, each of the characters feels sincere (except the female villain who is somewhat silly).If you're looking for a fun flick that avoids the usual sexist politics, go see this movie. It won't win any awards and it will be forgotten in 2 years. However, they shook off the usual stereotype you've seen in the last 50 blockbusters.Well done to everybody who made this movie. It was radical (ie. avoiding sexist stereotypes). I'm glad someone had the courage.Highly recommended.","

"Daniels_review","4 March 2021","What do we have here...?
To be honest: Nothing special. This movie can be split in two parts. In the first part you see the Teenagers becoming the Power Rangers, in the second part the fight.The first part is more interesting then you would think for a superhero movie. It shows you the life of every single character and the struggles they have to deal with. All of this is needed so they can finally form up to a team and become the rangers. This part is good if you like stuff like this. Its about teenagers so it come a bit cheesy. (Every single one of them is a misfit and they open up about it.) The big problem is, that even in one and a half hours you can't fit the story of 5 people AND the story of the whole power rangers thing. So even if this is an important part it falls a bit flat. (And you end up with a hard time remembering even all of the five names.The second part is about the fight. And sadly it looses everything for me. Im serious, the fight scenes are just not good. Started interesting when they fight in their suits but goes downhill when they got into their zords.Watching it you could thinks that this is a movie for children/teenagers (I mean.... You know...?) What really bothers me about it, is the first scene where you find a joke about one guy jerk off a cow. So is it for kids? Or not?Conclusion: If this is for children or teenagers the film in it self is ok (just the first scene...) if this is for adults, then it is actually bad. So you can watch it, just don't expect too much from it. The character part is good, the fight part is really bad. So don't go for the fights, go for the story. If you don't want this, then better don't watch it.","

"ksuever_009","24 March 2017","Before I begin, I must tell you one of the biggest spoilers of this movie. IT'S NOT LIKE THE TV SHOW FROM THE 90s! If you grew up watching it like I did, this will be a little different than the one our generation grew up with. Trust me when I tell you, that's a good thing. Imagine if Batman movies still had the likeness of Adam West's portrayal of Batman from the 60s! It would be lame and people would get sick of it! That being said, let's dive in!THE TV SHOW VS THE MOVIE This movie still has the core values that make up the lore of the Power Rangers: They still morph. They still have to join forces as a team to stop evil. They still need to call on their Zords when they need more power. Rita is still out to destroy the world and take over. Goldar makes an appearance, but he doesn't speak.The things that separate this movie from the TV show are: They don't have fighting skills starting out; they have to train. They are given super powers like strength and speed that let them punch harder, jump higher and so on. They can't morph at first because they don't have the skill to do so. They need to draw the power out that exist inside of them. Zordon even makes them feel bad about it by saying ""If you can't morph, you aren't rangers."" What a jerk! LOLTHE PLOT The movie opens up with Zordon (Bryan Cranston) fighting Rita, and losing. In his last attempt to stop her, he knocks her into the ocean and she is in a state of hibernation until present day. Zordon, with his last breaths, seals away the power coins, or rocks if you'd prefer, for a future team of rangers to find. Skip ahead to present day and you see Jason, Kimberly, and Billy all in Saturday morning detention. They all made mistakes, and they all are paying for it. They eventually meet the other two members of the team, Zack and Trini at a digging site. Billy's father died and I assume he was a scientist of some sort. Billy has a fascination with rocks and blows into some rocks and the team discovers the power crystals. When he blew the rocks that exposed the crystals, security forces were called in to find out who was playing around with explosives. The team escapes in Billy's mother's minivan. As they approach a train crossing they attempt to make it but don't. Oddly, they all wake up at home but notice they have powers. They all meet up at the site again and find the secret lair to Zordon's fortress. They encounter Alpha-5 (BTW HE DOES SAY ""AYE, YI, YI, YI, YI!"" He says it once, and it's not annoying!) They are introduced to Zordon's essence; which is another way of saying the original Zordon is gone, but he can still come back. Zordon wants the new rangers to help him come back, but to do that, they need to prove they are capable of morphing. Morphing, apparently comes from the inside out. It sounds cheesy, but it looks awesome! The group cannot do it and so, Zordon makes them train without armor. They get the snot beaten out of them! It makes it more realistic from the viewer's standpoint. They didn't ask for this, they didn't want this, they are just kinda rolling with it, and they eventually earn the role. (It reminds me of Spider-man, the Toby McGuire films.) They were gifted powers they don't know how to use because they never had them before. It makes you want to see them toughen up and grow as super heroes! After going through that process, Alpha-5 shows them the Zords ""when you're ready, you will pilot these,"" he tells them. Zack can't wait, and he steals one and drives it, horribly. Later that night, Rita visits Trini at home and threatens to kill her if she doesn't tell Rita where the Zeo Crystals are. Rita mocks Trini because she cannot morph, and then offers her to join Rita against Zordon. She gives her an ultimatum, and requests that she meet her to make her decision. Rita threatens that ""tomorrow I will destroy your city."" Trini meets with the other rangers and tells them about the encounter. They meet Rita and try to fight her without armor and get their butts handed to them. She kills Billy after finding out from him, where the crystals are located. The team take Billy to Zordon and then, because of their efforts, acting as real rangers, Zordon can return. He doesn't. He uses that power to bring Billy back to life. The rangers morph and then head out to stop Rita. They use their skills and armor to beat down Putties, and eventually call on their Zords. They stop Rita by combining their Zords. When they defeat Rita, she tells the rangers that ""others will come, it won't be just me!"" (I hope she means Lord Zed!). Jason asks her to give up her power crystal and staff, and surrender to Zordon. She refuses, and they literally B!@CH SLAP her into space. As she ascends into space, she hibernates again, turning to ice.FINAL THOUGHTS This movie is nothing like the TV show I grew up with in the 90s. I have fond memories of that show from when I was a kid, but it matured. For that I am thankful! It was fun to watch, and it brought the little kid inside of me out. My kids loved it, and I can certainly say it exceeded my expectations! It's not like the show I remembered, but that's okay. It's actually better IMHO. BTW, there were two rangers from the TV show that cameoed towards the end. I won't spoil that for you! 😉","

"Screen_Blitz","28 June 2017","Who would have expected for Saban's cheesy, yet popular television franchises to spear their way back on the silver screen? Unless you were a child growing in the 90s or early-to-mid 2000s as the fan of the one of the TV shows, chances are you were expecting the team of teenagers confined into their robotic suits to decimate into obscurity. Against those odds, Dean Israelite, the director behind the mediocre found-footage thriller 'Project Almanac', becomes the operator of the first Power Rangers film to hit the theaters since the abysmal sequel titled 'Power Rangers Turbo' two decades ago. In a shocking conclusion, this teen superhero boasts a surprising amount of competence compared to the overwhelming goofiness that defined the original source material. Tearing away from the television shows' campy style in favor of a slightly gritter approach, Israelite somewhat proves that you can uproot more competence out of a source material that is highly unknown for harvesting a lick of intelligence. That is not to say that his execution kicks off on a clunky start. This film follows a group of high school strangers: mischievous Jason (played by Dacre Montgomery), former cheerleader Kimberly (played by Naomi Scott), smart, but bullied loner Billy (played by (RJ Cyler), a social outcast Trini (played by Becky G), and a lonely Asian Zack (played by Ludi Linn). Upon coming across a mysterious alien ship underground, these teens acquire uncanny superpowers and are enlisted by a computerized-being named Zordon (voiced by Bryan Cranston) and his robotic dwarf Alpha-5 (voiced by Bill Hader) to save the world against an evil queen named Rita Repulsa (played by Elizabeth Banks). By far the easiest and arguably most predictable achievement this film acquires from Dean Israelite's direction is generating immense nostalgia for fans of the television series. The most notable element would be splicing in the theme song at the height of the climatic battle sequence. Israelite's directorial efforts on bringing the popular source material to life however, finds no escape from the flaws that riddle the final product. Rather than introducing the character as veterans of the titular superhero squad, the movie boasts an origin story follows the genesis of the teens acquiring their powers. Spending the first half establishing each of the teen's backgrounds, one of which involves the Asian kid coping the sickness of his mother, another involving a teen girl questioning her sexuality upon meeting these new others. That is right! the superhero genre has just gave birth to their first LGBT superhero. Anyway, the film does show a muscle with character development rather settling generic high school stereotypes. But what about the fun? The main problematic aspect here is the struggle to bring back the campy, if cheesy fun that made the original television franchises entertaining. Whether it is from sore lack of superhero action up until the final twenty minutes or the clunky tonal shifts, the excitement of the titular heroes fight to save the world feels shallow. The climatic battle sequence at the end is somewhat fun and visually appealing, but is nothing impressive. The performances from the cast are mostly solid, though Elizabeth Banks's hammy portrayal as the villain Rita Repulsa feels somewhat out of place. There's a few well landed attempts at humor along dozens of laughable one-liners dealing with Krispy Kreme. What is up? Was the director trying to disguise this movie into a two-hour commercial for a donut shop. Maybe not, but it almost feels like it.Power Rangers is surprisingly proficient adaptation of the source material of the same name with some goods to offer, but perhaps not much so for those unconverted to the Power Ranger fandom. Above all, it is more than likely the nostalgia of the popular television shows will triumph over the writing and direction. Entertained or not, there is a hint of a sequel lurking upon the horizon.","

"joshbarton15","26 March 2017","With the major box-office success of something like the Transformers franchise, I'm surprised that it's taken until 2017 to reboot the Power Rangers franchise for a modern audience. An avid viewer of the original television series back in the 90s, there was no way I was going to miss their first big screen appearance in twenty years.When a group of high-school kids; Jason (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly (Naomi Scott), Billy (RJ Cyler), Trini (Becky G) and Zack (Ludi Lin), uncover an ancient spaceship, they discover the power coins they stumbled upon have given them superpowers. Meeting Zordon (Bryan Cranston), via his consciousness that has been uploaded to the ship, they learn that they must harness their new abilities and become the Power Rangers, before the evil Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) destroys all life on Earth.There is no denying that Power Rangers is cinematic trash and the film's biggest flaw is that it doesn't fully embrace the fact that is what it is, leading to the film becoming a complete and utter tonal mess, unable to decide whether it wants to be an edgy superhero film full of teen angst or an all out cheesy superhero film. In the end it chooses to be both and the film really does suffer because of it.This is Power Rangers for crying out loud so I expect the over-the-top cheesy finale that unfolds once they morph for the first time however, when this finale comes after ninety minutes of semi- serious build up, it just doesn't fit together at all. That's another problem this film has; it's way too long, clocking in at just over two hours.The semi-serious side is weighed down by backstories of these misfits who meet while attending Saturday detention but The Breakfast Club this is not. There is way too much baggage attached to these characters, including Billy's autism which was in danger of becoming a gimmick. It's commendable to include such a thing, as well as one of the characters being gay however, there's no need to make such a song and dance about it.There is fun to be had with Power Rangers mind. From the moment they fully become the Power Rangers right through until the end I felt like a 90s kid again sat in front of the television on a Saturday morning. I did find the build up to all of that tolerable it's just I wish they'd have settled on making the rest of the film as batshit crazy as its final act.There isn't really much that can be said about the acting in this film other than the five playing the Power Rangers aren't all that bad and Elizabeth Banks has an absolute ball hamming it up as Rita Repulsa, a villain who has nothing about her except being pure evil, which makes a change for once.Power Rangers didn't disappoint me at all because I wasn't expecting it to be anything but a poor film. My suggestion would be to switch off all brain cells, get the biggest tub of popcorn and just let the insanity take over.","

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","In one of the many gritty reboots of a nostalgic 1990's franchise, I didn't have much expectation for Power Rangers (2017). The original show was pretty campy, with a tried-and-true plot structure that didn't change much from episode to episode. In fact, I probably couldn't tell you the specific plot of any of the episodes. They'd usually follow this format: the main villain would go about trying to obtain some goal via their minions/henchmen, the Power Rangers would morph and fight the minions/henchmen, the minions/henchmen would grow large and start destroying everything, the Power Rangers would call their Zords out to battle, and (finally) the Zords would combine into the Megazord and the foe would be vanquished.While Power Rangers did follow some of the structure of the television show format, it also managed to create characters with some depth and background to them. From a disgraced football star to an autistic teen who doesn't get jokes to a cyber-bully cheerleader to a (possibly) bisexual loner to a reckless mother's boy, the five teenagers certainly have their share of angst and diversity. I do give kudos to the scriptwriters for including characters that feel distinctly modern without being too preachy about it.And yet, while Power Rangers has a lot going for it, including plenty of action and a modicum of nostalgia, there are still a few flaws. Some of the humor is a bit juvenile, especially for a PG-13 film. I also couldn't help but recognize the quite familiar setup of The Breakfast Club (1985), even to the point where I wanted the film to end with the Red Ranger holding a defiant fist in the air while ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" plays in the background. Was this supposed to be a reboot of The Breakfast Club instead of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers?A surprisingly well-done nostalgic reboot, I give Power Rangers 4.0 stars out of 5.","

"Snootz","16 July 2017","While not a ""bad"" movie, one has to realize that a movie named ""Power Rangers"" isn't going to appeal to much of anyone over 10 years of age. But beyond that, this flick is a slow-moving, anti-climatic, dull and insensible let-down of both scripting and directing.On the one hand, unlike Transformers one can always tell what is going on. But that's mainly because very little is going on. From the poorly-choreographed fight scenes to the lame dialog, Power Rangers is a yawner from beginning to end.On a positive note the armored suits were a step-up from the series. No more latex and spandex sissy-suits here; this is some decent (if colorful) battle armor. I would give them thumbs-up on the CGI but face it... at this period of time, basic CGI is old-hat and cliché. Booorrinnng. Not because I'm an action junkie but rather the exact opposite: action without substance is pointless (which is one reason I can't tolerate Transformers).The only thing that could have saved this movie would have been choosing another theme entirely. Then start with a story that's beyond the trite ""bad person wants to destroy everything"" plot, and some characters that are more than 2-dimensional attempts at failed sympathy votes.I would have given this 5 points except for the innuendos that children likely didn't understand and adults would consider and juvenile and offensive bathroom humor. That lost them one star that would have graded the film as ""mediocre"". As it is, 4 stars is generous. Next time people, find a better-quality outdated theme to re-hash. Or at least make a movie that doesn't drive even existing fans to wrist-slashing despair.","

"rsmstr","9 April 2023","I don't know why this movie got so much hate and ridicule.I watched the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers show a decent amount as a kid and the movie a LOT.I remember seeing this movie in theaters a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed it, crying and cheering with nostalgia.I rewatched it recently and it's still a great fun watch. Sure it has its flaws but they are MINOR compared to how it feels overall.The actors did damn good job portraying the characters we all know and loved.Definitely deserved a sequel and then some, especially considering the teaser for Tommy, the green ranger, at the end.","

"ReelLifeReviews","25 March 2017","Power Rangers (2017) - Dust off your Mossimo t-shirts and JNCO jeans, everyone, because if the Power Rangers can make a comeback, anything is possible.I had a lot more fun with this movie than I thought I would. Australian actor Dacre Montgomery led the way as the red ranger and was the standout overall. His role lent to this, but he very easily could have fallen flat. I would expect to see him in more films going forward.There weren't any big names in the new crew, and while some were stronger than others, they did quite well as a whole. They played well off of one another and I bought the group dynamic early on. It did have a few big names in other roles with Brian Cranston, Elizabeth Banks, and Bill Heder. Brian Cranston played a giant head in the wall that is basically just a surly old man the whole time. Elizabeth Banks seemed like she filmed all of her scenes before the producers decided to actually take the project seriously. And Bill Heder does the voice of a cartoon robot mascot that just did not work for me on any level.There are definitely some campy moments and a plot hole or two, but they don't undermine what ends up being a satisfying trip down memory lane. If you weren't a fan of the TV show or had never seen it, this probably isn't the movie for you. But if you are a true kid of the 90's, then Go Go - 6.5/10","

"trinaboice","3 April 2017","Grade: C+Rating: PG-13, 124 minutesIn a Nutshell: Does anyone actually care about the Power Rangers anymore? My 4 sons absolutely loved itback in the day, but I didn't think it was even relevant to kids anymore. Seems like just a morphin cash grab to me in more ways than one.Uplifting theme: Friendship, loyalty, teamwork, sacrifice Things I liked: Fans of the Power Rangers will probably enjoy it just for old time's sake. The characters are pretty well fleshed out with back stories, which pleasantly surprised me. The training sequences were pretty fun. Bryan Cranston is awesome in everything. Did you know he actually voiced some of the characters in the original 1990's TV show? Cool. Billy Cranston's character in the movie was actually named after Bryan Cranston. Even cooler. Their outfits have definitely gotten an upgrade.Things I didn't like: Krispy Kreme gets HUGE product placement. Kind of weird, right? Product placement always kind of annoys me, because it's so manipulative and an obvious cash grab. In this case, it's a BIG part of the story line. Did you hear that Krispy Kreme is actually changing the name of the company in England, because customers there can't figure out how to pronounce it correctly? True story. Most of the lead teenagers are super annoying delinquents who are rude, self-absorbed, and whiny. They almost try to out-do each other to see which one of them is least understood and outcast. Even before the five teenagers get their special powers, they're involved in very dangerous activities. These kids are not great role models. Of course, they finally figure out how to work as a team and sacrifice for each other (not a big spoiler alert), but I didn't like most of them. On top of that, they all buy into killing Rita within minutes. Rita Repulsa. What a name. Ha ha. Instead of declaring her intentions to conquer the world or the universe, she pretty much just trashes a little town. Ha ha Elizabeth Banks' accent seemed off, but I appreciate that she was trying to go over-the-top campy like the original TV character did. Some bad editing moments. The original 90's TV show was super cheesy and knew it. That's what made it really fun. This movie mixes up the cheese with serious drama, so it often feels disjointed in tone. For an origin story, it's fairly cliché. There are some really inappropriate jokes. It's kind of like the directors picked out what special effects they wanted to use and then built a story around it.Funny lines: ""Yippee Kayay, Mother Fu.Mother. Mother's good."" – Blue Ranger (R.J.Cyler) ""You five are the Power Rangers!"" – Alpha 5 (Bill Hader) ""Are we like Iron Man or Spiderman?"" – Blue Ranger ""My guess is we have 11 years. No, days. Eleven days."" – Alpha 5 ""I'm pretty sure I'm a super hero."" – Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott) ""Pee in that cup!"" – Kimberly Hart's mom ""Jason, did you just slap her?"" – Blue Ranger ""I did. Weird, right?"" – Jason Lee Scott/Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery) ""Sorry, Bumblebee!"" – Blue Ranger (Transformer reference)Dumb lines: ""Take that!"" – Pink Ranger ""Bring it on!"" – Pink Ranger ""We got this!"" – Pink Ranger ""My family is so normal. Too normal."" – Yellow Ranger (Becky G)Tips for parents: Lots of fighting and destruction. A surprising amount of profanity. There are some subtitles you'll have to read for little ones. There are several inappropriate jokes that will, hopefully, go over the heads of most kids.","

"markthomassintek","17 August 2017","POWER RANGERS REVIEWOK honestly I didn't like the TV programmes so came to the film with my mind almost made up, wrong I know because I do pride myself on being independent and impartial when doing these reviews.The film, first half where they basically aquure the powers very enjoyable actually, with each character having a back story but I'm sorry to say that once they aquure their powers and start being the Power Rangers all of the hard work previously building up the story and characters is lost.Second half corny, cheesy and actually a disappointment because....... well if you ever watched the Power Rangers you can predict what's going to happen.Kids will love it but if your a grown up who watched it as a child....... well first half great second half 😞Rating 4 out of 10","

"graphicsamdalton","5 January 2018","While stumbling through Netflix I saw this film advertised and was surprised to see a new full feature Power Ranger film had been released. I decided to give it a go and was honestly very pleasantly surprised.Power Rangers was never my favorite show as a child. I was always more into Transformers and Dragonball Z; they were always darker, the fight scenes 
were more intense and less ridiculous than a group of teenagers in silly looking colored coded suits; like a selection of angry crayons fighting against disabled monsters. Being born in 1990, alot of my friends would watch it when I went to their house though so I still feel like it's not only part of my childhood but also something I remember fondly on the whole (although I definitely don't have the same level of fandom some people writing reviews here seem too). The action is good, the Zoids are pretty amazing and I have to agree with another reviewer I actually preferred them to the Micheal Bay Transformers. They are clean and simple, not overly complicated and difficult to distinguish making the fight scenes in them clearer and easier to watch. The Megazoid transformation is great and I thought the level of CGI was quite impressive throughout but not mind blowing. But what made the film great to me was the general moral code of the Power Rangers. It was just... nice. Perhaps this narrative is slightly cliche now, it's a fairly standard action film but I felt it sincere. Troubled kids meet each other by chance/fate/destiny and would sincerely die for each other only after a few days of knowing one another. They love each other and want to do right by each other as friends and as people. They genuinely do not hesitate* to take up the mantle as save others lives like heroes. I think that is admirable, and a great role model for children to look up. The Rangers are also quite identifiable as people, with real teenage troubles that cover a wide spectrum that kids and teens will relate too. The whole lesbian thing with Trini (Yellow Ranger) was very briefly delved into and although Billy (Blue ranger) didn't feel autistic if I'm honest he was still one of the best characters, outside of Alpha.I would give this movie a shot. Try not to be crazy disappointing when you realise this is not a nostalgia trip but more of a reboot and re imagining. There is one nice scene with the power rangers theme that made me smile but outside of that, I don't think you'll get a warm fuzzy buzz from remembering and comparing it to the original Power Rangers. Which is a good thing because the original Power Rangers is terrible and a cheese fest. Enjoy it for what it is; a pretty good action movie for teens, with a feel good message about teamwork, friendship, self-love, personal healing and the power of cooperation.
* Well slightly at first, but they have alot to digest and I'm unsure if I would trust a giant talking head and a strange but very good humored robot. Why they know English is beyond me. But they build robot dinosaurs so maybe instantly picking a language and knowing the personal details of peoples lives is childsplay.","

"rtwerk-36870","26 June 2017","I will admit right off the bat that this movie is a perfect example of a pet peeve of mine: sloppy writing. Although it is not entirely the writers' fault. There is only an hour's worth of movie and the rest is padding. We don't see actual Power Rangers until an hour and a half into a two hour movie. If their target audience was 15 year olds, then the crappy story isn't so much of a problem. By the time the Power Rangers finally show up... I've stopped caring. And I didn't think it would be possible, but Elizabeth Banks is totally miscast and downright horrible. I had 15 minutes left on the movie and gave up. Didn't even care how it ended.","

"chera_khalid","29 September 2023","Power Rangers, a nostalgic revival that, despite its earnest efforts, left me yearning for more. The young cast gives it their all, but the acting often treads the line between genuine and forced. The film editing attempts to modernize the classic Rangers narrative, but the pacing falters, making the movie feel disjointed. The strength lies in the film's attempt to inject depth into the characters, adding layers to the superhero origin story. However, the weakness lies in the struggle to balance campy nostalgia with a more mature tone, resulting in a tonal mishmash that doesn't quite hit the mark. The music tries to capture the essence of the '90s series, but it occasionally feels out of sync with the updated visuals. Cinematography, while at times visually striking, doesn't fully elevate the film beyond its TV show roots. At 8/10, Power Rangers is a valiant attempt to reignite childhood memories but falls short of morphing into the superhero spectacle it aims to be.","

"jaysanchu07","3 December 2023","Dang, Dean Israelite had us fooled with Power Rangers' potential offerings. From its marketing stints, the film seemed poised to tap onto our childhood nostalgia with some old fashioned morphin time, with a promise of 21st century filmmaking elements that elevates. It is then a massive disappointment that this adaptation was a fiasco of teenage melodrama, that dragged on for most of its runtime. It is then easy to forget, that this was a superhero movie. Worse, its messages were confusing & never compelling, a waste of time & energy. When Israelite finally foregoes the cheese-fest & steps on the pedal, the action spectacle was frustratingly unworthy of the time consuming debacle. It was lame & claims NO PLACE within the genre's recent toe-to-toe bad assery. As for its superhero lineup, the Power Rangers were a mishmash of uninteresting characters that consists of the usual teenage tropes, weakened further by overused backstories, annoying mannerisms & serious lack of chemistry. Sadly, Rita Repulsa doesn't escape the atrocious dramatis personae writing, with her laughable spiels, generic motivations & lame-ass prowess.In case not clear, Power Rangers is a drama-thon bust that parades itself as an action-packed fanfare. Hollywood ruins yet another childhood memory.","

"rs403404","8 April 2017","By the time ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" went big, I was teenager. I have seen random episodes, but my primary takeaways from the series is that the characters don't have discernible personalities beyond being either the good guys or the bad guys, the Power Rangers are incapable of doing anything without a sound effect, the town of Angel Grove should be a battle ground-graveyard from all the Godzilla style battles, and, finally, the Pink Ranger is hot (highly important to teenage me).It's important to understand that I'm not approaching this movie with fond memories of the original. I try not to enter the theater with preconceived notions. However, I did not look forward to this movie- -at all. Bearing that in mind, I was shocked by how much this movie worked and how close it was to being something really special. I say close because some glaring issues held it back. First, the movie's few attempts at humor are cringeworthy. After a solid intro, we soon cut to a beastiality joke. It's a similar joke that worked in ""Kingpin"", but is out of place in this movie. Sadly, the remainder of the jokes play about as well.Second, when the Power Rangers actually become Power Rangers, the movie takes on the feel of a formulaic episode. They fight putties, then a big monster attacks Angel Grove which allows for a big mech vs monster battle. What's interesting is the movie is at it's strongest when we spend time with the title characters. The rangers are portrayed by likable, talented young actors. Consequently, what was a huge weakness for the source material is a strength here. Nevertheless, once the characters morph, that quality mostly disappears inside their costumes.However, that brings us to the third and most glaring major issue and it's not something I usually care about, but it's intense here-- product placement. Comparatively, ""Man of Steel""s placements of IHOPs were downright subtle when viewed alongside the appearances of Krispy Krème in this movie. The product placement first appears about halfway through, starts obvious and quickly becomes obnoxious throughout the remainder of the film. There's even a moment when the villainous Rita Repulsa takes time out of her battle to destroy the world to lovingly eat doughnuts. One can't help but wonder how much Krispy Krème paid for this? Is it possible they are the sole sponsor?These glaring flaws in the midst of what could have been a credible movie make ""Power Rangers"" feel like an opportunity lost. Still, the fact that it is as good as it is when it's based on a series like ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" must be viewed as something of a minor miracle.","

"ctowers21","24 March 2017","Power rangers does exactly what it sets out to do. This origin story feels like a breakfast club reboot where the kids get super powers. The relationships in this movie are rarely seen in superhero movies and the actors knock their performances out of the park. All of the story feels real and the audience feels emotionally attached to these characters. The movie is very well directed by Dean Isrealite with all the CGI and background settings looking unlike the power rangers of past. The movie features star like performances from the relatively new faces of the five power rangers with Dacre Montgomery (red), Naomi Scott (pink) and RJ Cyler sticking out. Most of the story is genre defying and sets a tone for the movies to follow,However, Elizabeth banks seems to be completely over acting her entire part. Her cheesy, almost comical representation of Rita make it seem like she is in a different movie and with a completely different tone than the five power rangers along with zordon (played by Bryan Cranston). Her cheesy dialog and facial expressions bring down this movie and makes the audience think what could have been.Overall, this movie has a great amount of heart and tremendous performances from some soon to be stars that leaves the audience craving sequels to this could be great franchise, even with the miss by Elizabeth banks. Whether you were a fan of the original TV show or have no prior knowledge, people will get what they are hoping for out of this potentially massive success of a franchise.","

"mitesh-12997","18 June 2017","Considering how awful the TV Power Rangers are, this movie was quite good. The story line starts off well, explains the characters back grounds and who they are and then goes into how they become the power rangers. The middle part of the film did drag on, felt like the writers and directors ran out of things to fill it with, we get they need training but to much of it filled the middle part of the film. The end section had great fight scenes, went well with the overall story and set in motion for future movies. Overall, good start that could have been something tragic like the ghost busters remake. Worth watching once though, wouldn't watch again as its one of those movies, watched once then forgotten.","

"autisticreviewers","23 March 2017","For all those people that aren't aware this is a reboot of the Power Rangers. It has nothing to do the original ones. The Power Rangers have been around now for a long time and only 2 of their movies have made it to the big screen ""Mighty Morphin Rangers Movie"" and ""A Turbo Rangers Movie."" This is the third Power Rangers movie brought to the Screen. Also being a PG-13 Rated movie really says a lot. It's obvious to expect a bit more full on action and violence.First of all the acting was not that great. But that's not too surprising as the Power Rangers series and movies were never about great acting. Elizabeth Banks and the voices of Bill Hader and Bryan Cranston really did steal the entire show. While it didn't save the film they were definitely the highlights. The CGI was pretty bad. We both imagine that some scenes would look great in 3-D, a lot of it involving slow motion and car crashes. But the CGI was not really an update to the year 2017. it's obvious they were trying to also keep it like the good old Fox Kids days, but it it looked like it was trying to look good at the same time.If you really are looking to spend a weekend out with your family or grew up watching and loving the Power Rangers there is a chance you may feel like a good kid again, but all in all while the movie did have its moments of good it just really isn't worth seeing in the cinema. Maybe try renting it on Netflix when it's out. That's not to say other people will love it and enjoy it. We're sure others will adore this film, but for us it didn't quite hit the mark. The Autistic Reviewers give this 2/5 stars. 5/10. Check us out on facebook or Instagram. Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers.","

"timfongmk","25 March 2017","I went into the theater expecting a gritty reboot, but the film surprised me with its lighthearted humor and characters who wear their hearts on their sleeves.I am glad, that, unlike other reboots of beloved franchises in recent years, Power Rangers 2017 never pretentiously strives to be more than its source material, or reinvent the wheel. In doing so, it manages to capture some of the spirit of the original series, although there were times the lack of gravitas gave me the feeling of a made for TV movie. But alas, the cheesy set up, the straight forward storytelling, and unlikely friends overcoming the odds was part of the charm of the original power rangers, and retaining these elements is no sin in my book.Despite the main cast being teens, I felt the camaraderie the humor (especially from Billy, a subdued, modern day Steve Urkel), was just believable and entertaining enough to shape the rangers into likable characters without too much annoying angst or soap. Breakfast Club Lite, if you will. The trade off is its all a bit cloying and somewhat limited in its exploration of the team's individual personalities.To balance out the feel good teens, Elizabeth Banks is fabulously fun as the nasty (literal) golddigger vilainess Rita Repulsa, straddling the fine line between gross, evil, and over the top corny, with a bit of sexy thrown in. Almost any scene in the movie with her involved is a highlight.But alas, for the nerd in me, this movie's biggest sin is that there's not enough ranger action. Or any action, period. With a training montage and a few brief fights sprinkled in between, the movie only brings out the big guns for its finale. The Power Rangers in their suits barely get any fighting in against poorly designed enemies that block out much of the screen much of the time. And when it all finally goes to hell, the final setpiece is disappointingly on the generic side, in a post Michael Bay Transformers sort of way. Large CG metal and rock pieces flash across the screen without the viewer really able to distinguish the details, a far cry from the low budget but excellently choreographed sentai action sequences from the original Japanese production.Ultimately, Power Rangers 2017 is the most expensive made for Saturday morning TV movie you will ever watch. Those looking for deep world building, a sharply written script, or jam packed back to back action scenes will not find it here. But those hoping to relive their childhood for a couple hours, and maybe introduce their little on to it, might find a lot of heart and a silly fun time to be had.","

I won't write a long unnecessary review, just know I was never a Power Rangers fan and now I am most certainly thankful for that! Elizabeth Banks as always, she rocks! I love her. However, this was two hours completely wasted as 90% of the movie is us watching these teens discover their powers and themselves (sort of). There's barely any comedy and the last few minutes is just packed with uncomfortable action scenes and CGI. Watch if your bored....","

"FallenEye","22 January 2018","The story never needed to be unprecedented or filled with twists, it just needed to be a simple ""kids turning into superheroes and saving the world"", and I'm glad that that's exactly what they did, however still in taking that simple route, Power Rangers was missing texture and focus.That simple story with magnificent execution would've turned this movie all the way up, but Dean got lost in trying to draw emotion, create a connection, add humour and showcase spectacular action sequences, and frustratingly kept falling short every time.The sound mixing, sound editing and score were almost amateur, and the direction and cinematography (especially with the final battle) was, terrible really, and the combination of all I just mentioned created these awkward gaps throughout the movie.The beginning of the movie is pretty fun though. These kids who don't know each other from a bar of soap, discovering a new world and powers while living our childhood fantasy of heroism and secrecy... It really just needed to be that simple.It sucks that this film wasn't as good as it really could've been, especially because Power Rangers has all it needs to be an epic series. Perhaps if we're lucky, Lionsgate may want to give that sequel a shot, because our interest is still there, but they'll have to bring it twice, three times as hard this time around. 5.4/10.","

Rita repulse also returns but was once a rogue green power rangers who wants the zeo crystals as a way of gaining more power. She is also more evil and insane than she was in the TV series.

"michaelbaltazar-31857","30 September 2017","To me, I don't think that the new power rangers movie was all that bad because it is only the first movie which they have to introduce everybody for one and also they have to get all the newer viewers up to date with the older movies and last they want to also make it entertaining for the new generation. I'm only 19 and I hate to say it but this new generation isn't like the 90's. There are more kids know that are into this new behavior that you saw in the movie. For example with the cursing and dirty jokes and other things like that, is what kids now a days are into. I just graduated high school so I know a little of how the kids in this generation react to and what there into. I really think they should continue with the next seven movies if it actually comes to that many because know that the first movie with the introduction is over there may also be more action and more things that will make the series more popular with the next movies. I am a little interested in what they plan on doing with people that were in the original TV series and movies. For example Bulk and skull and others. Although, the movie may have been bad to other people to me it lived up to my expectations.","

"kermitkid","30 March 2020","To be honest, I got pretty much what I expected with this movie. I thought at best it would be average, and at worst it would be a dumpster fire, like ""Fant4stic"". And yeah, it was perfectly average. A lot could have been improved, changed, and taken out, but at the end of the day, I was entertained. I wasn't checking how much runtime was left, or praying for the sweet release of the end credits, but I wouldn't exactly recommend this film to anybody either. It's entertaining, but not exactly a film I'm clamoring to watch again. The film did suffer from a lot of problems. The chemistry between the 4 leads was awful. The runtime is 2 hours and 15 min, and for a movie called ""Power Rangers"" and it takes almost 2 hours of that for them to actually become the Power Rangers. Instead, they fill up the time with teen angst and drama. It felt like I was watching a Disney Channel movie or something on Freeform. There was one part where a character supposedly died, but I honestly didn't care because not enough time was spent on their character development. I was indifferent to what happened to these characters. Also, they hired Bryan Cranston, but just like in 2014's ""Godzilla,"" he's barely in it, and his talent is wasted. Bill Hader got more screentime. Bill Hader! I like Bill Hader, but in small incriments. He was in this wasy too much. By far, the best part of the movie was Elizabeth Banks' performance as the villain. She went over-the-top without overdoing it. Just a classic Saturday morning cartoon style villain who enjoys being evil for the sake of being evil. The first half of the movie did give me a sense of deja vu, as it felt a little too much like someone was trying to do a remake of ""Chronicle."" There are very few times where I praise the score of a movie, but I have to here. I loved the score. It sounded like the soundtrack to ""Tron: Legacy."" I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters, but it was worth a rent. If you're at Redbox, and this is in stock, and there's nothing else you want to see, it's worth at least one watch.

"shobanchittuprolu","24 September 2017","Power Rangers (2017): A whole generation of youngsters will never forget watching Power Rangers which has lot of iterations inspired stupid children everywhere to karate chop their friends and enemies. Naturally, it was only a matter of time before it was reconstituted into a feature film and inflicted upon the poor old unsuspecting world.But unfortunately, this reboot strains so hard to distance itself from the original TV series, it could spoil your childhood memories.Plot: High school outcasts Jason Scott/Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly/Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott), Billy/Blue Ranger (RJ Cyler), Zack/Black Ranger (Ludi Lin), Trini/Yellow Ranger (Becky G.) stumble upon an old alien ship, where they acquire superpowers and are dubbed the Power Rangers. Learning that an old enemy of the previous generation has returned to exact vengeance, the group must harness their powers and use them to work together and save the world.My Review: To go through everything wrong with Power Rangers will require more typing than there is time in the world. Its most unforgivable sin is that IT'S SO BORING.It really should not be that hard to inject life into a story about five high school kids with superpowers.Yet, it takes 90 minutes for the heroes to get suited up - which for anyone hoping to see a film about Power Rangers will not seem fair and to make it worse a theme song plays in background ""Go!Go!Power Rangers""(Should I have to go away and quit watching this?). Even then, they almost instantly get into their dinosaur-shaped Zord vehicles for the remainder of the film. That means we get to watch the actors reacting in cockpits. We watch them making ""Wow"" faces. What... a... thrill.And the major problem is that it seriously tries to impress adults by some crude remarks which are totally out-of-place and the movie was supposed to be PG.Well the female rangers' suits are worse – the whole focus of the women's costumes becomes their breasts (when the original didn't even have this sort of sexualisation).The only pro of this movie is its cast.The ace of the five is Cyler (eternally great in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl), who brings a manic energy and big heart to the picture as Billy. Even in such confused trash as this, he's a bonafide star.Others are also very good.So,Power Rangers really makes us question ""Who the heck asked for this crappy reboot""? My Rating 4.75/10","

"SyoKennex","7 January 2020","I was just going to leave a half funny comment on this and leave but I can't.First of All, Zordon being a dick? Bryan Cranston did an amazing job as Zordon but being a twat to the Rangers because he's grumpy about being locked up? That's not Zordon. That is everything Zordon is not.And Kimberly????? Kimberly is a kind hearted girl who would babysit disabled children, learned and taught sign language for her deaf cousin and taught kids gymnastics even when she was busy. Sure she can be a bit stuck up at times but Kimberly is NOT the type of girl to send someone's nudes around school? She's a very rarely sometimes sort of stuck up popular girl but she's NOT the kind of girl to do that? At all? She's the kind of girl who would defend whoever this happened to. She wouldn't ridicule someone like that.The suits??? What the hell was the suits???? They were using everyone's original suit designs so I don't get why they had to sci-fi/cyber them up? The original suits in slightly off colour (darker pink, lighter yellow, etc) would have worked just fine. Also why are their faces reveleased in the Zords? The Rangers never had their face on show incase of emergency, ie their zord got wrecked, leaving them without a helmet covering their face.
Also Kimberly's Zord burning and her struggling? It's been proven in numerous form of the PR universe that Zords have mechanics incase of this? It was a pathetic call back to Kimberly being a damsel in distress.Did the director see a single piece of the Power Rangers verse before this film? I see the way he was trying to go for this film but it fell massively flat.The 2 stars are for Ludi Lin and RJ Cyler, the original theme being used when they first the Zords, and for the Megazord not looking like crap.The fact this is some kids first ever viewing of the PR verse breaks my heart.","

"austin0731","30 March 2017","Power rangers is the modern rendition of the classic TV series of the same name and reimagines the cheesy franchise into a modern more serious version. It stars 5 teenagers, 'outsiders' and 'misfits' as they are joined together by fate and are tasked to become the 'Power Rangers' a superhero team tasked with protecting these 'Zeo crystals'.The movie really was building up to be a very well done and emotionally investing superhero origin story but everything really goes downhill after the team 'suits up' in its final act to battle the villain played by Elizabeth Banks, the evil Rita Repulsa hell bent on destroying this small town and eventually the world? So as I said, I really liked the first half of this film where we really get to sympathize with these characters, they were both likable and relatable, especially the blue ranger who I was really afraid would reel towards the annoying side, I am glad that it didn't go that way. The film had a more serious tone and had real emotional moments which I as one who has not seen the originals suspect was not a theme in the originals at all. This was all great and all and I really wished this trend had carried through the entire film. However once we are introduced to Rita Repulsa who acts as this over the top and ridiculous character the film starts to go down hill. The power rangers battle these golem things that she summons and that fight choreography is seriously flawed and uninspiring. You could argue that this was trying to stay true to the series' over the top cheesy aura but then why would you build up the first half to be such a more mature film?So to finalize, I must conclude that this is a pretty good attempt to revive the franchise and is a solid first film for potential sequels. I really enjoyed what they did in the first half of this film so I do hope that this is what they stick to in the future.","

The only one that can be attributed to it is that some characters, especially secondary ones, fall into the typical clichés of teen cinema.What prevents the film from being excellent is the terrible villain, because she overreacts that she borders on the ridiculous, the character has little development and her motivations are limited to the cliché of wanting to dominate the universe.","

"FelipeCarrillo","20 July 2017","It's clear that with the passing of the years our sphere is transfigured and our outlook on life is attached with the presented updates. The 1990s supposed a range of cinematographic parables and personalities with mere budgetary intentions, however, these products built infancy and youth of men and women with a mixture of eyewash and absurdity dressed up in laughable clothes. In simultaneous, these ones established the foundations of contemporary pop-culture by means of certain patterns and artistic commercial manifestations. Haim Saban created, set up and distributed a show intended for young audiences with the verbose title ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", a series based on the Japanese saga ""Super Sentai Series"" and won an incredible success not only in English speaking countries, but around the world, achieving the status of popular icon. Later, there were two more rounds of episodes and two audiovisual productions inciting the fervent appreciation for the the quintet of teens who fought in Japan but resided in the United States. Today, Dean Israelite presents the third in the franchise, which is an installment that feeds American leisure to create modernizations of films which generated a determined impact in past ages, only this time, curiously, the process is reversed: The 2017 graphics aren't the most important renovation in the story are the treatment and conception of the coming-of-age characters which stand out on screen, where action/adventure sequences, by which the most avid spectators attended movie theaters (adding a dose of pure nostalgia around the series and original film), are placed in the penultimate position in order of importance, anomalous statement keeping in mind Hollywood's cinematic predilections.First and foremost, the weight of transforming a visually cartoonish concept into an interesting and coherent plot falls on screenwriter John Gatins, undeniably. Gatins doesn't shake off giving stereotyped profiles to the leading roles, but he gets rid of showing them in a methodical and jerky way, he provides sketched characters to the indicated interpreters, in addition, keeps a surprising fidelity leaving intact the basic components. It's a shame that this fierce and warlike harmony of introduction isn't injected into all the feature film. The various situations that it inserts around the characters, which serve to reveal who or what they're, are known, but acceptable, and in certain instants are enjoyable such as the campfire scene or in which knacks of the young cast are evidenced, not in overblown effects or plot twists, circumstances where the soul is naked and the ears are wide open. Second, the film falls on the shoulders of Dean Israelite, not very frequented filmmaker to direct a blockbuster of that caliber, but he's an expert executing a carefree tone. Perhaps, Lionsgate made this signing as an incentive, in order to the director, provides part of tone and form of the story of travels through time to the idea. It's clear, Israelite doesn't possess the required acuity to express with panache and subtlety the key action sequences, therefore, he prioritizes the characters, which is an appropriate determination. However, when you're responsible for carrying out a mega-production, you must lead every minimum job with a successful tact. Abrupt pace changes in certain scenes, hand-held shots, and fast cuts make it intelligible and unenjoyable what should be enjoyable; the visual effects are decent and the new designs of the costumes, the Zords, and the Megazords aren't entirely bad.Last but not least, it's the heterogeneous casting. Israelite and his the crew took their time to find the favorable actors, and they found them. They opted, thank goodness, not to select a rubicund stereotyped woman or American husky heartthrob, the chosen ones are facing favorably unknown, unknown but with many talents to explore. Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Ludi Lin and Becky G. are officially the new Power Rangers, those that could be the popular icons of the post-millennium generation, although it's an uncertain future, with Marvel and DC monopolizing the sector at present.In addition to the newcomers and their laborious performances, it's only two great stars are meddled within the novice cast: Elizabeth Banks, trying to replace the new Teffie from ""The Hunger Games"" and Bryan Cranston, who runs a fascinating prolog but a bittersweet appearance on a wall.Everyone feared with what Dean Israelite could do, who could destroy a franchise and a pop icon in pieces with the fire of his ambitions or could expand the radar and get a handful of fans who support the invention of more adventures with Saban's team. The director is placed in the middle of the bifurcation. Visually, it doesn't take advantage of all its possibilities, being severely affected by the dizzying frenzied scenes, however, we can affirm that the area of characters is as well sketched as presented, successfully introduced, opening the door to a couple of doses more of Morphin' Time. With two unforgettable scenes and the interesting new Rangers, Dean Israeli's ""Power Ranges"" isn't the hollow popcorn movie we expected, however, it's not what we weren't looking forward to; a super production that falls in certain details with what failed in ""Fox's F4ntastic"" in 2015, but surprisingly gives the protagonism to those who really belong it, the heroes.","

"ttttony-18640","5 April 2018","I took my family to this (young kids who love the tv show), only to discover a wannabe teenage drama with 'themes' that tries way too hard. You can still have a good movie with teenagers as the main character without having all the 'Hollywood teenager' behaviour a of rebellion against parents, drinking, making dangerous decisions that get people killed and stripping down to your bra onscreen. Not everyone is a melodramatic whiner that has these Hollywood cliche problems. (He said after whining about the movie)All that aside, it took forever for the real power ranger action to happen. The movie was like; 1hr 45mins of teenage drama then finally some power ranger action which did not follow the same serious tone the rest of the movie had. They should've had a more lighthearted build up, allow the rangers to use their powers for lesser threats in a 'training sort of way' and then the big battle.","

"MrPupkin","3 December 2019","I grew up on Power Rangers, I always loved them, even as an adult I re-watch Mighty Morphin' about once a year. But it's never been ""good"", so for 2017's Hollywood go-over to even come across as well as it did is impressive, but still, in keeping with history, Power Rangers is not ""good"". And where it fails hardest is in its most Power-Ranger-iest moments. Before Rita Repulsa, and the Ranger suits and the quote unquote epic showdown at Krispy Kreme (which by the way is probably the most heinous example of product placement I've ever seen), I was actually pretty on board, sure the acting was hit and miss at best, but as characters I was interested to follow their dynamic. Unfortunately, this is at best half the film, and even this half isn't perfect.","

If you don't know what Ultraman is look it up its the same thing but in Japan. Saban's Power Rangers follows five ordinary teens who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove — and the world — is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so, they will have to overcome their real-life issues and before it's too late, band together as the Power Rangers. I was mainly watching this for the action and fight scenes which they're very little of in this movie. It does have a cool opening sequence with Rita killing the other rangers on some far away planet, I'd like too see that movie instead of this one it looked a lot more interesting than the actual movie itself. Jason is getting into trouble by stealing a cow(what the heck) and ends up in detention meets Billy, they find the ranger crystals with three other teenagers on the mountains Zach, Trixi and Kimberly. When they decide to go back because they become super strong after having been in a car crash they soon discover a spaceship underground where Alpha five voiced by Bill Hader is there to greet them. Zordon is awaken and tells that Rita Repulsa is coming to collect gold to build Goldon(I think it was called) and will destroy the earth. I liked some of the actors like Bill Hader as Alpha five was cool and Bryan Cranston but not the main squad. They just seemed forgettable the only memorable one is Trixi and that's just because she's played by Becky G who's just hot. I liked Elizabeth Banks costume and performance as Rita Repulsa, even if she was one dimensional as a villain I really didn't care. I don't know anything about Power Rangers except that was stupid cheesy and fun, this movie tries to be that but fails. I mean it should have been forty to fifty minutes in and see the suits and I mean all of them not just one but no we got wait through teenage bull that looks like Chronicle. I'm giving Power Rangers a 4 out of 10.","

Most people giving it bad reviews are those who have disdain for younger audiences or that just wanted an Transformes/Avengers-like movie with only fighting and no character development. I was amazed at how good the movie was, given I've read some reviews previous to go watching it. It is pretty solid, self-contained and with some references for hardcore fans to get. The focus of the movie is the kids and not their powers or shooting lasers and fighting for half of the movie. Unlike many of the same genre, it actually have proper character development and show us believable emotions. Great movie, overall.","

"recca01982","30 June 2017","I will be completely honest here. This movie,... I went into with little to no hope for. I've seen the trailers, seen the leaks and heard friends who saw it in theaters. This movie was garbage. Going into it expecting the awesome rangers I grew up with, was my own fault, I will freely admit that.But let's start it out with how they started the movie. Within the first five minutes there's an implied moment where a GENIUS of a friend to Jason ""milked"" a male ""cow"". Let's go ahead and ignore that the supposed leader of the power rangers was committing a crime. Then proceeds to follow up said crime by running from the cops in a twisting camera of nausea. He then avoids the police and gets into a car accident, and proceeds to blame the freaking world over his issues by,.... BEING ANGST FILLED.To be honest, around this time I wanted to turn it off. The acting was pretty poor in terms of quality, and the interactions if you could call it that, were few and far definitely meant only to try to make a sense of teamwork that wasn't there.I could go on and on to nit pick this whole movie apart with how poop filled it was. But I'll simply leave it with these points.Action 1.5/5 - Few and far between. There's maybe two action scenes,... one in the ""pit"" (a safe place for the teens to train against things that would otherwise KILL them), and the end of the movie where it's painful to even watch. The CG of this fight is cringe worthy for 2017, and their one liners are completely ridiculous.Comedy 1.5/5 - This movie tried to make humor in EVERY situation it could. Which lead to some seriously bad timing in terms of lead up. Such as fighting for the life of the universe. It was unnecessary considering it TRIED to make itself super dark in terms of the movie.Plot 2.5/5 - Typical plot, not good or bad, it's power rangers.Overall, a complete avoid. I'm kind of upset I paid $4 for this movie, and it isn't a rental so I can't get rid of it from my digital library.","

I love the twist, and the signs of positive diversity with switching around the races of the characters. Even with the ethnic background being switched, the actors did an amazing job bringing the same personality traits to that particular ranger.I give it a 7 out of 10 only because the excitement in me wished they would have started in on the action a bit sooner, but like I said, it was still entertaining at the most so there is no heavy complaint in my book.Looking forward to part two with us getting to meet the new green ranger.

"jephtha","8 July 2017","For those that knew it as their first big franchise, Power Rangers will always hold some appeal. I happen to fall into this camp. Though a lapsed fan at best and fully aware of the series' constant dismissal of conventional critical standards, it brings a distinct, Saturday morning feeling that perhaps we'd all like to rekindle on occasion. With numerous old properties being re-launched, and often being botched, it really is about time this one got a shot at the modern age. The result is the first worthwhile adaptation of its type in a long time, and perhaps a little more.It's important to keep in mind that this film was made primarily for those at least passingly familiar with the series. I don't see it drawing in too many new, serious-minded followers; it won't serve as the crown-pleasing introduction that Star Trek (2009) was. But this should in no way denounce what the movie has accomplished. Admittedly, there are many bothersome things scattered throughout. I'm not a fan of Dean Isrealite's semi-hand-held camera-work and multiple plot elements don't add up, but these things don't significantly mar the proceedings. Compared to the stuff in the original series, this is a notable step in the right direction.In addition to providing recognizable new iterations of old faces, ""Power Rangers"" shows effort in bringing substance and dimension to its key players and a distinct visual flair for its fantastical elements. For a film tasked with establishing five key players, it does a commendable job of distinguishing each one, and the cast infuses them with more than enough humanity to keep us engaged; redefining them as misfits and screw-ups was an inspired decision. The story of how they become heroes is fraught with clichés and conventions of the superhero genre, but the good news is that this is one of the better applications of the formula. The team building segments are better than those from ""The Avengers"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", possibly because the group is actively working towards a goal rather than just waiting around for the big push at the end. Simple actions like speedily passing notes during detention or sparring over the last café pastry add much.There seemed to be much fuss over the film's take on Rita. While Elizabeth Banks does go over-the-top in some scenes and there are multiple hints at a backstory that is never explored, the villainess serves her purpose adequately. She lacks substance, but she's intimidating and formidable, two qualities that the original version of the character badly needed. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed Bill Hader's take on Alpha 5. While the robot's new CGI look is not very appealing, has some genuinely funny lines, and even delivers some brief action. Bryan Cranston provides a suitably sullener take on Zordon, though his voice is a little too recognizable.Action is mostly limited to the final half-hour or so, which may understandably irk some viewers. The ground combat sequence with the Rangers taking on the golem-like putties includes a cool skirmish through a suspended lake, but leaves one wishing for more. Initially, I found the designs for the Zords to be off-putting, but I've gotten used to them, and actually found the scenes of them in action to be more enjoyable on repeat viewings. However, those machine-gun weapons are uninspired. As for the suits, they've got a nice alien quality, particularly from those galaxy-like displays and lights. Angel Grove provides an unusually small backdrop for the climax, but this was probably a conscious decision to avoid collateral damage based criticisms. Regardless, the sequel needs a bigger setting. That's where these types of characters can truly thrive.This is a time of franchise reboots and resurgences. While that's often not the best thing, it's always exciting to see the return of a beloved property. For the longest time, projects such as ""Digimon Adventure Tri"" seemed like an impossibility, and certainly no one expected another Power Rangers feature. This upgrade leaves me optimistic for once.","

"thepriceofpayne","17 June 2018","Power Rangers is already a tough film for me to review, see I grew up on the Power Rangers and have always been a HUGE fan. Thanks to Power Rangers I was introduced to many comic book characters, which in turn introduced me to comic book films, which in turn introduced me to Film in its own right, so I've got a lengthy history. Also when I say I grew up on Power Rangers, I didn't grow up on one particular incarnation, thanks to cousins and brothers who grew up in the 90s I had tapes and DVDs of almost every season of Power Rangers. One of my favorites being the original of course. So going into this film I had seen the entire original series as a kid as well as all of its other incarnations. That said this is a good film. To begin the Performances are fantastic the entire group of Rangers give some well rounded three dimensional characters even more depth, which brought me a lot of surprises. The film has since had me following the careers of Montgomery, Cyler, Scott, Gomez, and Lin and they've just continued to evolve as actors. Next the suit designs are great and the action/visuals are great as well. Thanks to a nice story and Israelites direction. However that doesn't excuse other moments. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks are fantastic actors, but Cranston is just given exposition lines and Banks is acting like she's in another film completely. Also the film didn't really mix the strong character moments well with the Power Rangers moments. It's like you need to watch the film as two halves not one whole. There are moments where the dialogue is off and the soundtrack (while good) distracts from the film, and it's very nice score. All in all the film has much more heart and love than the Ninja Turtles and Transformers films, but you can tell someone just wasn't too sure of the direction, and with the origin story it's harder to delve into greater moments. I personally love the film and hope it garners a sequel, but I can see why someone wouldn't like it that much. Especially some of the original fans, a die-hard ranger fan such as myself might like it more due to the many incarnations of Power Rangers, but for people who grew up on the Classic MMPR series, you may have a harder time. But if you look past nostalgia you'll find a fun Power Rangers film.","

Even if you are new to the series, this movie could give you an idea of what i'm talking about.","

"zordmaker","25 March 2017","OK. First lets set the stage. I worked on the first (1995) Power Rangers movie, creating the zords and a fair bit of the art department wizardry. Power Rangers goes back a long way for me, having not just been a mad fan of the show but also having been given the opportunity to shape and mould that PR universe of long ago.So it was indeed with apprehension that I entered a darkened theater 22 years later to sit and watch what they have now done to our little baby that started it all. Along with my 13 year old daughter who'se name is unashamedly Kimberley.Right away the opening scene had me hooked. This film is very much a complete re imagining of the concept from scratch. It has little to do with the past. It's dark and gritty.. but not too dark and gritty. It goes to great lengths to explain character back story which is something most MMPR fans would know featured as a glaring absence in previous work with this property.There were a lot of our original rules that this film breaks. Initially I feared this would doom Power Rangers, as it has done many other superhero film ""reboots"" of late who chose not to stay faithful to original concepts and designs.Our rule about not seeing the face of morphed rangers - broken. But in it's place, finally.. an explanation as to what ""being a Ranger"" really IS all about.This film is daring in design. It will delight ALL traditional fans AND new viewers. In many ways this is the Power Rangers film we always wished we could have made back in 1995 had we been given the chance or the time.This film works. It makes sense. Before long I stopped caring about the differences between new and old and became immersed in this 21st century version. Yes Alpha looks terrible - but sounds fantastic. And yes, the 21st Century rangers DO look much better than our 20th century attempts.Yes I had to pinch myself a few times when the third act played out almost exactly the same way as our original did.""Power Rangers"" is a great film for today. It stands on it's own feet. I am happy to see that Junior has finally grown up. Anyone who knows me will tell you I'm a hard nut to crack, especially when it comes to something as close to me as Power Rangers.However this film cracks that nut with ease. It sets us up for multiple sequel opportunities and no doubt will spawn a new found interest both in new and old by most who see it. There's some genuinely new concepts in there and finally, some respect for the strong characters that captured so many fans of the original both young and old.The only thing missing from this film is (perhaps) more of the morphed Rangers, which we don't see until the third act begins. The villain (Rita) is perhaps a little too dark and no match for Paul Freeman's delightful and witty ""Ivan Ooze"" in our original. Her minions (affectionately known as putties) are little more than copies of our own ""rock creatures"" from 1995 and really not much of a match for the new Rangers.The opening scene (set in the distant past) clearly show both Zordon and Rita are naked after their armor is released and yet for the Rangers we still see the armor built over the top of their street clothes. It's a shame this mystery of the ""morphing process"" built into the opening scene couldn't be extended into the all important creation of the new rangers a millennia or so later.Ultimately and despite the radical departure from our original designs, I enjoyed this Power Rangers reboot, as did ""Kimberley"". I find my old ""ranger fandom"" given a new boost of energy in this version and look forward to the next chapter in the MMPR story.And finally, I sit satisfied that the new film dared not to create a new Megazord Cockpit, choosing instead to leave the rangers in their own zord cockpits when the giant is formed.I guess they just can't improve on perfection, eh?","

"dawn-353","28 June 2018","I remember watching the original as a kid and I really enjoyed this film. It was great to see what they did with the modern version of this story. I also liked how the got a diverse cast and were able to still make it about friendship and teamwork in the end. I hope the sequel is good or even better because I think there is a lot with the storyline that they can do with it.","

"liam_nb","7 April 2020","If your expectations are low you'll probably enjoy this movie as a standard action flick with decent characterization but if I took a deep dive into why i think it doesn't live up to the Power Rangers name it would of course be the fact it tried to be way too dark in some parts and Elizabeth Banks terrible villain also the cuttaway everytime she does something I know why they did it but at the same time it's a practice in movies I hate, basically this movie tried to modernize power rangers and do a marvel approach to it it still had some of that classic ridiculousness but not enough to get a 10/10 so if your a fan if say your more likely to hate this if you've never seen power rangers this will probably be alright for you.
The only good change though is not making the black ranger black and yellow ranger Asian cos that was so weird in the original show bordering on offensive.","

"Randomgirl111","9 July 2021","I'm gonna get the best thing about this film out of the way first and why the rating isn't any lower (since this character was quite prominent): the autism representation! As an aspie myself, I applaud the writers for actually creating such a likeable character that I could connect myself to. Unlike other representations, Billy (the aspie) isn't one-dimensional. The writers actually realised that autism is a mental condition, NOT a personality trait. Yes, Billy is autistic. But that doesn't mean he lacks empathy, courage, maturity, patience or teamwork skills. Autism also doesn't stop him from being a power ranger. What makes Billy a really believable representation of autism to me is, unlike Music where Sia used autism as an excuse to not develop Music's character and personality, Billy's autism gave him not just some of the challenges of autism (difficulty in understanding sarcasm and jokes, repetitive behaviour, lack of social skills) but also some of the positives of autism (high intellect, great imagination, he's brilliant at the hobbies he's into, like making gadgets and adjusting them etc) but he also has other traits which show that, even if autism is part of who he is, it doesn't make up 100% of who he is. Traits include: great mediator, great team player, great team leader (why wasn't he the red ranger), great friend, passionate about superheroes, completely selfless, curious, super epic fighter, caring and so on. Billy is literally not just my new favourite aspie in any type of media. But he's also one of the most likeable and well written characters I've seen in the last 10 years. I can literally see him a role model for aspies to either look up to or relate to. I would say that every other character in the movie was kinda dull. I honestly think 98% of the time, Billy was carrying the all of the heart or the movie. This brings us to one problem I had while watching this film: the rest of the main cast. Why? Because the rest of the main cast are either unlikable, stupid, bland or all of the above. And no. Then quickly explaining their sob stories does not give them any depth. Yes, Billy's dad died but he had a likeable personality and layers to his character. No other character has that. The rest of the cast is so unremarkable that I've already forgotten their names. The red power ranger is an idiot who does reckless, stupid stuff without a reason (e.g. Steals a cow, crashes a car), is angsty with his dad (who is rightfully upset with him) for no reason at all and is overly aggressive for, again, no reason, the yellow and pink rangers are just bland and under-developed and the black power ranger is so annoying, stupid and stubborn (in a bad way) that I wanted to knock some sense into him by punching his smug face. Like, why did he hop into the obviously dangerous-looking, enormous, robotic dino when he knew he was still training to be a ranger? I was also kinda disappointed that the power rangers didn't get their armour and stuff until the finale of the film. Luckily, there are still good things about the film, besides Billy, that made it engaging enough for me to keep watching. I'll admit the suits themselves (apart from the out of place mouth pieces), the effects, the action, the zoids were cool though. I also think the story structure itself was executed quite well and engaging to watch, the humour was funny, the cheesy tone was true to the original tv shows, the villian is entertaining and threatening, and the acting was fantastic. Anyway, yes, this film has flaws and it's lack of fan service might be a little disappointing to a lot of power rangers fans. But I definitely cannot call this a bad one. If you're looking for a decent action film with a good amount of cheesiness, you'll probably like this film. And I would especially recommend it to aspies, if they need a cool one to relate to and look up to. I seriously think this film would be 10 stars to me if Billy was the main character. But as it is, it's fine.","

"JimmyTeller","23 March 2017","Power Rangers succeeds as a film that actually cares about character building, unlike the typical Transformers movie that throws you right in the middle of numbing explosions and special effects, or getting too caught up in it's lore. It is never easy to make a character driven movie for an ensemble cast, but director Dean Israelite chose to gamble a majority of the runtime on fleshing out the characters, and it pays off. We are in turn rewarded with an effective, even if somewhat flawed storyline that warms us up to the heroes and allows us to establish an emotional connection with them, from their struggles to their triumph. And the film's climax, non-stop action backed with great music, becomes a hugely rewarding payoff.Israelite, a professed fan of the series, really does get it. He uses reliable tropes of a coming of age, underdog story, and litters the film with the right amount of nostalgia and cheesiness, in all the right places. The film is ultimately funny, nostalgic and uplifting, even if predictable. Fans of the series, watch it with your friends and go in expecting nothing. You just might be overwhelmed as I was.","

"PotterHead-7","28 July 2020","The cast tries and the ending had some fun and wacky moments. But its about 10-15 minutes too long. There is patchy CGI. The colour palette is dark for majority of the film. It takes way too long for the characters to morph. And boring for long stretches of the runtime. I wanted the film to be campy, funny and action packed.","

"nickijjohnson","25 May 2017","Frankly I find it hilarious that this movie is getting such bad reviews. I didn't think it was any worse than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remake though I hated that remake because I loved the original so I suppose I could understand how die hard Power Ranger fans may have not liked it. I watched the show when I was little and I have to say quite frankly it was the updated version of the same crap to me. It was a little more Breakfast Club than the TV show was. In fact when I first saw the trailer I thought it was going to be a remake for The Breakfast Club. I've also read reviews with people complaining about the acting which I find even more hilarious because the acting in the TV show was so over the top overacting that I found the movie's actors to be the toned down versions. Even the over- acting of Elizabeth Banks was nothing compared to the actor who played her in the TV show. In the end when they all synced up is when it really reminded me of the show. It's unfortunate though that there's already been Transformers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because it comes off as a wannabe even though none of these movies are original. They're just regurgitated shadows of their former selves. Next up is Baywatch. Why don't they just do I Love Lucy while they're at it? Anyway entertaining enough and to me just the updated version. A more pleasant blast from the past than that Ninja Turtle or Ghostbusters crap.","

"AaronDSimpson","3 July 2017","It has been a long time coming in contemporary film, but we've finally arrived at a point where directors no longer feel the need to cast baby-faced thirty-somethings as high-schoolers. Despite concerns from producers over the decades that younger actors are less experienced and might not act as well as their older counterparts, it seems that someone in Hollywood has realised that they aren't convincing us that any of them are under thirty-five. Power Rangers, however, boasts an average age of twenty four and, even then, it is only Black Ranger, Ludi Lin, throwing off the statistics at age thirty-three. If there is nothing else about this film that you could take away and tell your friends, at least you've got young-adult acting done by those that know it best.Often when films are remade and franchises are revived it can turn out badly for the original, as Clash of the Titans (2010) and Carrie (2003) can attest. Yet, in other occasions it can turn out brilliantly and revive latent passions and childhood excitement, such as with Rise of... and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2011 and 2014 respectively - ignoring, of course, Tim Burton's hash in 2001. Going into Power Rangers, knowing the thin line between failure and success and looking forward to reliving the experience of Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (1997) and Might Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie (1995), I found the reboot to be the perfect blend of cheese and modernisation. After all, it is a great strength of a remake to honour the legacy that precedes it whilst taking the franchise forward into a relevant direction.The rangers; Jason, Kimberly, Billy, Zack, and Trini meet one another during detention where each of them are revealed to be troubled and, partly, misunderstood teens. Red Ranger, Jason, has ruined his chances of a football scholarship when a prank involving the school's mascot goes wrong. Blue Ranger, Billy, is struggling with Autism after the death of his father, and the Yellow Ranger, Trini, struggles with sexuality and identity under the pressures of her normative family. The majority of the film is spent nurturing their character arcs and developing, what appears to be, an origin story for the rangers. Whilst dynamic characters are always cherished in films, it is slightly to the film's discredit that this process takes so long as action scenes are rushed into the ending almost as if Israelite were trying to fill Saban's quota of heroism. That being said, the interpersonal relationships that dominate the early parts of the film are what make it unrecognisable from a Power Rangers movie and this isn't entirely a detriment. There are no cringe-worthy martial arts, power stances, or badly sewn costumes, instead - meeting with the new requirements for superheroes - five regular kids that stumble across their powers. Whilst Billy is messing around in the gold quarry, a detonation goes wrong and the explosion reveals an alien rock from which Zack extracts the power 'coins' whilst attempting to find something valuable.After meeting Alpha-5 (Hader), a robot much like B.E.N. from Treasure Planet (2002) in both mannerism and appearance, and a digitised Zordon (Cranston) beneath the quarry in an episode of upside-down water reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), the pace of the film quickly increases. The transition from rangers who were struggling to morph and couldn't defeat the simulated soldiers in training were suddenly fully-suited and riding Zords into Angel Grove to defeat Goldar. All of the success in creating a modern and respectable Power Rangers, impervious to instant dating is slightly reduced at the appearance of Rita Repulsa (Banks), who's make-up is an insult to make-up artists everywhere. You might argue that her static character, simplistic villainy, and antiquated costume is an aspect of the original that demands a place in the remake, her character is something of an eye-sore compared to the refreshing rangers. Considering the lengths gone to humanise the rangers and, to some extent, Zordon, it is disappointing that Repulsa has been neglected in this respect. The reality is that her only saving grace is her unawareness of Krispy Kreme - a brand that appears so centrally you might wonder about their contribution to the production - which offers a cheap comic thrill throughout.The crowning moment of the film, and the final nod to the original, is during the action sequence where the rangers are racing in their Zords back to Angel Grove and the original theme tune occupies the channels. For some, this is an act of unforgivable cringe but, for me, I was privately filled with child-like wonder and an overwhelming wish that I could be a power ranger - Any of the colours would have done in that moment. Even the 'boss fight' between the Rita/Goldar hybrid and the Megazord did not compare. The process of the Zords becoming the Megazord a little too similar to Transformers, which Israelite must of realised considering the Easter egg which features Bumblebee parked in the street during the battle.The film can be considered a success for the hardcore fan-base of the Power Rangers series as it does a commendable job of modernising the franchise and making it relevant to a new audience. However, for new viewers, there are going to be moments of confusion as to whether you're watching The Avengers, or Transformers and poses the threat of being a flash-in-the-pan, definitely entertaining during the two hours you're watching it, but not something that you're going to remember the details of two weeks later.Despite institutions like Forbes reporting that a sequel is unlikely, the plot has been engineered with a follow-up in mind.

"crsimons14","2 January 2019","This is not a masterpiece or an Oscar worthy piece of filmmaking. It is what it was meant to be. A retelling of a 90s era mega hit for all ages. Cheesy at times. Perhaps a little slow for children. A couple of the rangers seemed to be out of place (Black and Yellow) but all in all this was an entertaining reboot for anybody who was a fan of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers. The movie achieves its number one goal in my opinion. It's actually entertaining. For a Power Ranger Reboot that was good enough for me.",NA

"puertorricanhealingtouch","2 September 2019","Listen people, first of all, this movie is the best power ranger movie out there! If you're stuck in the 90's version of it, snap the hell out of if, this movie is not for you only, it actually has elements of the old and the new stuff. It is NOT sexualized like someone said, just like the power rangers, it deal with real life situation and how to over come them, in a more modern way, so get over your old mentality self, and yes! I adore the 90's power rangers, I grew up with them.It is sad that people review a movie and make it sound so bad, because it doesn't suit their ego. That's just bad reviewing, get a grip, and stop living in the past.As for the second part, I'm looking forward to it coming out!Rita looks SUPER AWESOME in this movie! And the Goldar, it is awesome. But my favorite part is the armors and the megazor, hot damn! That was super cool",NA
"Brevin_Campbell","29 March 2017","I have been very worried about Power Rangers ever since the press release came out. While I was looking forward to it I wasn't sure how dark or cheesy it would be. But what I didn't expect was it to be a little bit of both. The Power Rangers movie is a cool and fun with its plot and has a lot diversity in its cast. Everyone here seems to be having a good time in some way. The film doesn't have many big name stars in it and yet still finds away to be successful. Why Power Rangers hasn't been the critical hit that critics wanted and the box off juggernaut the studio needed it still was fun and that is all you can really ask for with these types of films. If I were to give a negative it would be Rita Repulsa. She seems to be in a different movie entirely as while all the other actors feel a bit grounded her character feels completely over the top to the point where it is almost laughable. She simply doesn't seem to have the charisma and the groundedness to fit in this slightly darker world they have built.That not to say Power Rangers itself is really that dark. It has many darker elements within it and it does go further than the show, but I would say its about as dark as Hunger Games of Divergent. The film feels very much like a teen film made for the same demographics that went to see Twilight, Hunger Games and others. But unlike those films it not afraid to have a little bit of fun with itself. Overall Power Rangers is a film I would highly recommend people to check out.",NA
"j_costa1985","18 June 2017","First I have to counter all the reviews complaining about how this movie is ""not made for kids"". 1.) Its a PG-13 rated movie (not PG) 2.) I saw it with my 8 year old, and didn't find anything wrong with it at all (especially since any of the dumb things the kids did in the movie resulted in actual consequences, so it can be great for teaching your kids life lessons). Unlike all the other movies (even PG ones) where kids do things they shouldn't and get away with it. 3.) The target audience is those of us who grew up with the power rangers (upper 25-40 year olds). Now for MY review: I'm a true rangers fan, even have all their signatures from comicons. THIS is seriously my new favorite movie! It was the most realistic movie so far out of any and all ""super hero"" type movies (they messed up a LOT, first mission was an epic failure, High school kids doing stupid crap actually resulted in REAL consequences...). I also enjoyed that they didn't sexualize the teens, or throw in unnecessary relationships or stupid crap.They didn't white-wash the characters (casting was PERFECT), and even added an LGBT and autistic character into the main crew without it being the focus or a limitation or some political commentary, they just were (OMG! wait for it) NORMAL PEOPLE!! THANK YOU!!It stayed true to the original rangers, but I loved that they modernized it (otherwise it really would have been super cheesy and terrible) and they gave it something new. The effects were AMAZING! I also LOVED the throwbacks they threw in there, so cool! When they said ""it's morphing time"" and later when the original music started playing I was dying! The 90s kid in me was nerdgasaming everywhere Dude seriously! I already want to watch it again *drool*THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING and anyone with anything bad to say is probably just some overly conservative jerk who is butthurt by the characters realistic life challenges and diversity.",NA
"zombiefan89","27 April 2018","I'm going to check spoilers, but there's honestly not much to ""spoil"". You've seen this story before. And if you've followed the other seasons of Power Rangers, you've seen this story done to death!
Five Teenagers become Super Heroes and fight a Giant Monster while riding in a Humanoid Giant Robot, which is made up of Five Smaller, usually animal themed, Robots. That's Power Rangers. It's cheesy. It's campy. It's nostalgic fun.
This movie is banking on you being familiar with the franchise.
(Pros: )
I liked the teenagers. Their acting was pretty good. Trini was quite underdeveloped though. I liked that Rita was the Green Ranger, and Zordon was the Red Ranger. It makes sense that Rita COULD kill everyone. The original Green Ranger was always the Strongest/Best Ranger. In the 90s TV show, the Green Ranger leaps into the Megazord and kicks all the other Rangers out of it.
(Cons:)
The zords and ranger suits are hideous. I do not see those toys selling well at all. They look like Transformers meets Iron Man.",NA
