"Bridge of Spies","subxerogravity","18 October 2015","This movie hit me really strangely.I was expecting a political drama about the cold war, and while indeed it was that, I was not expecting to have so much fun and for Bridge of Spies to be so humorous. The Coen brothers writing a movie Steven Spielberg would direct just sounds like a winning combination and it really was. Sealing the deal, was a great performance by Tom Hanks.Tom Hanks does what he does best, by playing an everyday man in an average life. James Donovan was just an insurance lawyer who gets caught up in the middle of the Cold War. Bridge of Spies, starts him off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure.And I do mean adventure. In the hands of Spielberg, the movie's visuals were large and epic. I was expecting this movie to feel more like his last flick, Lincoln. Instead it feels more like Indiana Jones, as James Donovan travels to Berlin at the time when the wall was being completed. Watching Hanks play Donovan who is just swept into an overwhelming situation and just keeps his cool and his charm is just highly enjoyable. Totally loved Bridge of Spies, It's one of the best team ups between Hanks and Spielberg and even though Lincoln was a great movie, Bridge of Spies is everything Spielberg is capable of. So entertaining.","

"Bridge of Spies","bob-the-movie-man","29 November 2015","There are combinations of film makers that make you confident, as you pay your ticket price, that you are not going to be terribly disappointed: Steven Spielberg directing; Tom Hanks taking the lead; Janusz Kaminski behind the camera; Michael Kahn editing and a Coen brothers script (with Matt Charmon (Suite Française)). And Bridge of Spies doesn't disappoint, particularly for someone of my more advanced years (I was born the year following the film's climatic events) who remembers well the terror of potential nuclear catastrophe that hung over the world through the 60's and 70's.In a story based on true events, Hanks plays James Donovan (diverging somewhat from reality here) as an insurance lawyer dragged by his firm into defending Rudolf Abel, the accused Soviet spy played exquisitely by British stage acting legend Mark Rylance. Against this backdrop, the international blue touch paper is about to be lit by the shooting down over Russia of Gary Powers (Austin Stowell from ""Whiplash"") in his U-2 spy plane (sorry – ""article""). Donovan becomes instrumental in unofficially negotiating on behalf of the US government the release of Powers in East Berlin. The deal is jeopardized by his boy-scout tendencies to also want to help another US captive Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers).I've read some negative reviews of this film in the papers that made me quite cross, describing it as ""yawnsome"" and ""sanctimoniously dull"". For me, nothing could be further from the truth and the packed Saturday night audience I saw this with seemed equally gripped from beginning to end, silent save for the odd laugh where some appropriate humor is weaved into the story.Tom Hanks is solid and believable as the fish-out-of-water lawyer, albeit that the role is played with a large spoonful of patriotic American sugar as Donovan trumpets about the importance of the constitution over the lynch-mob mentality of the general public. Alan Alda – great to see again on the big screen – channels his best Hawkeye-style exasperation as Donovan's boss, looking for a clean and quick conviction.But it is Mark Rylance – an irregular player in movies, and due to appear again in next year's ""BFG"" – who shines out as the acting star of the film. His salubrious and calm turn as the cornered spy just reeks of class and if he isn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this then there is no justice. (A special 'casting recognition award' to my wife Sue for spotting that the actress playing Judge Byer's wife – Le Clanché du Rand – was Meg Ryan's mother in Sleepless in Seattle 22 years ago!) The cinematography is superb with some gorgeous tracking shots and framed scenes. Most outstanding of all is the scene depicting the traumatic construction of the Berlin wall – long tracking shots in greys and blues delivering a truly breathtaking piece of cinema. In general I'd give a big shout-out to both the art department and the special effects team in making the desolation of East Berlin feel so real. It makes the similar scenes, that I commented positively on in the recent ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" seem like an amateur school production.The special effects team also contribute in making the shooting down of the U-2 a thrilling piece of cinema.Music is sparingly and effectively used by Thomas Newman, and it can be no greater complement to the composer than that I was wondering until the end titles as to whether it was another Spielberg/ John Williams collaboration or not.A great film, one of my favorites this year. Highly recommended, especially if you are over 50. You should also get out to a cinema to see this one – it will be far more effective on the big screen than the small one.(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

"Bridge of Spies","hoxjennifer","18 October 2015","Don't be fooled by the title. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you watch this film. Bridge of Spies is literally about the Cold War Bridge of Spies, where Soviet/US spies were exchanged through negotiations. This is nothing like ""The Americans"" (FX TV drama - for some high unrealistic and over-sexualized espionage action - redirect here) and the most action-packed scene you will see is Francis Gary Powers getting shot out of his U2 plane during his mission. Bridge of Spies is really a historical/legal drama. And based on my preliminary research, they seem to be getting most of their facts right. Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. There is a lot of talking, but it's meaningful talking. At times, the film can be a little slow {opening scene, especially}, but give it a chance and you might enjoy it. History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it. But thrill-seekers, you're better off to see the new James Bond movie instead.","

"Bridge of Spies","MrDHWong","28 October 2015","Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks, co-written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Steven Spielberg. Even though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I know very little about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than ever to learn more about it. I rank it among the best of Spielberg's most recent movies.In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war, Abel for Powers.Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another memorable performance as James B. Donovan, once again proving his versatility as an actor.I rate it 8.5/10.","

"Bridge of Spies","Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 February 2016","Following ""War Horse"" and ""Lincoln,"" ""Bridge of Spies"" rounds out Steven Spielberg's trilogy of histories in the 2010s, each film earning a Best Picture nomination for being a superb piece of craft — and having Spielberg's name attached.None of these are bad, but they are extremely traditional films evoking the prestige dramas of the '90s and not necessarily offering anything new. As such, ""Bridge of Spies"" doesn't shed new light on Cold War history, but it does tell a small story with of inspirational characters with a lot of heart.Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, an insurance attorney asked to represent a recently detained Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A proud Constitutionalist of sorts, Donovan decides it's his honor and duty to give one of America's most hated men his right to a defense. Then, when a U.S. pilot is captured in Soviet territory, the CIA recruits Donovan to negotiate a swap. ""Bridge of Spies"" echoes ""Lincoln"" in its portrayal of a morally tenacious man who stood firm in the face of opposition. Putting an actor as likable Hanks in the role of someone as upstanding and charming as Donovan is almost unfair. The script, treated by Mark Charman and also the Coen brothers, builds clever scenes for Hanks to navigate through with total ease. The story doesn't push or challenge the veteran, but it does frame everything that's happening with the appropriate weight, enough so that we can connect with everything Donovan is going through and respect the decisions he makes and Hanks helps communicate those stakes. The Cold War was an ugly time; it might seem that what Donovan did and how he approached his responsibilities was a moral no-brainer, but it was actually quite complicated and extremely unpopular.Rylance as well is a an excellent stroke of casting genius. More known for his stage work, the veteran creates a portrait of a man so self-assured it's frightening. It's the kind of nuanced supporting role that is easy to overlook when most award-winning supporting turns are flashy scene-stealers.Spielberg and longtime director of photography Janusz Kaminski give ""Bridge of Spies"" such richness. This is a film driven by plot and acting, but the picture is pristine. In particular, the way they capture East Berlin during the negotiations scenes is feels haunting in a way few films taking place in that similar time and place have. Also, the visual symbolism of reflections and different perspectives is something Spielberg plays with subtly but enough so to put some artistic flourishes on his film. Most importantly, the climactic bridge sequence works on every level, and that alone proves Spielberg, cast and crew all did their job.When Spielberg is done directing, ""Bridge of Spies"" will probably not make anyone's list of his top films, but it shows that just about any corner of history can make for an excellent film in capable hands.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Bridge of Spies","JohnDeSando","19 October 2015","""Everyone deserves a defense. Everyone matters."" James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks)In Bridge of Spies, Steven Spielberg once again masterfully goes to the historical drama with a righteous man's theme (think Schindler and Lincoln for starters). This time lawyer James B. Donovan is asked to defend an accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Able (Mark Rylance, superb), in order to show the world the American justice system is democratic. The story is ""inspired by true events"" with the outline of the exchange of Able for U-2 downed pilot Gary Powers historically accurate. As usual, Spielberg recreates the times with the atmosphere, cars, and film noir aspect of a spy thriller in the figurative and literal Cold War. He said, ""I always wanted to tell the stories that really interested me in my personal life—which are stories about things that actually happened.""Hanks is central to Spielberg's vision of the lone hero defying the odds and supporting the highest ideals of the American Constitution and the individually virtuous man. Never does Hanks overplay the good-guy card; he's just very adept at playing an everyman not always right but always righteous. The dialogue is crisp, a no fooling around typical of Spielberg and Hanks but a charming bad guy as well: James Donovan: ""Aren't you worried?"" Rudolf Abel: ""Would it help?"" As producer Kristie Macosko Krieger commented about Spielberg, ""He's got a childlike sense of wonder. He never gets tired of hearing stories . . . . "" Bridge of Spies is vintage Spielberg with a Lincoln-like atmosphere, righteous hero, and intriguing multi-plot, an entertaining spy story brimming with humanity. As the director says, ""This is more about very smart people in conversation with each other, and the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads is that, if they make the wrong decisions, it's the end of the world.""","

"Bridge of Spies","Quinoa1984","8 October 2015","One of the surprising things about Bridge of Spies is not really that Steven Spielberg directed this story, which tracks the trial and then trade of a Russian spy in 1957 (an exchange for an American pilot, and someone else who I'll get to shortly). It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.It's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).The Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.In a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.Bridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice (""Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters"" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.Two little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.Aside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","

"Bridge of Spies","erkucz00","9 April 2016","Bridge of spies is not your typical movie, it almost seems like it would be boring, except it isn't. This film is like a tree that you drive by on your way to work. Nothing special, quite ordinary; and then one day you see it from a different angle, and the way the dew glistening off of its leaves catches the sunlight, just takes your breath away. As I mentioned before, bridge of spies is different, it doesn't have a particularly memorable score, or poetic dialogue, every character is portrayed as a ""regular guy/gal"". The credit must go to the Coen brothers here. The actors lines, particularly the exchanges between Hanks' and Rylance's characters are stirring in their simplicity. The story unfolds similarly, everything sort of just happens, and at the end, it all fits together perfectly.Nobody knows, what makes Spielberg so great, is it his groundbreaking camera work? or perhaps his implementation of cutting edge visual effects? In my humble opinion it is his enigmatic ability to take what would likely be dull and uninteresting in the hands of any other director, and turn it into a thing of wonder. This movie plays out naturally, with moments of subtle heroism, and true human emotion, it is so very downplayed, that one simply cannot pull their eyes away. Bridge of Spies is truly an Organic Wonder.","

"Bridge of Spies","Turfseer","3 November 2015","What motivated Steven Spielberg to go ahead and take on a project such as ""Bridge of Spies?"" I've read that it was simply his nostalgia for the Cold War era, firmly ensconced in his childhood memories. Unfortunately, the vehicle to tell that story—the combined tale of the capture and trial of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel and swap for the downed US pilot Gary Powers on Russian soil—packs little punch due to its obvious lack of suspense.The ""Bridge of Spies"" narrative can be easily summarized in a short paragraph: the US government unofficially conscripts insurance lawyer James Donovan to defend Soviet spy Abel after he's captured by the Feds in Brooklyn. The trial is a foregone conclusion but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence Abel to prison instead of death since he could be used in a prisoner exchange in the future. Sure enough, after Gary Powers is shot down in his U2 spy plane, Donovan is again called upon to negotiate a prisoner swap with the Russians. A wrench is thrown into the negotiations when a US graduate student is arrested as a spy by the East Germans. Donovan deftly negotiates the swap of Abel for both Powers and the American student, and the exchange is facilitated with little incident.As historical incidents related to the Cold War go, the Abel-Powers narrative is hardly one of high drama. A major problem is that Donovan has no single, strong antagonist to play off of. The negotiations with his Soviet counterpart, a KGB agent masquerading as a diplomat, are a forgone conclusion. We know of course that the spy swap will be successful, so where is the suspense? The ""heart-pounding"" moment is hardly heart pounding at all—as Abel and Powers are about to exchange places, there is a slight delay before the East Germans deliver the American student to complete their part of the bargain.Yes of course I understand that Donovan dramatically threatened the East Germans, as they could have been blamed by the Russians for sabotaging the spy swap. But their decision was really a forgone conclusion too, as the East Germans were always under the yoke of the Russians, and were in no position to act independently (balking at giving up the student of course was their way of ""saving face"").With all this lack of suspense, it was incumbent upon Mr. Spielberg's screenwriters (including ""luminaries"" Joel and Ethan Coen) to manufacture a series of fictional events to spice up a ""thriller"" that hardly thrills at all! Here a few examples: spectators at Abel's sentencing did not loudly object to the no death penalty sentence; Donovan and family were not victims of a drive-by shooting; Donovan's coat was not stolen by a gang in East Berlin (in reality, Donovan merely observed a gang nearby) and Donovan never personally observed people being killed as they attempted to climb over the Berlin Wall.Spielberg's attempt to recreate the era is rife with numerous gaffes. Early on Donovan is seen riding in a in a NYC R-32 subway car that first went into service in 1964 (the scene is set in 1961). That wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the interior of the car appears to be from the 70s and beyond, and not 1961. The gaffes, which include anachronisms, character error, continuity, errors in geography, factual errors, plot holes, revealing mistakes and miscellaneous errors are all detailed under the Bridge of Spies ""Goofs"" section on IMDb.""Bridge of Spies"" is not a complete loss as the film features some excellent acting by Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy Abel. With its 40 million dollar budget and decided lack of suspense, I wonder why the film was made in the first place. It of course gives Spielberg an opportunity to peddle a rather simplistic and obvious message: there were some bad people on the other side of the Iron Curtain (faceless soldiers shooting people trying to escape over the Berlin War) but also individuals such as master spy Abel, who end up displaying unexpected glimpses of humanity.","

"Bridge of Spies","larrys3","5 February 2016","Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance lead the way here and give superlative performances in this cerebral and powerful Cold War drama. Another masterful movie from director Steven Spielberg, with a most solid screenplay from Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel.The films all centers around the initial defense of accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) by attorney James B.Donovan (Hanks), which made Donovan a most unpopular man in America, especially when he appealed Abel's conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the conviction by a 5-4 vote.Meanwhile, in 1960, a U.S. U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers was captured by the Soviets, after his spy plane was shot down over Soviet territory. Subsequently, the American State Dept. would ask Donovan to possibly negotiate an exchange of Abel and Powers, since Donovan had been contacted by the Soviets through the East Germans that this might be possible.Based on true events, there's plenty of intrigue here as Donovan, through intense and difficult negotiations, tries to acquire the release of the two prisoners, along with a third prisoner the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), being held on ""spy"" charges by the East Germans. It will all culminate in some amazing and tense scenes on the German Glienicke Bridge.All in all, I found this to be a first class movie, that despite it's length of 2 hrs. and 21 min., had me absorbed throughout.","

"Bridge of Spies","blanche-2","13 February 2016","""Bridge of Spies"" from 2015 is about the Francis Gary Powers incident in the 1960s. As usual, with the exception of the Lincoln assassination, I remember it. This time, though, only vaguely.The U.S. arrested a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and chose James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who had some experience in military cases, to defend him. Abel is found guilty but Donovan is able to convince the Judge to commute his sentence to life in case the U.S. needs him later - for instance, if we should want to exchange him for one of our own.That situation happens when Francis Gary Powers, taking aerial photographs for the CIA, is shot down and taken prisoner. Donovan is then sent to negotiate the exchange.For many people, this will be a slow, talky drama, with one big action scene, Powers being shot down, and one scene of tension (if you don't know the outcome).It is, however, a very good drama with Hanks giving a strong and sometimes humorous performance as Donovan, thrust into the world of international spies and negotiations. He takes it upon himself to also work for the freedom of an American student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) who was arrested for being at the wrong place at the wrong time. That student is the only person involved in the case who is alive today, at 83, and praised the film but thought they ""took a lot of liberties with it."" Well, that's Hollywood.The main reason, other than historical interest, to watch this film is the performance of Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel. A winner of three Tony awards, two Olivier awards, and a BAFTA, Rylance is a highly regarded stage actor, known as the best of his generation. He's made very few films but he's about to make more and take the film industry by storm.As Abel, Rylance creates a human being, portraying him as a quiet, unassuming older man sent to do a job. He bonds with Donovan, but he tells him that he's not afraid to die. He spends his time in prison drawing. It is a remarkable performance which has earned him an Oscar nomination.Strangely, many people involved in this incident didn't live too long after -- Abel, who returned to the Soviet Union and to his family, lectured for 10 years and died in 1971; Donovan died in 1970; and Powers died in a helicopter crash while working for a TV station in 1977.I hope the film will encourage some people to read up on this case - of course, I always hope that. Maybe some time somebody will do it rather than posting the question someone did about Gandhi -- was this a fictional character.","

"Bridge of Spies","nsharath009","6 October 2015","A feel-good Cold War melodrama, Bridge of Spies is an absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous ""war"" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the ""we won"" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation.","

"Bridge of Spies","Michael_Elliott","13 February 2016","Bridge of Spies (2015) *** (out of 4)Attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is given the thankless job of defending suspected Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Donovan accepts the job but soon finds himself defending his client a bit too good for some, which leads to him being the main negotiator between America and Russia when it comes time for a prisoner swap.Steven Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES isn't one of the director's greatest works but it's certainly a very well-made film that manages to hold your attention throughout the rather long running time. I must admit that the trailer for the film really left me cold so I wasn't sure what to expect from the film but overall it's another good movie from the director, although the ending falls into that cringe-worthy, over-sentimental stuff that the director does quite often.With that said, there's no doubt that there's a highly good story being told here that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. The screenplay by Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman does a very good job at capturing the spirit of the period and even if you're not familiar with the Cold War the film does a nice job at bringing you up to speed on the various fears. Spielberg perfectly handles the material and milks it for some nice drama as well as some political points that are certainly meant to be taken into consideration on some current issues.Hanks, as you'd expect, turns in an excellent performance and is certainly believable in the role of the attorney who finds his life spinning out of control from not only his wife but strangers who feels he is helping a spy. Hanks is such a calm grace that it really was entertaining just seeing him negotiate. Rylance also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played this character and I really loved the laid back approach to where the character never tips his cap in regards to what and who he really is. Technically speaking the film is quite good and of high standards.BRIDGE OF SPIES could have been a bit tougher on the political aspects but it's goal was to aim for the mainstream and in the end it's an entertaining film.","

I am dazzled by that time in history: surveillance, the cars, CIA, Eisenhower, and the mystique of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. From the trailer of this film, I expected a delicious plate of Cold War atmosphere, intrigue, and commentary. Like a gleeful child, I sprinted to the movie theatre – expecting a non-pretentious high octane version of Mad Men. I anticipated my favorite era in history being served up like LET ME IN (a piece of 1980s period perfection elegantly directed by Matt Reeves).I held close the trailer as I landed my perfect middle seat in the theatre. The clips of a U2 Surveillance jet spiraling at 70,000 feet, children overflowing in tears as they watch a thermonuclear film strip, and Tom Hanks' face plastered to a subway window as we see guards firing at bystanders trying to climb over the Berlin Wall. Then you add Steven Spielberg to the mix – the master of the period piece – modern cinema - the evoker of our deepest emotions. One of my favorite Spielberg films is Munich. Munich captures the violence of the Middle East 70s with revere, respect, and revelation. This is what I wanted from Bridge Of Spies. I wanted a dark, harrowing portrait of the Cold War, I wanted this tense era exposed in Spielbergian fashion, and I wanted to have 1957-1961 ruminating in my heart, mind, and belly. Bridge of Spies, however, met none of my desired expectations. Diluted by a PG-13 rating, filled with comedic moments (clearly due to the Coen Brothers having written or participated in this script) that don't tickle my fancy, and an avoidance of Cold War atmosphere – Bridge Of Spies hit me like a tennis ball on the head. It's taught, adequately plotted, and the hero is smart, likable, and witty. It's garnered rave reviews. But, for anyone that likes substance, don't look here. Spielberg's story is a moral tale – of courage and standing up for one's ideals – the universal plot which Steven devours like a hungry child. Unfortunately, there's no stakes. Hanks follows his journey and does what he does best – but his universe is given little context. You'll want turkey and you'll get turkey – but you're not getting any gravy. **Possible Spoilers – Things that bugged me about the film was plethora of wasted opportunities. When you have Spielberg at the helm, you know what could have been – 1. The relationship between the Lawyer (Hanks) and the Soviet Captive (Mark Rylance) is an unbalanced paper weight. We get a glimpse into the Lawyer's character, the archetypal Tom Hanks - fair, honest, moral, etc. We get very little info on the Captive. He is quiet, dignified, and keeps responding to Hanks wondering if he is aware of his dire situation, ""Would it help?"" Rylance is the typical Spielbergian ""caught in the middle guy"" – much like Ben Kingsley in Schindler's List. Physically weak, trapped and powerless - yet stoic and unafraid. That being said, what are his motives? He is a spy but what drives him – where is the monologue where he explains his background, what formed and shaped him and what forms the basis of his lifelong goals?2. What I love about Mad Men is its strong focus on the media and culture of the era. Except for the end of Bridge of Spies (where we get a clip of Pierre Salinger informing the news of the spy swap) and an early scene of a teenage girl watching a late night story, there's not much to nibble on – Spielberg wastes a huge opportunity in a class room scene where kids are watching a nuclear bomb film strip. Lifting the film strip like a YouTube Clip and then showing a few generic shots of kids watching it and one girl crying - the master of modern cinema stumbles and falls into shallow surf. In this instance, I wanted to yell at the editor – build this up, let it seep in, give us some Wonder Years or Let Me In flavor. There's none to be had – 3. Not only do we get a vapid Francis Gary Powers – due to lackluster character development and the miscasting (in my opinion), but the U2 Surveillance storyline is about 12 minutes. Give me at least 25, Steven!! When the U2 is shot out of the sky, we get about a minute of action – give us three. In addition, because Francis Gary Powers has no character development, I don't sympathize with him or even care if he comes home. 4. The PhD student who is included in the Prisoner Swap is devoid of character – another guy that I could care less if he makes it home. Both guys appeared to have a lackluster indifferent time over the in the USSR. The Soviets dowsed Powers with water and German soldiers rip up the PHD students thesis paper – oh no!5. There is no discussion of the disastrous political implications of the U2 being shot down over the Soviet Union. Reluctant to authorize the mission, Eisenhower was smeared by its failure and left office of the President on a black cloud. However, we don't hear Eisenhower's name mentioned once in the story. All and all, Spielberg delivers a cup of vanilla ice cream with fudge – most audiences are going to love Hanks and the Soviet spy. In the final analysis, it's a buddy film with some period costumes and a somewhat poignant conclusion. That being said, those that want a stirring pot of fear, sadness, and elation – I suggest you wait for this on HBO and watch Munich instead. Ted's Personal Enjoyment: C+","

"Bridge of Spies","tjgoalie13","18 October 2015","Bridge Of Spies is a well acted, thrilling, smart Cold War drama that features a Oscar worthy performance from Tom hanks. Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said the film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks performance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar nomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have been, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.","

"Bridge of Spies","dierregi","31 December 2015","If you expect to see much spying or bridges in this movie you will be sorely disappointed. The plot is about ace lawyer Tom Hanks (his screen name does not really matter, since the movie is just star performance) who is going to prove how good he is, both to the Russians and the East-Germans.A rather puffy-faced Hanks is in most scenes, playing a smug and arrogant lawyer, who always gets the last word and whatever he wants. His performance as a the lawyer is rather overbearing and even slightly unpleasant, but the public still liked him a lot and laughed at all his one-liners (again, star performance, rather than good plot or script).The spies or would-be spies featured in the movie are: 1) a sour little man, who speaks with what sounded to me an Irish accents and who was supposed to be funny with his unflappability. He repeats ""Would it help if I worry?"" countless times, every time getting a laugh 2) a rather dumb American pilot and 3) another sort of heroic American student, getting mixed up with foreign politics, when he'd better stayed at home. They all seem to be just props to give Hanks a chance to shine.The moral of the story should be that all countries should be better off minding their own business. However, this sound unrealistic, so the moral is that American heroes (especially Tom Hanks) always save the day. Mind the overbearing soundtrack that seems to come straight out ""Saving private Ryan""","

"Bridge of Spies","PWNYCNY","22 October 2015","This movie is long, stagy, pretentious and boring. The acting is hammy, and the characters are drab and inspire little interest. The tension should have been gripping. Instead it is absent. The ending of movie is already known and is anti-climatic. The movie seems to suggest that Abel was not treated fairly and downplays the seriousness of his crimes and the sinister nature of his work. The treatment of Francis Gary Powers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker. For an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and Powers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains no heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock characters and situations usually employed to give a story some substance. Instead, the movie just plods along to its foregone conclusion. Why would any movie maker find such bland characters worthy of a movie? The real story is how the Soviets managed to shoot down an American spy plane flying at 70,000 feet. How the Soviets were able to detect and target a U2 flying at that altitude is not explained, nor is the huge political fallout caused by the Powers debacle even mentioned. Indeed, the names of Eisenhower and Khrushchev are absent, yet in the actual event they were the key players, and by leaving them out, there's no story.","

"Bridge of Spies","A_Different_Drummer","13 December 2015","... but not necessarily a very entertaining one.First -- and this is the key to my review --- semi-biographical films documenting real events do not have to be dull, or tedious, or dark, or lack connection with the viewer.Look at PAWN SACRIFICE, for example, recently reviewed by this reviewer and still very much top of mind.And then we have BRIDGE OF SPIES, a two-plus hour opus that one suspects never would have been greenlighted without you-know-who as the director and you-know-who playing the lead.Presumably we are meant to honor the main character's humanity as he struggles against a corrupt (or possibly insane) system to do the right thing...? If this was the intent, then even a yeoman effort from Hanks fails to make this character connect with the viewer, to resonate. In spite of it all, he comes across as a wildcard pick in a game which he never really understood.And if the events of the last few years are any indication -- this written in 2015 -- it was a game the rest of us never understood either.","

"Bridge of Spies","zardoz-13","26 October 2015","Historians have chronicled the events during the intervening fifty-three years in director Steven Spielberg's gripping Cold War thriller ""Bridge of Spies,"" so little comes as a complete surprise. Despite the conspicuous absence of suspense, this lavishly produced, persuasively acted, and thoroughly engrossing film remains utterly captivating. Working from a screenplay by Matt Charman, rewritten by Joel and Ethan Cohen of ""Fargo"" fame, Spielberg makes largely minor departures from the actual occurrences as they unfolded and recreates history with atmospheric spontaneity. Tom Hanks plays the congenial central character in this literate chess game of international espionage that opens with the arrest of a Soviet spy in America and culminates on a lonely Berlin bridge at dawn with rival world superpowers swapping the spy for captured U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. Spielberg doesn't squander a second in this literate narrative and shoehorns a plethora of action into 135 minutes without resorting to glamorous heroics and gratuitous pyrotechnics. Everybody always raves about the magnitude of story above all else, and ""Bridge of Spies"" exemplifies why a good, solid story—even one that has been well-documented in the international press at the time—can still yield an immensely entertaining film. Each character stands out dramatically, and each has been etched with sympathy so we are concerned about their situation. At the heart of the matter, ""Bridge of Spies"" emerges as a realistic, bona fide ""Mission Impossible"" outing when you consider all the variables that the unseen hand of fate brought to the table. What makes it doubly interesting is that only a singular incident like this could have ushered these individuals into each other's company.""Bridge of Spies"" unfolds with the FBI arresting Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance of ""Prospero's Books"") in Brooklyn during 1957. Abel had maintained a low-profile as one of the top Soviet spies in America. Masquerading as an artist, he collected sensitive information without calling attention to himself. The Soviets relied on what are known as dead letter mail boxes. Information could be stashed and retrieved, without it being apparent to most people, in innocuous places. Abel sat on a bench one day to paint a picture of a bridge. As he adjusted his easel, he felt under the bench and found a hollowed coin containing a coded message. Later, after the Feds raided his studio apartment, Abel destroyed the message under their noses while they ransacked his premises for incriminating evidence. At this point, Brooklyn insurance claims attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks of ""Forrest Gump"") enters the arena. The corporate law firm where he is a partner informs him that the New York Bar Association wants him to serve as Abel's pro-bono counsel so nobody can impugn American justice. Mind you, everybody but Donovan considers Abel's conviction a foregone conclusion. Of course, he concedes he has been chosen to defend the most hated man in America. ""Everyone will hate me,"" Donovan laments, ""but at least I'll lose."" Neither Donovan's wife, Mary (Amy Ryan of ""Capote""), nor his children share his principles. Nevertheless, Donovan goes into court swinging with everything that he has, and he discovers the deck has been stacked against him. Judge Byers (Dakin Matthews of ""Thirteen Days"") refuses to grant Donovan adequate time to prepare Abel's defense. Later, when Donovan advises Byers that the FBI had no search warrant so all the evidence should be banned, the judge ignores him. Inevitably, despite his noble efforts, Donovan cannot clear Abel. Later, Donovan visits the judge at his honor's residence and persuades the crusty old jurist to display some compassion and sentence the Soviet to prison rather than the electric chair. Byers heeds Donovan's advice despite frenzied public opinion after he delivers his verdict.In the meantime, the CIA recruits U.S.A.F. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell of ""Whiplash"") to fly a high altitude jet to conduct aerial reconnaissance over the U.S.S.R. A Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile cripples Power's plane. He bails out, but fails to obliterate his U2 plane. Of course, the Soviet capture Powers, convict him as a spy, and sentence him to prison. Not long afterward, Donovan receives a letter from the Soviets and finds himself flying to Berlin as a private citizen to negotiate a prisoner exchange: Abel for Powers. Donovan gets the royal runaround between the Soviets as well as the East Berlin authorities. Nonetheless, he proves himself to be a shrewd man with a bargain, and he pits the Soviets against East Berlin. Ultimately, he never gives ground during these complicated negotiations. The catch is he must negotiate between the superpowers as a private individual rather than an official American envoy. Read Donovan's insightful memoir ""Strangers on the Bridge,"" and you'll acquire a new appreciation for this crafty attorney.Hanks brings a jovial, 'aw shucks' Jimmy Stewart charm to his portrayal of Donovan. Literally, ""Bridge of Spies"" could be seen as ""Mr. Smith Goes to Berlin."" Hanks looks like a paunchy, unassuming figure without a clue, but he emerges as the sharpest tack in the box. Donovan's history is pretty amazing when you think about what he accomplished. Meantime, Mark Rylance distinguishes himself as Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and he overshadows Hanks with a 'less is more' performance. Repeatedly, Donovan makes comments about Abel's apparent lack of anxiety. Facing certain death, the imperturbable Abel refuses to let the pressure affect him. ""Would it help?"" he queries Donovan to worry about his fate. Austin Stowell reminded me of cub reporter Jimmy Olsen from the 1950s' ""Superman"" TV show. He embodies the wholesome, clean-cut, but ambitious American who refuses to commit suicide and struggles to make the best of a dreadful predicament.Spielberg does an exceptional job of condensing and cross-cutting these events. Budgeted at $40 million, ""Bridge of Spies"" looks authentic with its multiple locations in American and Europe. Indisputably, ""Bridge of Spies"" couldn't have been produced during the Cold War because objectivity would have been harshly compromised. Spielberg's historical reenactment is relevant because contemporary American democracy faces similar challenges.","

"Bridge of Spies","ThomasDrufke","18 October 2015","I don't know what it is about 2015, but I think this year has been full of films that don't entirely meet your expectations. I don't necessarily mean that those films are bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems like film after film end up making me feel a bit letdown. Bridge of Spies is the new Steven Spielberg directed film based on true events during the cold war. It focuses on James B. Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is thrust into representing a supposed Soviet spy in court and Donovan's further involvement in executing an exchange of prisoners with Russia.Much like Crimson Peak, this film is not really what the trailers make it out to be. The trailers heavily focused on the relationship between Donovan and his client, Rudolf Abel. The film gives us maybe 20 minutes between them in the beginning, but really that's all. To me, their relationship and the scenes between Hanks and Mark Rylance, who plays Abel, are easily the best the film has to offer. Even though it's never truly clear as to why Donovan backs this man so much and his motivations behind continuing the negotiations, I really bought into their dynamic. In fact, it's the only true payoff you get in the end is their relationship and its outcome.By no means is Bridge of Spies a bad film, it's not. It doesn't help that it's directed by perhaps the greatest director of all time, in Steven Spielberg. Expectations are sometimes far too high for his films. But I think the problem here is that there's just not a ton of meat to this story and it's one of Spielberg's weaker films in recent memory, but really he doesn't make any bad films. Some things did bother me about his directing here though. For example, there is a character introduced within the first 10 minutes as Donovan's associate and partner. He attends Donovan's family dinner and seems to be set up as help to Donovan and a slight possible romance is hinted at with this character and Donovan's daughter. Well, after one scene we don't see this character ever again.Amy Ryan plays Donovan's wife, who I absolutely adore as an actress, is also incredibly underused. I guess what I'm trying to get across here is that there is no flow to the movie. Or rather, no arc. It's very predictable, being a true story, but the tension isn't there either. It's a slow moving picture with a great climax but not a ton of build to get to that great climax. Surprisingly, this could be contributed to Spielberg. Spielberg does do a great job of taking us to the time of the Cold War. He certainly gives us the feeling that at any moment war could have been truly started by either side. The performances are all really good. Mark Rylance who plays Abel does a magnificent job in his limited screen-time and rightfully never gives one way or another in terms of his innocence. Tom Hanks is, well, Tom Hanks. And Thomas Newman replaces John Williams as the composer and does a wonderful job as he always does. There's a lot to really like about Bridge of Spies, more than not. But for me, it was just a bit of a letdown in its lack of intensity and pay off. I wouldn't have known it was the Coen Bros script and Spielberg's directing if it wasn't for the trailers and marketing.+Rylance & Hanks together+Spielberg transports you to the Cold War+Newman's score+Climax-Lack of intensity-Didn't get enough of Donovan and Abel together7.0/10","

"Bridge of Spies","Instant_Palmer","2 July 2023","Good guys DO sometimes win... We would like to believe this is true all the time. In the story presented so ably by Spielberg and the Cohen Brothers, and as acted in the Lead by Tom Hanks in this film, we can feel good that Right has might, and good guys can and DO win.2015 was an amazing year in American cinema - three of the finest films since 2000, 'A Bridge Of Spies', 'Spotlight', and 'Sicario' were released in the same year. Spotlight deserved its position as Best Film of the Year. But Bridge of Spies presented close competition - In terms of the ""feel good"" aspect, if there were an award for such, Bridge wins. The brilliant, gritty, and moody Sicario might be the best-ever film depicting the War on Drugs on and over our Southern border.With parameters of Academy Awards now ""conditional"" upon social justice messaging in 2023, a year like 2015 may be one of the last in the foreseeable future, where films shall be judged solely upon its art excellence by the Academy, something I didn't think ever necessary, as the freedom of speech and free choice has always been innately present in film art - does it really need oversight? Kind of defeats the ideals inherent in art imo.Regardless, Bridge is fabulous, one of Spielberg's best films, Hanks knocking it over the Berlin Wall and spellbinding acting by Mark Rylance who deserved his Supporting Actor statuette.HIGHLY recommended viewing!👍👍","

"Bridge of Spies","TheLittleSongbird","28 April 2016","'Bridge of Spies' had much going for it, mainly that it's based on a very interesting story, Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance are talented actors with some very noteworthy performances and when in his prime Steven Spielberg directed some of the most relentlessly entertaining and entertaining films in cinema.While 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of Spielberg's finest films, in the way 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'ET', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Empire of the Sun', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Jurassic Park' are, for me despite its flaws along with 'Lincoln' and 'War Horse' (remember liking 'Munich' a lot too, though it needs a re-watch) it's one of his better ones since 'AI'.There is not an awful lot wrong with 'Bridge of Spies', though due to the subject matter it's not going to appeal to all tastebuds. To me, it's biggest problem was pacing. By all means not a continuous problem, because there was enough in the film that was really engaging, but parts do drag and not every scene felt like it was needed. The beginning is notably draggy and the film could easily have ended after the climactic scene on the bridge, because the ending did feel unnecessarily stretched and was particularly guilty of the sappiness and over-sentimentality that Spielberg is often criticised for. Similarly Donovan's family scenes could have been excised with no problem, they add very little and their cloying nature did feel too much and misplaced within the rest of the film. The only other problem was Thomas Newman's score, it's nicely composed and it fits at least (to have it used sparingly was also a good move in order to not distract from the atmosphere and dialogue) but there is nothing hugely memorable or anything to go wow over or that evokes any strong emotions. Not bad as such, just bland.However, 'Bridge of Spies', as always with Spielberg is incredibly well-made, as well as directed with a lot of class. It is sumptuously shot and the period detail is elegant, atmospheric and positively eye catching, especially the scenes in Berlin where you actually feel the cold, austerity and tension. While there is a lot of talk in 'Bridge of Spies', the script is thought-provoking and tightly structured, not making the mistake of being rambling, using complicated jargon or being too wordy. There is even some nice knowing witty humour that gives the film some freshness and is well-incorporated when it appears, while the political and patriotic elements avoid being preachy. While the pace is not completely secure and not every scene felt necessary, the story is very absorbing and is told with intelligence, tension and emotion. While there is perhaps not enough on the trial, that part is very intriguingly done, while the Berlin scenes that dominate the film have a lot of tension and suspense. The shift from America to Berlin is handled well and not too crudely, a very easy thing to do when visually and atmospherically their scenes are so different.The characters are engagingly written on the most part, with the exception of Donovan's family (his wife in particular is the typical nurturing but frustrated cliché with little variation on it). Donovan is one of those characters that holds the narrative together as strong as a rock and is easily rootable, while Abel comes close to being the most sympathetic character while at the same time evoking some chills. The chemistry between the two characters is very strongly done. All the acting is very good (though Amy Ryan barely registers in the role that gives her very little to work with), with Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance being outstanding. Hanks is effortlessly commanding and has such a great cool charisma, essential for a lead role that is on screen for almost the whole duration. Despite his screen time being much less, Rylance portrays Abel with quiet understated dignity, with his expressions and eyes speaking every bit as much as when he's delivering his lines, that comes over both chillingly and heart-wrenchingly.All in all, excellent and often very absorbing. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox","

"Bridge of Spies","drqshadow-reviews","1 February 2016","Hanks and Spielberg tackle a Cold War spy-exchange against the backdrop of a freshly-constructed Berlin Wall. As one might expect from these old masters, it's expertly-crafted and loaded with gravitas; a warm, motivated take on a surprisingly under-explored chapter of recent history. It does a great job of delicately re-evaluating popular sentiment and the bullish nature of post-war international relations, too, painting heroes and victims on both sides of the dispute. The plot is very linear, though, moving on a predictable set of rails from start to finish, and that can make it feel preachy when a few of the more heavy-handed themes briefly overstay their welcome. A foundationally-strong, workmanlike offering, it's 50% desperately-uphill legal drama and 50% high stakes poker with a set of captive American souls as the ante.","

"Bridge of Spies","Rogermex","18 October 2015","Spielberg knows what he did, but I have a few thoughts. Let's start with the title - You know, there's only one ""spy"" per se, who matters anyway. But it makes it sound like some thriller-diller, eh?Now Tom Hanks - uh, what's with that incredibly furrowed, knit brow all through the story. Makeup Oscar time? Did they borrow it from a Klingon?The woman who plays Donovan's wife? I know she's supposed to be convincingly all 1950s square - but really, heels and full lipstick all the time? Smiling at everything? At least they didn't plug in Jessica Chastain, that would not have been credible opposite Donovan's shlubby character. A performance as flat as one of those pancakes in the big American breakfast he never ate.The youth are not at this movie, they're all out to see the latest vampire/zombie/Tom Cruise dreck. So the boomers out to see an ennobling patriotic drama have lived through all this, including ""duck and cover"" and the Missile Crisis. Do those of us who actually were terrorized and traumatized by all that really need pedantic little lessons about the bombs and the sirens, delivered by Donovan's delusional little genius son? I found it insulting.Of course, all the Russians are scene-chewing geeky monsters, sometimes in such close-up we can see the beet-bits in their teeth.Gosh, it was cold in that Cold War! So we have to see everyone blowing and wiping their noses, boogers hanging, in order to get the idea?Exception: Mark Rylance, the only great thing about the movie. I've been watching Rylance in ""Wolf Hall,"" and it's very impressive how he can create such a level of charismatic tension by hardly doing anything at all. He's all stillness, posture, little eye movements and gazes, all restrained, all coiled in. Amazing.Back to the thriller at hand. So in the big spectacle scene where the U2 gets shot down, did Spielberg really need to show off, proving ""Oh, I can do 'Gravity,' I can do 'The Walk'"" just for bragging cred? And is it actually historically true that Powers gripped on to edge of his crumbling cockpit and just failed to hit the destruct button before his tether broke? (OH! is that a sneaky symbolic allusion to 'aborting' a mission?)This whole thing could have been done as a 15-minute documentary (not that I'd like seeing another documentary) rather than puffed up into a dry and predictable ""drama. When we see Hanks' character lying face down on his bed at home because he's so beat, I suppose if I were him I'd be concerned to hide my face for having accepted another such stereotypical heroic individual little man role.Do nasty CIA agents really skip into the air in peevish excitement like an 11-year old when they get frustrated? (Oh, they probably do.)It might have been more exciting to get into a row with the dopey woman in the seats behind us who kept aggravating my wife by kneeing and bumping the back of her seat - but ""Would it help?""So the Coen brothers helped write this. I guess Spielberg thought it might be more tasty to shmear some funky mustard on this baloney sandwich, but ""Would it help?"" My fantasy is that the Coens were often snickering up their sleeves.","

"Bridge of Spies","AlienByChoice","22 October 2015","Hanks, Alda, Spielberg, the Coen brothers. What can go wrong? Apparently, quite a lot.Strengths first: the meticulous recreation of the 60's across two countries is breathtaking. The streets look 60's, the people look and talk 60's, the atmosphere is 60's. It's immersing and awe-inspiring.Now the weaknesses: 1) Lots and lots of exposition. I understand that the millenials are expected to not know the history from 50 years ago, but come on - if someone doesn't know/love history they aren't going to see this movie in the first place. Stop wasting our time with exposition. 2) Poor acting. This must be the weakest performance from Tom Hanks I've seen in years. The guy is sleep-walking through the role, and everyone else is wooden and not worth mentioning, except for Alan Alda who steals every scene he's in. Amy Ryan is just awful I'm sorry to say. 3) Too long. Way too long. Should've ended with the exchange taking place. We don't need the ""happy end"" through vindication - it's completely implausible too. 4) Not focused. The pilot's story is completely surplus to requirements and insignificant - it doesn't add anything to the narrative. We don't really need to see the pilot until his first scene in captivity. Instead, the time should be spent on character development of which there is absolutely none. 5) Predictable. Yes, the story is well known and we all know how it ends, but this means that the unpredictability needs to be in the nuances. The little things that aren't part of the written history. But everything is predictable, nothing is captivating. 6) The treatment of the story. The script is by the Coen brothers but it has John Le Carre written all over it. It's a classic Le Carre-like spy thriller (thriller, not action). There have been fantastic film adaptations of Le Carre, so we know it can be done. Sadly, on this occasion Spielberg fails to deliver.4/10","

"Bridge of Spies","barev-85094","8 December 2015","BRIDGE of SPIES, Spielberg // Starring Tom Hanks in Lukewarm Coldwar drama.Summary: Uninspired Spielberg Mountain from Molehill with pitiful Hanks in Pain throughout. Viewed at Colisée cinema, Marrakesh, Friday Dec. 4, 2015. By Alex Deleon. With so many intriguing Cold War subjects up for grabs one wonders what made Steven Spielberg choose this relatively minor Cold War incident as the subject matter of his latest directorial effort. The background: In the summer of 1960 an American high altitude spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union and pilot Gary Powers who bailed out and survived was interned by the Russians. At about the same time a big time Russian spy with US citizenship was arrested and put on trail for treason in the USA. Idealistic New York attorney James Donovan (Hanks) defends him in court and is then recruited by the CIA to facilitate an exchange of this spy for captured U2 spy plane pilot Powers in Berlin. The exchange took place in divided Berlin on Feb. 20, 1962 at the height of the Kennedy administration six months prior to the Cuban Missiles crisis. The foreground: The result: a big disappointment with a heavy handed script by the Coen Brothers and some very bad acting in a long tedious dragged out attempt to elevate this subject to the level of Greek tragedy with Tom Hanks pulling slightly different variations of a pained face in every scene he's in, which is most of the picture. Greek tragedy this is not, although we are compelled to feel a little sorry for Hanks when his steadfast defense of the American Constitution is met with hate, derision, and even death threats from his fellow Americans, and then he has to hide his dangerous spy exchange trip from his own family when he volunteers to go to Berlin on a thankless top secret mission to ease cold war tensions and save an American college student stranded in East Berlin into the bargain. En somme:to sum up --From The combination Spielberg/Hanks and the setting in Berlin, a city I know so well, I expected much more. This turned out to be a routine, almost soppy Hanks performance and a very routine uninspired turn by Spielberg at the helm. First of all I remember the era of the film very well and it did not seem to me at the time to be nearly the momentous event it is built up to be in this film. If lawyer Donavan (Hanks) was in the news for a while it certainly wasn't a very big while, and the spy exchange at the bridge was merely seen as a minor event in much more momentous cold war Events of the time such as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1962 and The Cuban missile crisis in October 1962. I remember thinking at the time that it was nice for our side to admit for once that We also Spy and thought that might be the ball Spielberg would run with. But the mawky family drama we are given, and the overall talkiness with little backup action, plus the building up of the the exchange on the Berlin bridge in freezing winter weather to an event of Superbowl proportions simply does not have the drama we are supposed to think it had. Overall, a dud that fails to go off in a stagy unrecognizable Berlin. Recommended only for die-hard Tom Hankniks who sympathize with Mr. next-door America, no matter what he does. As for the Cold War political background -- Google tells it much better. (Google, Gary Powers, U2 incident) Alex, Marrakesh.:","

"Bridge of Spies","DKosty123","20 February 2016","There are theories that the Francis Gary Powers shoot down by USSR had something to do with JFK's eventual death. This movie stays away from that and instead the focus is on how the US made a deal to get Powers back. Based on a true story this movie tries to recreate the drama behind all these events.It does so without sinking to the depths of action sequences which director Spielberg often directs. He is proving to be a capable drama director as Lincoln proved that just a short time ago. Somehow he brought the Coen's in to write this drama along with Matt Charman. The result is a quite functional drama replete with the feeling of the cold war.The history lesson here is of value and this film is done totally from the US perspective. This makes sense as the other side was not consulted on this one. The film might even be a little too careful on how it is presented. Tom Hanks is always good though in this film there is not a lot of character development other than Hanks and the Russian Spy (Mark Rylance) Rudolph Abel who is excellent. Hanks wife gets little bits of stuff but not much and even Hank's assistant Doug - Billy Magnussen gets but one or two scenes. This film is a 2 figure drama, and the main draw back is while they explain how great this accomplishment was, there is very little of why the reasons the negotiations were so successful. This is a timely reminder about a Cold War which is now often forgotten, now that there are hot wars going in several countries today.This is when diplomacy was practiced and refined so as to achieve positive results. It is solid and well done.","

"Bridge of Spies","Laakbaar","17 February 2016","This is the story of James Donovan, who during the Cold War became a sort of secret negotiator for the American government in the trade off of Russian spy Rudolph Abel and American pilot Gary Powers.The portrayal of America during the Cold War is absolutely wonderful.Hanks's performance is excellent, as one has come to expect from the man. He is utterly believable, despite his fame.It helped that much of the movie takes place in Berlin, a city I love. Spielberg does a terrific job in showing Cold War Berlin and particularly the horror of the city getting divided.Don't believe those who are saying that the movie is too jingoistic. It's not. Spielberg and Coen don't avoid controversial issues. The movie-goer is jarred with a few thought-provoking comparisons and some gentle reminders of the difficulties of life and hypocrisies of that era. Much of the movie deals with the legal issues involved. Donovan, originally an insurance litigator, is the lawyer for the Russian spy.I have to give this movie 9/10 because I can't think of a single thing wrong with it. (OK, there is one thing: I can't say the movie really moved me that much.) This is movie-making at its best. Look at who is involved: Spielberg, Hanks, the Coen brothers, and so on.

"Bridge of Spies","Prolecenter","13 August 2016","A new film set in the Cold War era of the 1950's was released a few weeks ago and is apparently a big hit. The plot revolves around James B. Donovan, a simple lawyer who is chosen to defend Colonel Rudolf Abel, a captured Soviet spy, in the midst of an atmosphere of anti-communist hysteria sweeping the US. Later in the movie Mr. Donovan is recruited by CIA to negotiate the release of captured American spies in exchange for Colonel Abel, including U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers who was captured by the Soviets after his spy plane was shot down in Soviet airspace. The tortured tagline of the film sums up the propaganda point to be driven home: ""In the shadow of war, one man showed the world what we stand for."" What we (the US) stand for is supposedly a just and humane society where everyone, even a communist spy, is entitled to a fair trial. This is set against the supposed tyranny and cruelty of communist states.However, the version of events presented in this film and the case it attempts to make in favor of an American system of ""fair play"" can easily be disproved. Many relevant details have been distorted or conveniently left out of the narrative. Also, some facts have been included but presented out of any historical context. Unfortunately, most Americans will passively accept this false narrative without question or without doing any further study of their own. They will accept the movie as being a true recounting of historical events. I could now spend a lot of time discussing every single propaganda element within the film such as the dark and gloomy atmosphere in East Berlin; the scowling faces of the East German border guards; the menacing and hostile demeanor of various communist officials or scenes of torture, but I have decided to take a different approach. I will simply tell the truth of the historical incident that this film is supposedly based on; and I will do it using the memoirs of the two primary American participants in these events - James Donovan and Francis Powers.Let's start by comparing the details and outcomes of the Abel trial in the US with that of Powers' trial in the Soviet Union. Both spies were caught red-handed and so there could be no doubt as to their guilt in both cases. Therefore, the purpose of the trials should have been simply to gather all the facts available in an effort to come up with a suitable punishment to fit the crime. Below, I have included a table that shows the results of each trial.Powers (Soviet trial) Abel (US trial) Held Incommunicado 4 weeks 3 weeks Phys. or Psych. Abuse No Yes Max. Poss. Sentence Death (rare cases) Death (very common) Actual Sentence 10 years 30 yearsPowers stated in his autobiography, written a decade after his return to the US, that he did not suffer any abuse during his captivity in the Soviet Union. Abel, however, said that during his interrogation he was struck in the face by one of the FBI agents who grew frustrated at his silence and refusal to cooperate.Powers was told by the Soviets that execution for espionage was rare in the USSR, but Abel was informed that the death penalty was very likely to be his fate. In fact, just a few years prior to Abel's trial in 1957, the Rosenbergs had been sent to the electric chair for stealing atomic secrets for the Soviet Union. Finally, in the sentences that were eventually handed down, Powers received a relatively light 10 years imprisonment while Abel was given 30 years.The Soviets were accused of subjecting Powers to a ""show trial,"" but this is exactly what the Americans did with Rudolf Abel. As it turns out, despite all the blather about the high ideals of the American legal system, Donovan and his co-conspirators were really just concerned with promoting the idea of superior values of American ""fair play,"" without any regard for the substance behind such claims. Furthermore, the real reason Mr. Donovan argued to save Abel's life was in order to hold him as a bargaining chip in the inevitable event of a spy swap with the Soviets down the road.Mr. Donovan, the humble lawyer, was actually a high-ranking career spy. He admits in his memoirs that at the time he was supposed to be impartially defending Colonel Abel, he was at that moment still a spook! In his own words he reveals that he ""still held a commission as a commander in Naval Intelligence."" Prior to that he had worked as head legal counsel in the OSS (precursor to the CIA) for several years and had helped to organize the CIA after WWII! However, from the insane viewpoint of American exceptionalism nothing here is out of place, but if this film had been done from the Soviet perspective (taking into account the undeniable facts of the incident), the plot might go like this:The US violates Soviet airspace repeatedly until one of their spy planes is finally shot down. The pilot, despite his refusal to denounce the criminal activity of his government, receives a very light sentence in comparison to America's treatment of captured Soviet agents. Some time later, a CIA spymaster shows up in East Berlin demanding the release of three American spies in exchange for one Soviet spy. Although this naturally strikes the Soviets as unfair, due to their good nature they agree. Colonel Abel returns home to a hero's welcome while Francis Powers is received with suspicion, denounced by the media and much of the American public as a traitor, and is held incommunicado by the CIA for ""debriefing"" for nearly a month.

"Bridge of Spies","thesar-2","16 January 2016","Yes, it had an interesting story and kept my interest – though the end ""true story"" statements from a Cuba negotiation sounded more heroic, but Argo, it was not. And I wasn't even the biggest fan of Argo.So, why all the Oscar buzz? Oh, I guess they still love historical, ""based on a true rescue,"" Hanks/Spielberg movies. These nominations, year after year, are making me sadder. They consistently snub GREAT films for mediocre homages. Was this a great film? Hell no. Was it very good? Nope. It falls in the ""good"" category with some good dialogue and performances. Mercifully, it won't win any Oscars, but damn, those voters really wanted you to remember they love these guys no matter what they accomplish.Picture it, U.S.A., Brooklyn 1950s – the other Best Pic nominated movie set in that timeframe.

"Bridge of Spies","moviexclusive","15 October 2015","Steven Spielberg's latest Cold War-era thriller begins with a near- wordless cat-and-mouse overture that reminds us how much of a craftsman he is. In that brilliant opening, we watch transfixed as FBI agents trail a suspected Soviet agent named Rudolf Abel through subways, sidewalks and parks of Brooklyn before finally raiding his apartment and arresting him on charges of treason and espionage. As much as you'd expect Spielberg to follow that up with screw- tightening suspense, he confounds that expectation just as quickly with a droll introduction to his lead protagonist named James Donovan, a New York insurance claims attorney arguing why the accident in which the client he is currently representing had hit a car with five people should not be referred to as ""five things"" but just ""one thing"".Sure enough, Spielberg doesn't try to do a Tom Clancy with this real-life story of how Donovan came to be appointed by the Bar to represent Abel and subsequently negotiated a tricky exchange of Soviet and American spies; instead, working with a brilliantly written script by Joel and Ethan Coen with Matt Charman that adapts freely from the historical record, Spielberg mounts a handsomely old-fashioned story of righteous underdog triumph. It is a feel-good drama in every sense of the word, one that not only celebrates Donovan's achievements but also honours the man for the principles of the U.S. Constitution for which he stood resolutely for, no matter how much others had already made up their mind about how the so-called American enemy should be treated.Unfolding in two quite distinct halves, the first sees Donovan giving Abel a stout defence despite the CIA's interference and presenting a compelling argument to the judge why his client should not be put to death, while setting up the circumstances by which Donovan will in fact be proved right. At what seems narratively the same time as the trial itself, the U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), selected as part of an elite group to take part in a top-secret mission to take highly detailed photographs of military installations within the Soviet Union, is captured by the Russians after his plane is shot down. It is not long after that the Berlin wall will be erected, which an American economics student named Richard Pryor (Will Rogers) finds himself on the wrong side of and detained by the East Germans.And so, in the second half, Donovan is recruited by the CIA to cut a deal with the Soviets that will see the former trade Abel for Powers' return – though Donovan decides on his own initiative to get two American men back for one Soviet spy. In contrast to the preceding half, this one is pretty much anchored through and through by Tom Hanks' Donovan, who makes multiple trips by himself across the Berlin Wall to negotiate separate deals with a top KGB agent on the return of Powers as well as a very Western East German lawyer named Vogel (Sebastian Koch) on Pryor's return. Donovan plays it cool in front of both the Soviets and the East Germans (what other choice does he have, really), but a scene where he is played by Vogel to be detained overnight by the East German police and another in which he watches East German refugees attempting to scale the wall being gunned down reinforces the peril within his lone-man mission as well as the complex geopolitical realities at play.There is no secret whether Donovan manages to navigate the potentially treacherous waters (pun intended) to secure both Powers' and Pryor's releases – yes, the history books will already have you know that it all culminates at the Glienicke Bridge linking West Berlin with Potsdam, from which the movie takes its name. Rather than playing up the facts of the case, Spielberg opts instead to focus on the unlikely American hero with the modesty, high principles and simple fairness who would – as a post-script informs – be called upon to play yet another instrumental role in the subsequent negotiation with Fidel Castro for the 'Bay of Pigs' invasion. Yet Spielberg doesn't over-emphasise these ideals to make Donovan any sort of an icon; rather, Donovan just does the right thing from moment to moment, with an uncanny ability of ""feeling"" the person at the other end of the negotiation.It is the sort of role that is perfectly suited for Hanks' Everyman charm, and the actor, here in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, gets it down pat. Removing any hint of sanctimoniousness, Hanks puts on, on top of a warm and generous performance, an extra air of humanity to play the rookie who, though way out of his depth in the rough and murky waters of espionage, follows a clear conscience and abiding values to emerge as an admirable hero. Hanks makes it all seem so natural, but lest we take it for granted, it does require a formidable actor to play the ordinary Capra-esque hero with a dry humour and much intellect to bear. And at least for a good third of the film, Hanks is well-matched with veteran stage actor Rylance, whose understated performance as Abel is a masterclass in itself.Indeed, there is never any doubt at any point in the film that we are amongst seasoned pros – besides Hanks and Spielberg, the latter's long-time collaborator Janusz Kaminski on camera who achieves a thick and luxurious atmosphere with his choice of shots and colour palette. This is as assured and confident Hollywood filmmaking as it gets, whether as a gripping fact-based docudrama or as a detailed character study or even as a sober lesson on tradecraft, political ideals and personal values. It is also Spielberg's best film in years, one that should and would see some deserved Oscar attention come next year.","

"Bridge of Spies","Umar Mansoor Bajwa","24 February 2016","After a long time, I was able to see and witness a captivating prisoner swap drama sequel from the declassified archives of American CIA. Steven Spielberg is all praise for his professionally meticulous direction, perfectly taking the audience to the austere world of late 50s, when the Cold War was taking its surreptitious twists and turns. All the set frames including location shooting in Germany and USA were too close to reality. The entire story, script, screenplay and dialogs were so well fed and uttered with skillful craftiness by Hanks and the soviet convict spy played by Rylance, which made viable sense and were bred with the thrill that ensures the viewer to stick to the end. It is a must see spy thriller for mature audience taking them back in time to all those moments of glory unfold from enigmatic and suggestively nerve raking espionage taking place in the classic world of late 50s. Well done Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance for superb characterization of their respective roles, skillful film editing by Michael Kahn and top of the line direction by the old timer - Steven Spielberg.","

"Bridge of Spies","quincytheodore","26 October 2015","Capturing the weight and gloom of an era, Bridge of Spies is equally a biopic and an unexpected light drama. There's a lingering intensity, especially concerning the world of secrecy, yet it's a fascinatingly accessible story with subtle refined humor. This is meant to inspire instead of evaluation of ideologies, showcasing that humanity still resides beyond the other side of border or wall.Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is an alleged Soviet spy, he's caught and set for a trial. For his defense James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is unceremoniously selected, mainly for the purpose of procedure. After a while Donovan becomes invested on defending his client despite the unusual circumstance, it then takes him on a journey to help CIA save their own agent.Despite the rather shady title, this is not the flamboyant gunslinger action ala James Bond or the intense operation like Argo. It is, strangely and also effectively, a light foray into the otherwise dark world of espionage. The pace is utterly calm, credit goes to Mark Rylance as Abel, who occasionally shows the pettiness of worrying.He and Tom Hanks have incredible chemistry, both of the characters practically have nothing in common aside from the mutual respect towards each other. Donovan himself is avid negotiator, he pushes his objective with verbal aggression, yet the movie almost never resorts to violence and even on few occasions that it does venture to bleak territory, it does so with sophistication.Rather than using typical war buildup, the movie gives faces to each party, thus humanizing them in incredibly identifiable way. It also deals with the issues of the era head-on while maintaining composure and suspending judgment. Lastly, it offers a soft touch of comedy along the way. The unexpected banters lighten the mood with timely cynical quip, it doesn't undermine the theme and still gives polished interaction between the supposed stoic personalities.Bridge of Spies is perhaps one of the most accessible depictions of a war. It might set in Cold War and showcase the grim reality of it, yet it never falters on presenting honor, duty and the best side of humanity in less than favorable time.","

"Bridge of Spies","classicalsteve","22 November 2015","For over a half-century after the Second World War, from circa 1945 to 1990, the United States was involved in a ""war"" of sorts with the USSR we call the ""Cold War"". Barring the USSR's military engagements, such as in Afghanistan and other border countries, few died on other side as a result of this Cold War (and spy thriller novelists made a fortune). The Cold War was a continual chess match of adversarial confrontation and tension between the two world super-powers and their respective allies, notably the USSR and their eastern bloc allies of the Warsaw Pact and the United States and their NATO Allies of the North Atlantic Treaty. Non-violent conflicts were nearly never-ending, their chess pieces involving spies, intelligence, and espionage, each side trying desperately to gain the upper hand over their respective adversary, constantly moving their pieces to different areas of the board. When the two sides came to secret negotiating tables, they engaged the game like poker players, holding their cards close to their chests, neither side revealing any more about their hands than absolutely necessary. ""Bridge of Spies"" written by the Cohen Brothers with Matt Charman and directed by Steven Spielberg, chronicles one such as ""game"".Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a.k.a. Vilyam ""Willie"" Genrikhovich Fisher, was an older unassuming man in a small Brooklyn apartment appearing to engage in painting projects. While under the guise of a painter, Abel was passing military secrets to Soviet agents. His cover was blown in 1957 when CIA agents raided his apartment and arrested him on charges of espionage and spying for the USSR. The US government appeals to Abel for help in their intelligence gathering in exchange for his release, but Abel declines.James Donovan (Tom Hanks), a former Nuremberg Trial associate prosecutor, is working as an insurance-claim lawyer in a New York firm. His firm asks him to defend Abel as a publicity gesture to prove the US engages in fair trails, even for those who are charged with the highest-level crimes against the United States. (The film makes it seem like he was an associate attorney forced by his firm to take the case, although at the time, Donovan was in fact a senior partner of his firm Watters and Donovan.) Donovan reluctant agrees to take the case.The respective lawyers, prosecutor and defender, meet with the trail judge who explains the trail is only for ""show"" to publicly send a message to the USSR and the world at large that the US Justice Department treats all defendants fairly and impartially, even with those accused of the most heinous of crimes against the state. However, behind closed doors, the judge indicates the verdict is a foregone conclusion. Donovan, who desires to be true to his case and his client disagrees, stating the trial should be taken seriously and not act only as a kind of international publicity stunt. Donovan then meets with his client where a mutual understanding is exchanged in which Abel makes clear he has no intention of cooperating with US intelligence authorities. At first Donovan is perturbed at his client's reluctance to aid the CIA as it could mean the death penalty for Abel. However, as their attorney-client relationship evolves, Donovan begins to have respect for Abel. Abel was engaging in activities which other men in service to the United States are doing to the other side. In a profound statement, Abel says to Donovan that he hopes an American spy caught on the other side will also not be mistreated. In the only part of the film which was a bit weak, details of the actual trial are glossed over before Abel's inevitable conviction. In a surprising turn, the judge does not give Abel the death penalty but rather sentences him to a long prison term.In a different storyline, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is a US fighter pilot recruited by the CIA to engage in intelligence gathering. Scenes between the Abel case and Powers interweave and we learn about the recruitment and training process for pilots who have been drafted into the Cold War conflict. They are now expendable chess pieces in the larger game. They learn about their equipment and their undercover tasks which is so secret they are forbidden even to tell All-Mighty God about their endeavors. At first, Powers' story seems to have little to do with the Abel case, except Powers and Abel are both intelligence-gatherers for the different sides of the Cold War. However, as events play out, the two men's destinies will become intertwined. Eventually, Donovan will be traveling to Berlin where he'll see first-hand the creation of the infamous Berlin Wall.An absolutely riveting and edge-of-your seat Cold War story. While there are no car chases and no gun-fire exchanges, the story is as compelling and suspenseful as any by Spielberg and the Cohen brothers. They are masters of the well-paced scene in which we the audience are never sure how the events will resolve. Even during the final climactic event of the film, which is largely understated, not much actually happens, but our anticipation of what might and might not occur keeps us glued to every gesture and expression. This is one of the best directorial offerings by Spielberg since ""Lincoln"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the most riveting by the Cohen Brothers since ""No Country for Old Men"". Not to be missed, but it should be noted if you're looking for an action and suspense film similar to a Bond or Le Carre offering, ""Bridge of Spies"" is not that kind of story.","

An American lawyer, James Donovan, takes on his case but, faced with overwhelming evidence and a biased judge, loses the case. Abel is sentenced to 30 years in jail and Donovan's Supreme Court appeal fails. Just then Francis Gary Powers, the ""U-2 Spy"", is shot down over Russia and captured. Now Donovan becomes the negotiator in a potential prisoner swap...Interesting story, especially as it is largely true and involves a very well-known historic event - the U-2 Spy. The negotiations and brinkmanship towards the end are quite intriguing.However, feels clumsy, idealistic and, at times, contrived. The first part of the movie deals very heavy-handedly with Abel's trial. The character of Donovan also seems too goody-two-shoesy to be the real Donovan.Certainly not Steven Spielberg's best direction - far from it. The movie seems to lack engagement and what there is is overly contrived and sentimental. Plus I quite quickly got irritated with his over- use of the last image of one scene being a segue to a new, unrelated, scene. Just felt very cheesy and amateurish.Being a Steven Spielberg film, we have Tom Hanks in the lead role. He puts in a fairly solid performance. Mark Rylance got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Abel. Not sure why - he doesn't have that much dialogue and his screen time is fairly limited too.","

This is a film that has that instant feeling you just love it and you're watching something truly special. And its a true story, and i'm a sucker for true stories.The story its another great lesson to be learned by humanity, and the screenplay does an outstanding job telling it. It has all the ingredients Spielberg is known for, the hope in humanity, the believe in the mans power to change the course of history for the good, the true selfless, and so on. The cast is beyond perfect, and everyone gives amazing performances, but of course Tom Hanks steals the show, he gives one of his most likable performances, in the end the character helps a lot. Its just a bigger than life character which fits like a glove in Tom Hanks. The other characters are also amazing, but the one that stands the most to me, even if hes not the one to appear the most, is the Russian spy (Mark Rylance) hes just one of those characters that his so unique and likable that is amazing.The production values are just top notch as one would expect from a Spielberg film. The visuals are hauntingly beautiful and perfectly illustrate the feel of the cold war. The film is amazingly shot, there's a scene with an aircraft that is breathtaking. The special effects are perfect. The production design is bound to be nominated for an Oscar, special attention to the Berlin settings. The score is another hit for Thomas Newman, though the film has this amazing atmosphere were there's very little score and the one there is is mainly in the final minutes. This gives a very authentic and realistic feeling to the film, its like you are really rgere. Thats why i was surprised that the length of the score is almost 50 minutes! Overall the film has a lot in common with Lincoln, its really the perfect follower to that amazing picture. This is one of those films where you just get lost in the story, it's a very immersive film, a true masterpiece thats bound to get a ton of nominations from the academy.","

"Bridge of Spies","Troy_Campbell","26 October 2015","Spielberg, Hanks, Coen Brothers. Rarely have there been so many members of the Hollywood royal family working together on a single motion picture. With this calibre of talent involved the expectations are unsurprisingly sky high; unfortunately this Cold War true story lands in the 'good, but not good enough' category and subsequently feels like a missed opportunity. At first it's difficult to pinpoint why the spark is missing as all the ingredients for an old-school espionage yarn are present, but after careful contemplation it seems to me that Spielberg may be going through the motions. His direction is purposely understated to be sure, although there is a distinct lack of oomph in his narrative propulsion that is strangely un-Spielbergian. There's also never any real sense of Hanks' American attorney being in danger, despite spending large chunks of time in war-torn Berlin liaising with shadowy Russian diplomats and volatile German soldiers. Nevertheless, this thriller predominantly satisfies thanks to another heartfelt performance from main man Hanks. His put upon lawyer is righteous but grounded, intelligent but humble, fearful but optimistic, all with a welcome dash of wit. In fact it's the Brooklyn-set first act that proves the most entertaining, when it's mostly a two-hander between Hanks and Mark Rylance's dryly-humorous Russian spy, the latter damn near stealing the show right from under Hanks' nose. With regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski on hand as director of photography, the movie looks utterly spectacular too, the glowing courtrooms of New York just as impressive as the snowy streets of a war-ravaged Germany. Bridge of Spies is a solid Cold War thriller with a compelling protagonist, yet with the Tinseltown heavyweights involved I can't help but think it's also somewhat of a disappointment.","

"Bridge of Spies","Hitchcoc","19 October 2015","It's always a bit dangerous to do historical drama, especially when things are within the memories of living people. This is the story of a prisoner exchange involving a Russian spy and U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, whose spy plane was shot down by said Russians. Instead of a series of scenes of weapons fire and close calls, this is a very cerebral movie. Tom Hanks, in sort of an Atticus Finch mode, puts aside the furor of the nation and potential threats to his family, to follow the course of justice. He finds himself dealing with those who must cater to their nations positions in world politics. He also must act without sanction from his own country. Next to Hanks, Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel steals much of the movie. I'm sure some liberties were taken with facts along the way to make it more Hollywood, but this did nothing to diminish a real view of what the Cold War was like. And, yes, I remember ""Duck and cover!""","

"Bridge of Spies","eddie_baggins","26 October 2015","Like the master-craftsman of his art that he is, Steven Spielberg just keeps on producing the goods. Sure his films may include the likes of 1942 and the last misguided Indiana Jones movie outing, but for someone that's directed 31 feature films its incredible there's not an absolute stinker in a career that's spaned in excess of 50 years. Where Bridge of Spies might rank among the bearded hat wearing gurus career however can only be decided by time but there's little doubt this cold war thriller is an absolute treat of cinematic produce.Tense, taut and most tellingly, meticulously shot and edited, Spies is quite possibly Spielberg's finest film in a decade.Working with his usual and trusted production crew including D.O.P Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn (sadly John Williams doesn't score Spies, perhaps he was busy in a galaxy far far away?), Spies really does see Spielberg achieve fantastic overall results, especially from his team up with writers Joel and Ethan Coen who were bought in to touch up Matt Charman's original script.While it's not got the heart of Spielberg's most revered films like E.T, Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan or the pure spectacle of ventures like Jaws or Minority Report, it's still clear Spielberg had a blast creating this thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat almost entirely through its scripting and construction. Spies in many ways feels cut from the same cloth as Spielberg's Munich, just much more tightly focused.In recent times Spielberg may've achieved good if not stunning outcomes in tales like Lincoln and War Horse but Spies is just a purely unbridled joy led by yet another great Spielberg directed performance of Tom Hanks.Himself experiencing good not incredible films of recent times, Spies allows Hanks to once more display the everyman American that's driven his career and his hardworking lawyer that really just wants a good night's sleep, James B. Donovan, will here go down as one of his all times best.His the star of the ensemble, Spielberg allowing him a showing in almost every scene and Hanks nails it. Delivering just like the film around him does, seemingly with the ease of the ticking of a clocks second hand.Put simply, a near faultless production that lacks ever so slightly some true emotional punches or set pieces that would've made it a 5 star masterpiece, Bridge of Spies is yet again further reminder to all as to why Spielberg is the true movie making king and this is a film that will likely see him and his crew seriously contend at the next Oscar ceremony.Bridge of Spies is without question a definite much watch for all cinema lovers.4 ½ American breakfast's out of 5","

"Bridge of Spies","SnoopyStyle","18 April 2016","It's 1957 Brooklyn. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested for being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is pushed to defend him. Despite popular pressure, Donovan fights to prevent Abel's execution. When U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers is shoot down over the Soviet Union, CIA director Allen Dulles recruits Donovan to test out the prisoner exchange idea as a private citizen. American student Frederic Pryor gets imprisoned on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. Donovan decides to hold out for both Americans' release.Director Steven Spielberg delivers a well-made movie. However, there is a lack of tension for most of the movie. Spielberg needs to ramp up the danger to Donovan. He needs to gin up more danger to his job and to his family. The shooting into his house is fine. I expected a scene of his wife getting confronted. Having said that, other scenes seem too heavy-handed especially the last few scenes back home. Spielberg is also putting in too much of a glare which gives the movie a dreamy quality. Instead, it needs a darker, harsher, and scarier tone. Tom Hanks is a bit too calm. He needs to be scared in more times. The time he's confronted by the street youths in East Berlin is a prime example. It needs to be shocking and it needs to come out of nowhere. Instead, it's laid out before it happens and it's a source of comedy afterward. The tension is never too high. It could have been a darker, scarier scene.","

"Bridge of Spies","Leofwine_draca","25 January 2018","I always find Spielberg a hit-and-miss director; for every winning thriller like MUNICH there's a piece of tat like INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL to come along and reduce the director's stature in my eyes. Thankfully, BRIDGE OF SPIES is one of his mature films, which translates into talkiness which is never boring thanks to a very strong script that recalls great Cold War thrillers like THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. Tom Hanks is once again a likeable, quick-thinking everyman who this time around is tasked with defending a Russian spy in the courts. I remember despising Mark Rylance's WOLF HALL when I attempted watching it, but Rylance is at the top of his game here and extremely likeable as the self-effacing spy. The film's true story origins means it has the ring of authenticity throughout and Spielberg admirably avoids sentimentality, instead presenting complex characters working their way through complicated situations. The end result is a film which delights from beginning to end.","

"Bridge of Spies","Prismark10","21 January 2017","Bridge of Spies is a pedestrian cold war drama that combines the talents of Steven Spielberg and the Coen brothers. It really is a literal title as the climax takes place on a bridge and it has spies.Tom Hanks plays an insurance lawyer. We are meant to root for him even though as he tries to stiff a personal injury lawyer. Remember folks, his insured driver injured five people but he wants to limit it as one claim.Hanks really has the hang of these types of characters now, sturdy, steady, steadfast with just a hint of overacting. He plays James Donovan who is called in to defend Rudolf Abel a captured KGB spy operating in the USA. He places his life at risk to save him from the death penalty, being astute enough to realise that Abel may become useful in later years. So it does when the Russians capture a U-2 spy plane pilot. Donovan then has to put his personal safety at risk by going to East Germany to negotiate a spy swap.The film features a critically acclaimed performance from Mark Rylance who plays Abel and won a best supporting actor Oscar. Rylance is an example of a subtle, understated performance.Spielberg is a master craftsman but the film is just too cumbersome and stuffy. It never has the labyrinthic thrills of a John Le Carre story. There is some wonderful art direction but the film really needed some zap.","

"Bridge of Spies","classicsoncall","13 June 2016","This is a compelling character study set amid the espionage and drama of the Cold War between America and the Soviets. What really got my attention was when part of James Donovan's (Tom Hanks) argument against the death penalty for Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) relied largely on foreseeing the day when an American might be arrested on similar charges, and a live prisoner might be the key to an exchange. Cold War paranoia is more than evident in the early part of the story, Donovan's own son asks him, ""You're not a Communist, so why are you defending one""? It's not made clear how much Donovan's pressure impacted the judge in sentencing Abel, who early on insisted this was an open and shut case, with Donovan's court strategy merely window dressing. I was surprised how little time was offered for Francis Gary Powers' (Austin Stowell) role in the film, but that apparently was not the emphasis of the story. I was only six years old when these events unfolded but somehow (amazingly) can recall Powers' name in headlines of the day.There's always a question about historical accuracy with films like this, but that shouldn't sway one's interest in seeing the picture. The story is gripping and does a good job in demonstrating Donovan's resolve to protect his client's rights while remaining faithful to the principles of the Constitution. His reaction to East Germans being shot at the Berlin Wall attempting to escape was an unsubtle reminder that even though the events depicted occurred over a half century ago, they still resonate strongly with viewers who were alive at the time.","

What it definitely is true, is the fact that the movie takes its time to tell the (true) story behind it all. While Spielberg probably took some liberties (as almost every filmmaker does when they tackle a true life story/incident), this is very interesting and tense stuff.Though you wouldn't know when looking at the main character (besides the one Tom Hanks is playing), because of him underplaying everything. Was the real person like that? Haven't read much about that, but the movie may take a couple of people to take a look into that. And for that, the movie achieved what it wanted: Putting a spotlight on something not many are aware of. Spielberg and Kaminsky always deliver when it comes to settings/camera of course, acting is great too, so it's kind of a ""no-brainer""","

"Bridge of Spies","Quietb-1","19 October 2015","Here's a bloated lack of action full of talk from the Director of some really great movies. If you know the story you know the outcome. If you don't know the story you know nothing bad will happen to Tom Hanks. Maybe a John Williams score could have helped this but he didn't get the job. The movie is too long. It takes a long time getting going and you'll be looking at your watch wondering when is something going to happen.If you like 1956 and 1957 Chevrolets this movie is for you. The car is everywhere including East Berlin and even at the bridge in the title. It looks like the same 1956 car appears in different locations in the first sequence. You know a movie is not captivating if you are looking for product placement or movie cars.A couple of good performances make this bearable. There is a scene near the end where the kids call their mother into the room to watch the news story. Seems odd that they knew what was coming and laughable they would call in their parents.The Janusz Kaminski Cinematography looks good on the big screen. Maybe if you lower your expectations you won't be too disappointed. Looking for a great Spielberg movie skip this and watch ""Jaws"" ""Munich"" ""Schindler's List"" ""Raiders"" or almost anything but ""Lincoln"".","

"Bridge of Spies","ElMaruecan82","17 February 2016","In the midst of the Cold War paranoia, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) a lawyer specialized in insurance settlement is assigned to defend KGB spy Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance in a performance that will deserve a few words. This is less a trial than a tactic to prevent the Soviet Union to politically exploit Abel's arrest: Abel's case must show the world that USA treated him democratically. But that's only a cover, what Donovan ignores. Like so many characters who populated Hanks' filmography, Donovan is a decent man and much more, a professional. He takes his job seriously and when he discovers that much of the evidence was found without search warrants, he even wants to call a vice of form.So, what we get is a highly respected lawyer, with an Irish name, a respectable family, and a 'Red' who might have pulled a Rozenberg in his actions and be the cause of New York's imminent nuking, in the minds of millions of Americans or kids, constantly brainwashed by these Nuclear mushroom images (you know these 'duck and cover' programs). Naturally, Abel's public image inevitably spills over Donovan who worries everyone from his family to his colleagues, from the prosecutors to the judge, and his zeal doesn't help. That, alone, would have been the premise of a terrific movie, the contradiction of a man who does his job, out of decency and patriotism and is almost treated like a traitor. To think that there were supposed to counter-attack the Russian propaganda is one of these film's many subtle delights and it doesn't come as a surprise, that within this whole paranoid craze, you have these two men who seem to speak the same language.It is not a friendship in the cinematic sense of the word, but it's a story of respect between two men who know the context they live in, their duty, their limitations, but still, find a 'bridge' of communication, through such simple matters as honor, principles and humanity. Rylance's performance looks like a one-note one, but don't get mislead, this is a man who was trained not to show any emotions, to keep a low-profile, so it's only through his eye-language, and a few words, that you can get to the core of his feelings. He says he's not afraid of the electric chair, but his stoicism is later counterbalanced by the 'although it wouldn't be my first choice'. This is not some robotic spy, this is a human being who's also caught in the requirements of his job. And his attitude, if not the public's, earns him Donovan's everlasting sympathy.Tom Hanks, as usual, doesn't need to speak loudly his emotions, we can see that from the way he exchanges looks with Rylance, and after Abel's sentence, he pleads to Supreme Court arguing that there's no way, the USA should treat dishonorably a man who's only following a fighter's code the same way that America wished his men would follow the Constitution. There has to be a reciprocity of actions and treatments, not just in the weapon department. And what could have been a terrific climactic speech is only the precursor of the second act of the movie. Of course, there was no way, Abel would be found innocent, he wasn't anyway, so the film had to move to higher levels, and it does.It's interesting that Donovan worked in insurance, this is a man who made a living out of predicting odds, and in 1957, it didn't take the highest insurance exec to guess one American spy might be arrested once, and Abel could be used as a bargaining chip. His eloquence convinces the judge and Abel escapes from the Rozenberg treatment, and of course, it pays off, as a spy pilot, Gary Michael Powers, is shut down while traveling above the Soviet territory on U-21 plane. Donovan is then entrusted to negotiate the exchange of prisoners, which would've been a formality if it wasn't for a little twist: the arrest of an American student in Berlin while attempting to get his girlfriend to the West Side. When Donovan learns about this arrest, he can't imagine going back to America with only one person. The film turns into a very interesting chess game where Donovan must hit two birds with one stone, he must convince the Soviet and the East-German representatives, understand their motives, express his, and make the timing his ally, rather than an obstacle. It's a heart-pounding race against the clock.Although Steven Spielberg isn't renowned for being the most subtle director when it comes to emotions, his recent ""Lincoln"" was a signal that the tone of his movies abandoned their usual sentimentalism to some more mature material. Lincoln was less the noble-hearted hero than a positively Machiavellian tactician, and this is what Donovan is. And he plays the diplomatic game perfectly, learning how to be mild-mannered or firmly resolved, in the middle of a Cold War that wasn't just symbolically cold. This leads to a wonderful climax, whose first element of surprise is to reveal that the film's title wasn't just a metaphor.Now, I read many comments accusing the film of being another propaganda movie. I would say it's more of Capra-like movie in its spirit. Besides, wasn't Abel the most fascinating character of the movie, and a hero to some extent? Weren't the Americans as eager to hang Abel as a Western mob to lynch a cattle thief, and didn't one of the CIA guys even care of the American student? In fact, ""Bridge of Spies"" is beyond these considerations, it is less a thriller with two antagonistic sides, than a great character study with two similar men united by their patriotism and their sense of duty. And no matter how different the lifestyles are, two systems making such men possible can't be that bad.","

"Bridge of Spies","gavin6942","24 January 2016","During the Cold War, an American lawyer (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.The film is nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (for Rylance), Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay. Let us address those in reverse order.There is no doubt the screenplay is strong, and another feather in the caps of the Coen brothers. Whether or not you consider it to be ""best"" probably comes down to one thing: do you prefer a good story or do you prefer historical accuracy? If you prefer historical accuracy, you are going to have qualms with this picture because Donovan (Hanks) is very false. He is portrayed as an insurance attorney rather than the intelligence operative he was, and he is shown as the victim of multiple acts of violence, which he was not. So that will be an automatic hangup for some people who frown on dramatic exaggeration and poetic license.If one looks at it a bit more forgivingly, though, it is an incredible script that covers the Constitution, the Cold War, the interaction of various governments and their agents... it tells the story of one attorney defending a despicable client because it is the right thing to do (a la ""To Kill a Mockingbird"") and the better-known tale of Gary Powers and the U-2 spy plane. Is it sensationalized? Somewhat. A little melodramatic with its patriotism? Yes. But still a darn fine story, and whether a winner or not, clearly a strong contender for best screenplay.How about production design? This one is a bit of a challenge. The work that went into this film is incredible, bringing everything on screen back to the 1950s and 1960s. Every car, every outfit, and even the most inconsequential detail had to be touched. How you compare this to the futuristic sets of ""Mad Max"" or the science-driven world of ""The Martian"", who knows? It is like comparing apples and oranges. While ""Bridge of Spies"" will probably not carry this category, those who worked on securing all the necessary scenery deserve top honors.The supporting actor category is where ""Bridge of Spies"" has its best chance of winning an award. Mark Rylance is not an actor whose work I am familiar with, because he has primarily distinguished himself on the stage. So it is hard to say how much he is going outside of his normal range here. But he gives us an interesting character. While ""best actors"" are often intense or pushed to their limits, Rylance is quite the opposite: subtle and understated. But it makes fora powerful, compelling nemesis you cannot help but like in some way. He would be deserving of the award.Which leaves us with best picture. And the short answer is no, this is not a contender. The nomination makes sense, but the film never seems to hit all cylinders. Although nothing is lacking, it still feels somehow incomplete. ""Bridge of Spies"" is not the film of the year, nor is it among Spielberg's best.","

However, it was so slow moving that if it was not for the director name and Tom Hanks I would have walked out of it. Yes, you read that correctly. There was really nothing moving about the movie and the over saturated directing made it even worse. The main few events were played over and over so much that the end of the story felt blaise. Great material and wonderful that it is a true story but it was the most shallow slow moving boring docudrama and I love history but I would not recommend or waste any money on this movie.

"Bridge of Spies","rmax304823","1 July 2016","In the early 50s, the quiet, middle-aged amateur artist, Walter Abel is arrested. He's a Soviet spy. Tom Hanks is appointed to defend him but it's all supposed to be pro forma. Hanks is supposed to wave the fourth amendment, mention due process and protection from search and seizure, then sit down and shut up. But he takes his job as defense counsel seriously and nobody likes it. He can't possibly get Abel off but still he's defending a Russky espionage agent. Everyone is anxious to see this guy get the chair. It was disheartening to see that the director has Hanks sitting on a subway at this point while all the strap hangers are reading about the trial in the newspapers and glare at him. The reason it's disheartening is that such a scene surely never happened in real life. Who the hell knows what Abel's defense attorney looked like -- or if they had seen photos of him, would recognize the innocent Hanks sitting on a subway train. And another reason that it's disheartening is that the director doesn't trust the audience to know what's already been made clear -- Hanks is ill thought of because he's defending a hated enemy. Really, earlier scenes in court and at Hanks' home have made that very clear.The judge is eager to hang Abel too, but Hanks, an insurance lawyer, visits the judge at home and points out that if Abel is put in prison instead of the graveyard, the U. S. will have a little something in its back pocket to trade in case something similar happens to one of our agents in Moscow. Just in case, you know, kind of like an insurance policy. The judge is convinced and Abel gets thirty years, much to the anger of the public at large. While the two sit quietly in the visiting room listening to Shostakovitch, Able remarks, not unkindly, that Hanks ""should be careful"", and in fact a couple of bullets are fired through the windows of his home. When he loses his appeal to the Supreme Court, it's back to the insurance business for Hanks. He's summarily snubbed.Meanwhile, however, there has been a parallel story. The CIA has developed the super-secret U-2, a spy plane whose service altitude is 70,000 feet. That's pretty high up, out of the range of known Soviet missiles. But then, as Leo Strauss has pointed out, there are ""unknown unknowns"" and one of them is that Soviet missiles can bring down an airplane at 70,000 feet, which they duly do. The pilot, Francis Gary Powers, has been instructed to destroy both himself and the airplane if it should be brought down in Russian territory but he's unable to do either. The Soviets get both prizes and make the most of their exploit in the media, embarrassing president Dwight D. Eisenhower who at first claimed no knowledge of the spying. (This detail isn't in the movie.) Powers is tried and given ten years in a Soviet prison. Ugh.Hanks is given the job of arranging a prisoner exchange in East Berlin, all on his own. His mission is to trade Abel for Powers and another guy, Pryor, a graduate student from Yale who was detained for no particular reason. Again, it's not mentioned in the movie but John F. Kennedy was president at the time and Hanks' character had his full backing except that Kennedy, a Harvard man, said he ""wouldn't bust his *** getting a Yale man out."" The CIA cares nothing at all about Pryor. They only want to get Powers back, although they all hate him for having survived. The fact that Powers has suffered in an East German prison and kept awake for extended periods to squeeze information out of him means nothing to the CIA. In the end, due to Hanks' determination, the swap is accomplished after much bureaucratic haggling, and both Americans are released, while Abel is sent back to his family.Good stuff. Nice photography and visual f/x. The scene of Powers' U-2 being shot down is thrilling. Tom Hanks brings an unusual edginess to the role of the central figure. He's jumpy, nervous, speaks rapidly, paces. Think of Gregory Peck. Now think of the opposite, except for the concordant confidence. As James B. Donovan, Hanks has a wife and two lovely kiddies. The kids are a little cute, but Hanks' wife, Amy Ryan, is just about right. She's pretty without being Hollywood gorgeous. And she doesn't provide unconditional support, nor does she nag. Nice job of writing. The standout performance is by Mary Rylance as Rudolf Abel. Rylance gives us a wimpy little spy, wily, artistic, unflappable. He's taciturn and when he speaks it's with a Scottish accent and what he says is keenly perceptive. It's never slow because with the exception of Abel, all the character speak quickly, as in a thirty-second TV commercial. At time it felt as if the camera were undercranked.The director, Spielberg, could easily have ruined the film by turning Hanks into a brave and resolute hero instead of a guy who insists on playing by the rules, who is anxious to get home and go to bed, who is frightened when cornered by some German kids who demand his warm coat in the middle of winter. Abel could have been turned into a stereotypical Russian spy, bald, ugly, and snarling defiantly. Instead of being snubbed after his return, Francis Gary Powers might have been hailed as a proud representative of Uncle Sam and given a ticker tape parade. And so on until we're not watching an adult movie but a children's cartoon.","

Fact-based and liberties taken in this fact-bound story. Thrill and suspense driven almost documentary-style drama that takes place during the height of the Cold War in 1960. An American U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary powers is downed by the Soviets. And a KGB mole Rudolf Abel is captured in New York in 1957.Hanks plays James Donovan, a Brooklyn insurance claims lawyer that just happens to be a former Nuremburg trial prosecutor is picked to negotiate a trade with the USSR. The transfer of spies is to be made on the Glienicke Bridege that links West Berlin with Potsdam. If things aren't exactly trustworthy at first, Donovan on his own initiative wants to pull in a third man into the swap.

"Bridge of Spies","richardchatten","20 March 2022","Mark Rylance's laconic Colonel Abel (improbably but authentically speaking English with a Scots accent) lies at the heart of this drama; but Tom Hawks being the bigger star dominates the footage and accounts for the film's whopping running time.Had this story actually been filmed in 1960 it would have been terser and in black & white; over fifty years later Steven Spielberg bathes it in a nostalgic glow with Edward Hopper lighting and '77 Sunset Strip' on the telly and 'Spartacus' at the pictures.In the light of current events in the Ukraine it's sympathetic portrayal of a Russkie might raise eyebrows (particularly as Abel in one scene praises Shostakovich, who'd been given an extremely hard time by the very regime he served); but the incredible heroism shown only last week by Marina Ovsyannikova is a salutary reminder that not all Russians are monsters.","

The Master Filmmaker has handled this historical dramatic thriller, without one single fault. Janusz Kamiński's Cinematography is picture-perfect. Michael Kahn's Editing is razor-crisp. Thomas Newman's Score is superb (Although its strange not to hear John Williams's musical genius here, since he's a Spielberg regular). Art & Costume Design are efficient.Performance-Wise: Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan, is commanding, as ever. The Screen Legend ignites the proceedings, with magnetic energy. Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel, is the scene-stealer. He enacts the spy in question, magnificently. And the on-screen chemistry between Hanks & Rylance, is enviable. Amy Ryan as Mary McKenna Donovan, does well. Alan Alda as Thomas Watters, is impeccable, as always. Austin Stowell as Francis Gary Powers, leaves a mark.

The time period, cold war, Tom Hanks, the stars were aligned. I will start with this notion, Spielberg's movies are always well acted, always well shot and always beautifully scored. Bridge of Spies does not fail this standard. There are clearly some remarkable acting performances. It wouldn't be a surprise to see some trophies handed out for this work. The director got what he needed, superb acting. The actors did not get what they need, superb story telling. It is the only thing missing here but it's a biggie. If you know anything about the real life story of James Donovan you could easily imagine a truly exciting movie. The opening credit sequence included this line...Based on Real Events. This disclaimer gives license to the director to ""Hollywood up"" the story. So basically there are no excuses. In Munich, the director pealed your sole with great story telling, tension and acting. Bridge of Spies had that potential, at least, that's what I was expecting. Tension was left out of this movie for some reason. I theorize Spielberg did this intensionally. Why? Somebody should ask him.","

"Bridge of Spies","KineticSeoul","26 June 2016","So this is a talking movie, with a LOT of talking going around without much action. Actually there is almost no action at all. So if you are looking forward to watching a action movie with spies going on espionage and trying to assassinate people, this isn't that kind of movie. When it comes to talking movies, the story, the dialogue and the performances has to take center stage. And this movie has all three of those elements without it going to a very convoluted and overly political direction. So most mainstream audiences will understand what is going on, on screen. However for me, what made this movie really work is Steven Spielberg classic direction. Where the premise is uplifting while having a sense of humanity. The cinematography really does have the tenacity to keep audiences like me focused for the most part. This is a historical film that is based on a true story. So the plot is about James B. Donovan played by Tom Hanks who is a lawyer that takes on the task of defending a soviet spy. And the negotiation and what goes behind the scenes of the American and Soviet politics. It delves into humanity and the will power to stand up for what is right, although a lot of people will resent you for it.

"Bridge of Spies","Thanos_Alfie","6 February 2016","""Bridge of Spies"" is a Drama movie which tells the story of lawyer James B. Donovan who is entrusted to negotiate the release of an American pilot from Soviet Union in exchange a captive Soviet KGB spy who is held by the United States.I liked this movie a lot due to the fact that first of all is based on something that happened in reality and secondly because of the plot of it. In addition to this the cast of this movie was selected very nice with Tom Hanks who played as the lawyer James B. Donovan to make a very good interpretation. Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was made by Mark Rylance who played as Rudolf Abel the Soviet spy. The direction of Steven Spielberg for one more time was exceptional and this can be seen very easily in the whole duration of the movie.Finally I believe that ""Bridge of Spies"" is a very good movie to watch and is a lesson for everyone because it represents and shows the difficulty of the job that this lawyer took over and how the choices that he made affect him but his family too.","

"Bridge of Spies","adarshbohra69","6 October 2015","Hanks gives a very satisfying, watchable and assured performance, with just the right amount of hokum, homely and wily in judiciously balanced proportions,Because this is Hanks we're dealing with, audiences know what to expect. it's terrific craftsmanship, pure storytelling gusto and that Midas- touch ability to find grounds for optimism everywhere, Steven Spielberg has dramatised a true-life cold war spy-swap drama, starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. Those brought up on John Le Carré might perhaps expect from this moral equivalence, shabby compromise and exhausted futility. But Spielberg, with his gift for uncynicism, uncovers decency and moral courage amidst all the Realpolitik. He works from an excellent screenplay by up-and-coming British dramatist Matt Charman, a script punched up in recognisable places by Joel and Ethan Coen.","

"Bridge of Spies","lesleyharris30","19 July 2016","Bridge of Spies is a stellar movie with a very well developed plot and a magnificent cast. We are almost immediately taken in to the drama and intensity of this true story from the very beginning, as we follow an insurance lawyer who is tasked with defending a Soviet spy who has betrayed his country. We manage to gain support from the spy as we see his point of view, beautifully captured by the great Steven Spielberg. On the other hand, I did feel that it did not give us enough insight on the seriousness of the Cold War. There is a scene where Donovan views a bunch of people being shot down while travelling on a train, I would like to to have seen more of this, to emphasise the struggles this movie is dealing with. The performances are the highlight of it all, Tom Hanks is breathtaking as the lead role, James Donovan, perfectly conveying the transformation of an everyday lawyer turned hero, and Mark Rylance delivers a well deserved Oscar win as Rudolf Abel, a flawed, conflicted character who we can not help but support as a result of Rylance's charm. Terrificly acted, superb direction and a great script, Bridge of Spies is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. An insurance lawyer is tasked with defending a Soviet spy, a job that ends up stretching far beyond the courtroom. Best Performance: Tom Hanks / Worst Performance: Alan Alda","

"Bridge of Spies","cosmo_tiger","31 January 2016","""What's the next move when you don't know what the game is."" James B. Donovan (Hanks) is an insurance lawyer who has been chosen to defend a Russian accused of being a spy. He manages to make the entire country, including his firm, upset with him by the time the trial is over. After a US pilot is captured the US wants to facilitate an exchange of prisoners. Once again Donovan is enlisted to help, but his plans are different than what the government wants. First thing, this is a great movie. I really enjoyed this and was entertained by it the entire time. I will say there isn't a lot of action in this and the movie really had the feel of Lincoln. To me that's not a bad thing but just a heads up. Hanks is good as usual and really brings compassion to this role. The fact that this is based on true events makes the movie that much more exciting and tense. This is a movie that I highly recommend, but again may not be for everyone. Overall, Hanks and Spielberg hit another home run. For a history buff like me this was one of the best movies of the year. I give this a B+.","

"Bridge of Spies","stevendbeard","16 October 2015","I saw ""Bridge of Spies"", starring Tom Hanks-Saving Mr. Banks, Captain Phillips; Mark Rylance-The Gunman, The Other Boleyn Girl; Alan Alda-The Blacklist_tv, What Women Want and Amy Ryan-Goosebumps, Escape Plan.This is based on a true story that takes place in 1957. Steven Spielberg directs this cold war story about a Soviet spy captured on American soil, Mark, who is arrested and asked to move into one of our fine prison establishments, or maybe even be executed for treason. Tom plays a New York lawyer that is convinced by the C.I.A. to represent Mark-they think they should show the world that even a dirty Soviet spy deserves a good defense. Alan plays Tom's boss and agrees with the C.I.A. and tells Tom to go ahead and take the job. Around this same time, an American pilot, Francis Gary Powers, is shot down over Soviet air space, while taking reconnaissance pictures from a U2 spy plane at 70,000 feet. The C.I.A. wants Tom to negotiate a prisoner exchange with Mark for the pilot. Since Tom has to go to Germany for the talks, and it is as the wall is being built in Berlin so it is dangerous, Tom tells his wife, Amy, that he is going on a fishing trip-he doesn't want her to worry. The exchange of prisoners is to take place on a bridge between East Berlin and West Berlin, so that is where the title of the movie, Bridge of Spies, comes from. It is a good story-what else do you expect from a Steven Spielberg movie?-but light on action. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a good rental.","

"Bridge of Spies","bryank-04844","14 October 2015","The year 2015 gives us yet another Tom Hanks/Steven Spielberg movie called 'Bridge of Spies' with an added bonus of the Coen Bros. serving as co-writers. Now with a cast and crew like this, I expect something that would live on forever and win all the awards come award season. That's not really the case here though, as Spielberg's recent directorial efforts have been lacking a bit. I'm not saying they're bad, I'm just saying that 'War Horse' and 'Lincoln' were long, slow, dreary period pieces with no real momentum, despite some awards and critical acclaim.That being said, I bet any of you a hundred king-size Snicker's bars that you haven't watch or even thought of those two films since they were released. This all could be said about 'Bridge of Spies', which is of course, well made, interesting, fun, and well-acted, but really only worth one viewing and no more. Once it ends, you'll immediately forget about it and start thinking of Spielberg's next project, which a return to the sci-fi arena with 'Ready Player One'. I'm of the mindset that all of Spielberg's movies are worthy of unlimited viewings, no matter what time of day or night it is.It's just unfortunate that 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of those instances. All that being said, 'Bridge of Spies' is technically top notch with Tom Hanks giving another good performance. Set during the height of the Cold War, a soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is caught in New York City and put to trial unjustly. Meanwhile, the US sent some new U-2 spy planes do to take some images of Mother Russia, where one plane was shot down over the Soviet Union, where the pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) survived the crash and was captured and put in prison.Back in Brooklyn, lawyer James B. Donovan (Hanks) was forced to defend the Russian spy they caught and make sure he had a fair trial, but with the new information, he is tasked to try and make a deal to release the spies back into their country's custody. A trade off if you will. From here, Donovan has to weave in and out of high level Russian buildings, as he tries to broker a deal, which if not executed correctly, could have started a major war. There are plenty of Spielberg-ian moments to be had, which is always nice to see and Hanks's performance again is solid, however not on par with some of his previous work.The script is tight and to the point, but there isn't really any guts or memorable moments in this film. It plays for a good two and a half hours, all of which are mildly entertaining, but in the end, it's completely forgettable, which is unfortunate, because you have Spielberg, Hanks, and the Coen Bros. here.Worth a Look!","

"Bridge of Spies","gest1969","8 January 2016","I am a Cold War child, born in a country which did have common borders with a Warsaw Pact member but was never a target of thermonuclear destruction. I was still at primary school when I came across a couple of serialized excerpts from Powers' memoir. He really caught my imagination. I saw ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" and ""Across the Bridge"" (with Rod Steiger), films in which the bridge is both the passage and the frontier, a no-man's land in which destinies can be decided in a split second of hesitation or bad luck.Bridge of Spies was a great disappointment. Cars and costumes were fine but the spirit and the people of the era was absent. I don't understand why, when I think of ""Munich"" or ""Schindler's List"", when there are so many novels to consult for the atmosphere and so many memoirs to consult for the facts. Why was Powers pictured with such unkind shallowness? Why were CIA men and DDR functionaries such caricatures? No matter how great Mark Rylance was, where was the motivation and the ideology of the Soviet spy? Where were the political leaders of the two superpowers? How did the little lawyer from the Bronx become such a cool operative behind the lines, from one day to the other, without experiencing any fear or trepidation?There is nothing wrong with high morals or nostalgia in cinema but when a film tries to portray an episode from a complex political and ideological conflict serving only these ingredients, then I can only be disappointed at the waste of means and opportunities. Pity.","

"Bridge of Spies","Reno-Rangan","14 February 2016","The movie that should have been made 50 years ago, but due to the international political tension it did not take off. So now it's here, the same director made it. It's a rocking combo, once again Spielberg and Hanks come together, tell me who's going to miss that. Simply spellbinding, one of the best movie of the year.I think this flick is for adults. There's no sex, no nudity, not even a single kiss or the bad language and zero violence, its fine for teens and kids can understand, but the story is what I meant that suits only for the grown ups. Like the usual, this Spielberg movie is easy to follow, there's no tricky twists and turns, but aimed for only the event that's based on the real.Over a 2 hour long negotiation drama with surrounded by suspense and thrills. It's completely a one man show and the end has been just like everybody wanted. I'm not surprised that it is nominated for the Oscars in the 6 categories including the best motion picture. I would be very happy if it puts at least a couple of trophies to its basket. I feel it is a must see if you're interested in WWII related subjects, other than the war.8½/10","

"Bridge of Spies","kgprophet","23 October 2015","Although this is an exceptional story that enjoys examining the minutia of the period, the story arc as a whole does not really offer anything new. This leaves the performances as the primary appeal for the film. Tom Hanks has proved himself as the Average Joe of this generation. Then again, I never felt he was really in peril at any point in the film, perhaps because of his role in Captain Phillips or even Saving Private Ryan. In those films he was an Average Joe who nevertheless had the courage to face violence when necessary. One of my favourite films with Tom Hanks starring is Road To Perdition. Because that was also a period piece, sometimes I felt I was watching the mafia character he portrayed. The most standout performance is Mark Rylance playing Abel, the Soviet spy caught in the U.S. He certainly could get an Oscar nod for a supporting actor.The story rolls along well enough, the longer length of the film comes from the fact that two stories are told. First is the capture and conviction of Abel in America. The second story follows the downing of Francis Powers and the setup of the exchange. I think some places to condense the exchange story could have brought the film back closer to a more appropriate two hours. Why? Well, I forgave Spielberg for the longer running time in Lincoln, because that film also had such a large cast to flesh out, and most of those characters were the real attraction in that film. Here, time is spent with Hanks visiting many East German characters that aren't particularly noteworthy, along with a few side trips that ultimately slow the momentum.One thing that has become annoying is the one-note style of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. As usual, every scene has a washed out backlight. Spielberg is known for incorporating longer single-take shots that are well choreographed, traveling along with the momentum of the scene. Oddly, he is too constrained with that style, where I was hoping some dynamic camera-work would provide a unique perspective of some interesting locations. I can't say I totally disagree with that decision, other than when a dynamic shot occurs, such as one showing the sentencing of Francis Powers, it seems it is the only time the films shows any real visual energy. The music hits the right beats, but again, does not try to stand out in any way.I doubt general movie goers will embrace this movie. The subject matter will not really connect with anyone beyond those who enjoy period pieces like this. Hanks' character, unfortunately, has no Oscar moments to emote. The climax of the film also doesn't have any fireworks in the normal sense. I would recommend this film as a chance to get a glimpse of a piece of history you probably never knew before. But I would not really not call it one of the best films of the year, or a highlight of either Spielberg's or Hanks' career.","

"Bridge of Spies","leonblackwood","30 August 2016","Review: It's not very often that I can say a bad word about a Spielberg/Hanks collaboration but in this case, I have to say that I found this movie pretty boring. Although the subject matter was deep and emotional, I found the pace of the film, extremely slow and it just seemed to be going round in circles most of the time. Tom Hanks (James B. Donovan) and Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel) played there roles extremely well and they made the movie slightly watchable but I still struggled to keep my eyes open, through the negotiating scenes between Hanks, the Germans and the Russians. On the plus side, the whole look and feel of the film is top class and the period was filmed well by one of the best directors of all time but after the disappointing movie, War Horse, I was expecting more from this movie. The whole ""Russian Spy"" concept wasn't really shocking, even though it was based on true events, and the outcome of Donovan's actions was more interesting than the film. The fact that Abel was actually a spy, seemed to be overlooked and you don't get to see what problems his actions had caused in the past. Anyway, although the movie looked top class, I didn't really find it that entertaining and I won't be rushing to watch the movie again. Average! Round-Up: Steven Spielberg, 69, is one of those directors that people will flock to the cinemas to watch his movies, and when he teams up with Hanks, in movies like the Terminal, Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can, the collaboration usually works. To date, Spielbergs new movie, the BFG, has made $153million but it cost $140million to make so it has just about broken even. Its been a long time since this brilliant director has pulled off anything amazing but he will always be remembered for movies like Jaws, Close Encounters, the Indiana franchise, E.T., the Colour Purple, Jurassic Park etc. With another Indiana Jones and West Side Story, rumoured to be his next projects, I still find it quite surprising that he has only won 3 Oscars, 2 for Schindler's List and one for Saving Private Ryan but I'm sure he will get a lifetime achievement award for his contribution to cinema. His vision and amazing storytelling skills are truly unique but this film definitely wasn't one of his best. Tom Hanks has also gone a bit downhill lately but that is mostly due to the movies that he has chosen, and not his superb acting skills. Anyway, although I found this movie pretty boring, I'm sure that there is a market for this subject matter and it must have touched many hearts. Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $165million I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/history/thrillers, starring Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Domenick Lombardozzi, Brian Hutchison, Alan Alda and Amy Ryan. 5/10","

"Bridge of Spies","Horst_In_Translation","18 December 2015","""Bridge of Spies"" is the newest Steven Spielberg movie as of 2015 and once again Tom Hanks plays the main character in here. I was particularly curious about this film because I knew they were shooting here about a year ago and there is a lot of German background as the final crucial scene takes place here in Berlin. It is a pretty solid film by the books. Hanks is rock-solid as always and carries this film nicely, even if I would not go so far and say he is among the best performances this year. But he is not getting too much awards attention really, so it's fine I guess. The one getting tons of awards recognition is Mark Rylance, who is even considered a possible Academy Award winner in the supporting category. I thought he was decent, but I am not so sure if he was really that outstanding.Back to the film and away from the performances, this film is a decent watch for everybody with an interest in films about politics. It is set during the Cold War when a Russian spy gets caught and there is an exchange with an American soldier who was held captive in Russia. Most of the film is actually the preparation for this exchange and even the trial of Abel (the Russian spy played by Rylance), in which he faces the death penalty. In my opinion, the film was a bit sterile at times. I never felt any real emotions watching this. So it's not a bad film at all, but I felt the topic could have been dealt with maybe with a more personal approach. Spielberg's direction left me unattached mostly. It was interesting, yes, but I never felt really involved at any point and that is quite a shame as the topic certainly offers material of great emotion as well. Then again, this is a problem that is the case with many Spielberg films in my opinion, but that is just personal perception. I vaguely knew about the exchange, but I'm sure most Americans and non-Germans probably don't, especially the younger generation, which makes it even more informative.Finally, I recommend this movie. I am not too sure how accurate everything we see is and I am sure there are lots of additions for dramatic purpose, but that's not a problem at all. All films have such. And in the end, there is a reference about the main character's negotiations with Fidel Castro, which alone could be material enough for a complete film. I recommend watching ""Bridge of Spies"", even if it's nowhere near my personal favorites from 2015.","

"Bridge of Spies","alcorcrisan","19 December 2015","Mark Rylance stands out as the best reason to watch this movie. And, I feel tempted to say, the only reason to do so. His lines take the cream of the screenplay. I am quite a fan of spy movies. That is exactly why I find this to be extremely disappointing as a movie. Seeing Steven Spielberg's name come up at the final credits was a sort of cherry on the funeral cake. The direction and the editing are the two most disappointing elements of this production. Then parts of the story. It is all so predictable, so cliché, so déjà-vu. I happened to watch this film in the weeks in which the BBC broadcast a brilliant 5-part series entitled ""London Spy"". That is everything a spy-film fan can wish for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is everything but that. Underwhelming at best...","

"Bridge of Spies","ferguson-6","16 October 2015","Greetings again from the darkness. For a director, true power in the movie industry means you can obtain the financing and assemble the cast and crew you need to make the films that have meaning to you. With his 40 year career of unmatched combined box office and critical success, Steven Spielberg is the epitome of film power and the master of bringing us dramatized versions of historical characters and events. In his fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, Spielberg tells the story of James B Donovan.You say you aren't familiar with Mr. Donovan? In the late 1950's and early 1960's, the CIA (Allen Dulles was director at the time) persuaded James Donovan to provide a bit of Cold War legal service. Mr. Donovan was by trade an Insurance attorney, but after others in his profession passed on the ""opportunity"", his commitment to justice and human rights drove him to accept the challenge of defending suspected Russian spy named Rudolph Abel. In the face of an angry populace and government, Donovan took the case all the way to the Supreme Court – and his exact words are spoken in the movie by Hanks.Not long after, Francis Powers (played by Austin Stowell) was piloting a CIA U-2 spy plane when he was shot down over Russia and taken captive. This sequence in the film is breathtaking to watch. Enter James Donovan again  this time to negotiate an exchange of prisoners: Rudolph Abel for Francis Powers. It's these negotiations that provide the element of suspense in the story. Mr. Donovan was a family man, but he was also very confident in his ability to negotiate on the biggest stage and under the brightest spotlight (or darkest backroom).The movie is exactly what you would expect from a master filmmaker. Spielberg re-creates the era through sets, locations, and costumes. He utilizes his remarkable eye behind the camera, an interesting use of lighting, and the score from Thomas Newman. Nope, that's not a misprint. It's the first Spielberg movie in 30 years not scored by John Williams (who was unable to work on the project). Of course, the cast is stellar and it all starts with Tom Hanks. He just makes everything look so darn easy! Whether he is talking to his wife (Amy Ryan), his kids (including Bono's daughter Eve Hewson), his law partner (Alan Alda), or agents from the U.S. or Russia  Hanks manages to make each scene real and believable.It's the scenes between Donovan and Rudolph Abel that are the most fascinating to watch. Mark Rylance plays Abel, and to see these two men grow to respect each other for ""doing their job"" is a true acting and screen writing clinic. We find ourselves anxious for the next Rudolph Abel scene during an extended span where the focus is on Donovan's negotiations. When the two finally reunite, it's a quietly affecting moment where much is said with few words.Spielberg utilized many of the locations where the actual events took place, and this includes Berlin and the Glienicke Bridge where the real exchange took place in 1962. While missing the labyrinth of twists and turns of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, it's knowing that these are real people in real situations that make this historic drama so thrilling and riveting to watch. Film lovers will also get a kick out of the fact that the script was co-written by the Coen Brothers, and history lovers will enjoy seeing some of the details provided by the written words of those involved, as well as their surviving family members. It's an era that seems so long ago, yet the topics are so pertinent to what's happening in the world today. Beyond all of that, it's a story of a man standing up for what's right at a time when that was not the easy or popular way.","

"Bridge of Spies","lee_eisenberg","7 December 2016","People in the 21st century might not be that familiar with the U-2 incident (a US spy plane got shot down over the Soviet Union and the pilot got arrested). If Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" is a good introduction. Indeed, one of the most important scenes is when Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) explains that he is defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) because the Constitution says that even the people charged with the most heinous crimes deserve equal protection under the law; this scene is just as relevant during the so called War on Terrorism, which is now likely to go supernova under a Trump presidency.But there was another side to the U-2 incident. Eisenhower was planning a summit with the leaders of the UK, France and the USSR, in the hope of easing Cold War tensions. The U-2 spy plane got shot down right before the summit was to take place, and the summit got canceled. It looks as though the plane got sent over the USSR to deliberately sabotage the summit, as the US hardliners didn't want an easing of Cold War tensions. This makes clear why Ike warned about the military industrial complex.A previous reviewer complained that the movie didn't emphasize things that were representative of the era, like cars or music. I interpreted the absence of these things to mean that this story is a timeless one, especially the matter of civil liberties in wartime.I'd say that Rylance deserved his Oscar win.","

"Bridge of Spies","amesmonde","3 June 2016","The bar association asks insurance lawyer James B. Donovan to defend a suspected Russian spy arrested on American soil. When an American spy is captured Donovan becomes a negotiator for two of the world powers to agree the prisoners release.With the film based on real-life events writers Matt Charman, Joel and Ethan Coen turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB into a tense and often humorous cat-and-mouse game. Suffering with a cold, quick thinking breifcase touting Tom Hanks' law-abiding lead character Donovan is gripping as he is used as a go between by his own government with German and Russian officials. Hanks brings an everyday man vulnerability, akin to Michael Caines' Harry Palmer to the role. Steven Spielberg offers a finely crafted Cold War espionage thriller, wonderfully recreating the Cold War era thanks to clever special effects. The stakes are high, you witness the Berlin Wall being built, it's an appealing diplomatic film. There are tense moments littered throughout, notably when Donovan is tasked in defending a Russian spy in a court of law, the backlash from his community and the danger he puts his family carries an impact.Its a fine production. Bridge of Spies is interesting throughout and it surprisingly captures some old fashion Hollywood magic.","

"Bridge of Spies","estebangonzalez10","27 October 2015","""This man, my father's friend, he was beaten. Every time they hit him, he stood back up again. They hit him harder, still he got back to his feet. I think because of this they let him live.""Over the past few years Steven Spielberg has shied away from the big blockbuster productions and settled for historical dramas such as Lincoln, War Horse, and Munich. Now we can add Bridge of Spies to Spielberg's list of history lessons which counts on some outstanding and understated performances from an A list cast. This is the fourth collaboration between Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and although it doesn't rank amongst my favorite I still enjoyed the character he plays here. Hanks is James B. Donovan, an insurance attorney with a strong sense of justice who also happens to be a respectable family man. Hanks plays the character very subtly and in a way he reminded me of Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch because both characters seem to share a strong moral code and they put their sense of justice above what the community might think of them. Here Donovan is given the task to serve as a defense attorney for a KGB intelligence officer named Rudolf Abel (played masterfully by Mark Rylance) during the height of the Cold War. You can imagine how the public reacts when Donovan begins to take his role seriously and defends this spy. It takes a toll on his family as well, his wife is played here by Amy Ryan and his children by Jillian Lebling, Noah Schnapps, and Eve Hewson. They believe in him, but also seem to be going through a similar conflict. My complaint here is that Amy Ryan is sidelined and doesn't get to play an important role in the movie. There is also a parallel story going on as several US pilots are being recruited on a special mission to secretly fly U2 planes over the Soviet Union to gather intel. One of these pilots is Francis Powers (Austin Stowell) who on his first mission is shot down and captured by the soviets. The two plots come together when Donovan is asked by US government officials to try to negotiate a deal to interchange their prisoners. Spielberg delivers a historical piece with precise attention to detail giving us once again another important lesson about humanity's unsung heroes. Donovan represents the ideal character here with strong moral values that are often forgotten or overlooked in today's movie. I couldn't think of a better actor to play such a character than the great Tom Hanks. However the standout for me was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. It was a breath of fresh air to see a character like this portrayed in such a humane light. He is not the enemy here, he is a man who is doing his job and also seems to share a strong moral code. Rylance gives the film's best performance and I think he out shined everyone in this film. The great Alan Alda also gets to be on screen for a few minutes although he isn't playing against type or anything like that. Political thrillers are rarely in my interest, but I couldn't let this film pass me by considering Steven Spielberg is the director who has made more of my favorite films than any other. Include a screenplay co-written with the Coen brothers and I was sold. The pacing of the film at times did seem to drag the movie down, but Spielberg treats the material with respect. Kaminski's cinematography captures the era perfectly and Newman's score adds to the emotional moments. The 50's are perfectly captured through the art direction and Spielberg managed to transport us back to Berlin during the construction of the wall. Overall I enjoyed my history lesson once again from Steven Spielberg, but I felt that the film could've benefited from more thrills and a better pacing. It's still a must see in my book. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","

"Bridge of Spies","petra_ste","5 April 2016","This Cold War thriller confirms two things about director Steven Spielberg.First: he is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema. It's amazing how he makes every sequence visually interesting, fluid and well-paced, from dialogue scenes (which represent the bulk of Bridge of Spies) to action set-pieces (here just a brief plane crash). He gets strong performances from his actors, here Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, the latter in an Award-winning turn as a mild-mannered Soviet spy. The director's efficiency on set is legendary: Bridge of Spies looks great in spite of a slim (for Hollywood standards!) forty millions budget. Spielberg was just born to narrate stories...... and that's why his films, even the few I don't particularly like, as a general rule still have *something* worth recommending.Second: Spielberg's movies have diabetes. Sugar is sprinkled everywhere, peaking with sappy endings. Bridge of Spies would be greatly improved by radically altering or excising the last ten minutes... much like War of the Worlds, AI, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Minority Report. Looking back, it's surprising Spielberg delivered in Raiders of the Lost Ark one of the most memorably ironic epilogues ever.... and that's why I prefer Spielberg's more lighthearted films, like Jaws or Jurassic Park; in serious movies his fluffy endings feel more grating and inappropriate.Overall, Bridge of Spies is solid. The Coen brothers co-wrote the script, their touch shining through in several absurdist, humorous moments.7,5/10","

"Bridge of Spies","jadepietro","26 October 2015","(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: A riveting docudrama with Spielberg and Hanks at the top of their gameGRADE: A-Bridge of Spies is a true Cold War tale about the espionage business, its unethical surveillance methods, and the ongoing political war games orchestrated between powerful nations. The film does shamelessly manipulate the emotions of its audience and, at times, lets the nostalgia wash over its subject matter depicting more innocent times than in actuality, but, in the capable hands of Steven Spielberg, this is superb filmmaking and one of the year's best. ￼ The director's masterful handling of this complex story impresses in its concise storytelling and richly drawn characters. The screenplay by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers builds its narrative convincingly and clearly lays its background exposition through its compelling dialog that not only establishes the characters and their motives but moves the action at a steady pace.The year is 1957 when the United States and Russia were major enemies and spies worked undercover in search of oneupmanship. (Some things never change.) Back then, the world was splintering into different political factions, the military industrial complex was expanding, the threat of nuclear retaliation was a common practice, and the Berlin Wall became a reality. (A few do.)￼Into this quagmire is yet another political incident involving a convicted Russian spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and an imprisoned American, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a pilot caught behind enemy lines. One man, a lawyer named James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked to act as a go-between and secretly negotiate their exchange. The film chronicles these events with authenticity and high drama.The acting is excellent and the film is very well cast. Mr. Hanks has played the similarly upright decent common man role before but he continually impresses with his restraint and understatement of a man with a moral code that will not waiver. The actor never allows his character to overplay the righteousness and make Donovan more complicated by his subtle acting choices. Mr. Rylance has the more showier role as Abel and he brings a sly and layered portrait of a man who seems to enjoy being the pawn in this chess match. Other standouts include Alan Alda as one of Donavan's associates, Dakin Matthews as a very biased judge, Jon Curry and Michael Gaston as determined CIA agents, Will Rogers as as idealistic college student caught in the cloak-and-dagger web of intrigue, and Amy Ryan as Donovan's loving 50's wife, white pearl necklace included.￼Production values are top notch. Janusz Kaminski's lovely muted photography, wonderful art direction designed by Adam Stockhausen, Kasia Walicka-Malmone's nuanced period costumes, and a subtle and haunting music score by the talented Thomas Newman all work to enhance this film. But it is Mr. Spielberg's vision that resonates. His love of period Americana and the late fifties era create powerful vignettes (e.g.: spectators in a courtroom rise segueing into students reciting the Pledge of Allegiance leading to a school lecture on the effects of radiation poisoning to highly impressionable children, desperate people trying to escape over the Berlin Wall and, moments later, seeing typical children playing and climbing over wire fences, reporters scurrying over broken discarded flashbulbs from old fashioned cameras that litter a courthouse corridor, a frightening aerial escape as a plane spins out of control. Special kudos to Michael Kahn for his skillful editing as well.) Spielberg's willingness to establish period details of pop culture images defines the film brilliantly.￼Bridge of Spies is a triumph and one of Mr. Spielberg's finest cinematic projects to date.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com","

"Bridge of Spies","swilliky","19 October 2015","I prepared myself for the slow and steady spy-craft of Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies and got to watch another strong performance from Tom Hanks.I was not familiar with this piece of history but apparently this insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan, had quite an effect on U.S. foreign negotiations during the Cold War. I can't help thinking there were some other stories to tell and should do some research on why Spielberg chose this particular story to adapt into a motion picture. There was certainly historical significance to the events depicted and I alway like to be made to think and to learn. It looked beautiful, shots, scenery, costumes, but I did notice it was just a bunch of white guys for the most part and a few minor roles for woman. I have been reading Hollywood has a problem with that but it's not like this movie set out to change that and I guess they were just displaying the times. There were also some great supporting performances by Mark Rylance, as Russian spy Rudolf Abel, and Amy Ryan, who played Donovan's wife and was also the mother in the recent Goosebumps movie. Someone should give her a leading role. I liked her all the way back in The Wire. Scott Shepherd was also good as a CIA agent.This movie hinges on Hanks performance and I had no doubt he would deliver. He especially excels in the final climactic scenes. I liked this movie but it was also a bit slow and doesn't necessarily need to be seen in theaters. This is the fourth collaboration between Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg after Saving Private Ryan (one of the greatest war movies ever), The Terminal (forgettable), and Catch Me If You Can (another great movie).

"Bridge of Spies","ClaytonDavis","5 October 2015","One of the most prolific directors in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg, returns to the silver screen with his new period thriller ""Bridge of Spies"" starring two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks. It features competent and solid filmmaking from its director, writers, and crafts team however, the film doesn't quite ignite passion and excitement from its standard storytelling. What really manages to standout is the impeccable and sensational performance of Emmy Award nominee Mark Rylance, who steals and owns every scene he's present.The film tells the story of James Donovan (Hanks), an American lawyer that is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. It all begins with the discovery of a probable spy on our own soil Rudolf Abel (Rylance), who tests Donovan's profession and safety net.Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg brings many of his signature techniques to the spy tale. Tugging at the emotional heartstrings is an Olympic event at this juncture in his career, although not exactly hitting the mark the way it was intended. He frames his scenes with the same familiar authority that we've grown to love about Spielberg, and it definitely exceeds some of his lesser works like ""War Horse"" and ""The Terminal."" What the film truly lacks is a daring approach to its source material. Unfamiliar with the story and real life individuals, Spielberg, and the writers, Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman, don't enter the grit and horror of two countries at a feud, literally on the brink of a real devastating war.Tom Hanks brings his natural charisma and wit that we've loved about him for decades. His James Donovan is caring, engaging, and reminiscent of Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" His devotion to his family and the human condition is truly admirable, all clear and on display thanks to Hanks. As Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance is just a joy to behold, filling in the gaps of the film's shortcomings with charm and seasoned acting ability. It's a brilliant turn by a brilliant actor. It's one of the year's best supporting turns and a contender for the Oscar statue.As James' wife Mary, Amy Ryan is relegated to just a few scenes but great nonetheless. Also brief are the works of Billy Magnussen and Alan Alda, who have good, solid one scenes to chew on.Technically the film does present qualms. Janusz Kaminski's camera work is distracting in parts, shining bright lights through windows, and keeping a one note camera style all throughout its 135 minute run time. Thomas Newman's score isn't put to its best use, as it swells in inopportune moments, even managing to overwhelm a key and fantastic scene by Rylance. Michael Kahn cuts the film to a bloated expansive run time but manages to keep you involved enough to make it through. The film really shines in its Production Design by Adam Stockhausen and its Costume work by Kasia Walicka-Maimone.""Bridge of Spies"" may find lovers in mass audiences. What it does well is ignite a curiosity and power to look at the history of its subject. Spielberg succeeds at introducing the world to James Donovan and what else he contributed to society, along with the supporting players at hand. We do wish that a better, more dynamic treatment had hit the screens. From an awards standpoint, it's going to appeal to a great deal. Perhaps a second viewing will open up more possibilities.","

"Bridge of Spies","LW-08854","23 December 2023","The film is very dialogue heavy, with great production design, well lit, expertly directed and filmed, a little humour mixed into the script, plus a brilliant performance by Mark Rylance. Both the script and the style of the film felt very old Hollywood to me, there's a strong focus on characters and carefully written dialogue rather than showy melodrama and to make clear that Mark Rylance is not playing the bad guy in the film his position is contrasted with an American captured by the USSR on similar spy charges. The characterization of Rylance's character also leads the audience towards sympathy with him, his mild manner and honest persona win not just his lawyer over but the wider audience.In terms of suitability for children I'd say it's fine, though they might find it a bit slow in parts, There's little violence and when it does happen it's nothing up close or graphic, though the mood is tense throughout. Some of the direction is slightly clunky and on the nose, but overall I think there's much to enjoy. The CGI is not great.","

"Bridge of Spies","writers_reign","28 November 2015","This could almost be subtitled To Kill A Nightingale for what we have is no less than Tom Hanks as Atticus Finch, the ultra respectable lawyer and seemingly the only one who can be approached to defend a no-hoper in the shape of Mark Rylance, honorary Black man and, as a Russian spy in the in the heart of the Cold War as persona non grata in New York as Tom Robinson in 1930s Alabama. In a further touch of irony Gregory Peck, the personification of Atticus Finch, would have arguably been first choice to play Donovan had he still been available but Tom Hanks who, to some extent, plays Gregory Peck good-guy roles for a living, makes a creditable pinch- hitter. Whereas Atticus Finch was a fictional recreation of Harper Lee's lawyer father Donovan was a real person as was Francis Gary Powers, the pilot shot down in Russian air space who declined to kill himself rather than be captured. As comedian Mort Sahl said at the time, there have been two traitors in US history, the first was Nathan Hale who said 'I regret I have but one life to give for my country', the second was Francis Gary Powers, who said, 'this shatters all my plans'. Donovan is, of course, unable to secure a not guilty verdict for his client but he does prevail upon the court to spare him execution on the grounds that he may prove useful as a pawn in some future negotiation and when Powers is captured he is able to broker an exchange. Both Hanks and Mark Rylance turn in fine performances and for a cerebral rather than action-filled thriller the film is a success.","

"Bridge of Spies","evanston_dad","15 April 2016","I thought that the Coen brothers as co-screenwriters of ""Bridge of Spies"" meant that we might get some restraint and intelligence to balance the maudlin platitudes that almost certainly come attached with a Steven Spielberg film. But I was wrong. Spielberg takes a chilly Cold War setting and then proceeds to pump sentimentality into it until by the end it's as sunny and warm as a Folgers coffee commercial.Tom Hanks, as usual, does his best to calm Spielberg down, and plays the main character as an every man Joe trying to do the right thing despite Spielberg's attempts to cram his heroics down our throats. But by the film's end, he's as overwhelmed by the rest of us by Spielberg's schmaltz, served with healthy doses of the requisite pounding Spielbergian score, this one supplied not by John Williams but rather by Thomas Newman.Mark Rylance won an Oscar for playing a Russian spy who barely speaks, and I suppose I appreciated his ability to convey emotions without histrionics, something Spielberg certainly isn't capable of. But I can't say I really see that he did anything special enough to warrant an Academy Award.The Coens were nominated for their script, which they co-wrote with Matt Charman, and the film also copped nominations for Best Picture, Production Design, Original Score, and Sound Mixing.Grade: B-","

"Bridge of Spies","RforFilm","27 October 2015","As a child who grew up during the late nineties through the mid 2000's, I was part of the first generation to be raised in an era where there wasn't a second great power on Earth. Being born in 1987, I was living within the Cold War for only a few years, during the last moments of an interesting generation for America; a generation that once thought that a third World War with the Soviets was possible and that any day could be the last before the bomb was dropped. It was the last of an era were today's movie perfectly says was a war of information.Given how many WWII movies are out there, I'm surprised that nostalgia and our obsession with history has not produced more movies about the Cold War. Though there are plenty before the Soviet Union was dissolved (Including Dr. Strangelove, Rocky IV and my favorite of the bunch, WarGames), you'd think that more stories about the era would have opened up allowing for plenty of entertaining options. Steven Spielberg is a director that has tackled WWII plenty of times (1941, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), so Bridge of Spies should seem like a literal and figurative bridge to connect that transition. In 1957 Brooklyn, a middle-aged painter Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) is seen picking up a secret message and reads it before FBI agents burst into his apartment. He's arrested and prosecuted as a Soviet spy, sparking a media and public demand for his death. As per rule by the court, Rudolf is given a lawyer for his defense, which turns out to be James B. Donovan (played by Tom Hanks). The interesting thing is that James is an insurance lawyer with little experience in criminal law, but takes the case anyway to show that he's loyal to his profession.James receive hate mail and accusations from people, his own children and even get's approached by the CIA, but stands on his ground that he's simply doing his job, helping the soviet spy. Though Rudolf is found guilty, James convinces the judge the give a jail sentence rather then death in case of needed collateral. That moment comes soon enough when CIA agent Francis Gary Powers is shot down and jailed by the Soviets. Both governments agree to an exchange, but not only does James actually have to go to East Germany to negotiate the deal, but when another American is jailed, he tries to get a two for one prisoner.Steven Spielberg has a track record that's easy to rely to when defending his movies, yet I wasn't sure how I'd respond to the political-legal thriller that Bridge of Spies is. I'm proud to say that it s engaging in a most unexpected way. While the subject doesn't seem too remarkable, once you get to know both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance's (who I hope gets an awards nomination for his portrayal) character, you get a good idea of what both sides are hoping to achieve, both as a stance on what it means to be loyal to your country and doing what's right.Aside from being a strong character piece, Bridge of Spies has a different look then you might expect from the more whimsical Spielberg. This fits right along his darker material as most of the movie is shown is greyer tones and surprisingly gets greyer once the story shifts to East Germany. With that said, the recreation of a Cold War Berlin looks great, especially when you see Tom Hanks riding the train to the other side where the wall shows what the difference is in one moment (which I won't give away).I'll give this ten cold war posters out of ten. Bridge of Spies is guaranteed one of my favorite movies of 2015 and deserves at least one watch from not just cold war fanatics or even history fanatics, but from the mainstream crowd. Bridge of Spies will get least start one conversation going once the end credits roll.","

"Bridge of Spies","neil-476","27 November 2015","It is 1957, and commercial lawyer James Donovan is required to defend spy Rudolf Abel, which he does (unsuccessfully). When US spy pilot Gary Powers is shot down by the Russians, Donovan is called upon to negotiate an exchange, into which he factors US student Frederic Pryor in a 2-for-1 exchange. But Powers is held by the Russians and Pror is held by the East Germans, and they don't have the same agendas.Steven Spielberg picks up the hidden parts of a story which had disappeared under the headline value of Gary Powers Shot Down, and it turns out to be quite a small story, but displayed on a big canvas (the painting metaphor is apt, as Abel's painting forms part of the film's narrative). The film conjures up its era very well – the comfort of 1950s USA vs the grim drabness of Berlin, the USA paranoia over the red menace, the communist paranoia over everything. And, among the efficient and effective telling of the story (aided by a script touch-up from the Coen brothers), there are the usual Spielbergian directorial flourishes, primarily some wonderful moving camera shots. This is not an attractive film – post-war Berlin was not an attractive city – but it is never less than rewarding to watch.Tom Hanks does a sterling job as the deceptively mild but steely Donovan, and Mark Rylance's Abel is similar to his Thomas Cromwell: a watcher and a listener, with quiet depths.This is not a film full of bluster and bombast, but it is an impressive and gripping movie.","

"Bridge of Spies","StevePulaski","19 October 2015","Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" opens in a quiet, almost meditative manner, giving us a sense of the hustle in 1957 Brooklyn during the brutal Cold War. Spielberg focuses on movements of characters and slow, melodic buildup that results in a shockingly peaceful opening, giving what we can foresee will occur. We then cut to a man named Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), who retrieves a secret message in public before he returns to his apartment to be apprehended by FBI agents believing he is a Soviet spy.Subsequently, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), a lawyer who specializes in insurance settlements, is requested to take the case and serve as Abel's defense. The difficultly in the forthcoming legal battle is to ensure that Abel gets a fair trial, despite relations with Russian boiling like an unattended pot on a hot stove. Also during this time is the famous U-2 incident, where an American spy plane was shot down by Soviets and resulted in the death of Pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). As a result, Donovan must now go to the USSR in order to try and sanction an exchange for Abel's safe return to his homeland for Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), an economics professor who was arrested under suspicion of being a spy during the construction of the Berlin Wall.The first half of ""Bridge of Spies"" is so quiet and low-key that it's almost a marvel of some sort. Spielberg further proves himself to be a delicate artist, with a gentle, liberal hand for long takes and intimate settings that build relationships with characters through tight, formal structures. Working with his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, Spielberg gives this film a classic-film look, almost echoing the dark and brooding sentiments of Hanks' overlooked ""Road to Perdition."" This film feels like a Cold War-era film about a forgotten piece of the era, thanks to its emphasis on classic set decoration and Spielberg's directorial artistry.The second half of ""Bridge of Spies,"" however, opts for an approach more grounded in what you'd expect from this kind of a film: talky setups, moral conveniences, and a more linear A-to-B plot structure instead of the fascinating ambiguity and meditative qualities a Spielberg film like ""Lincoln"" or ""Munich"" maintained throughout their entire runtimes. During this latter half of the film - which admittedly doesn't cripple it - even with the film's scope extended to a more international level, we still zero in on the fine performance by Tom Hanks, who further proves that pairing him with Spielberg can almost do no wrong.Hanks plays a character conflicted because of oppressive times to the point where some may find it difficult to see ""the big deal"" behind defending a Soviet spy on American soil. The moral ideas about following through with due process and a fair trial, while pretty standard and predictable for anyone who paid attention in law class, is still nonetheless a fascinating depiction of a film that is erected on difficult, weighty decisions by characters that always come with an accompanied ""but..."" whenever they are audibly proposed. Probably the most underrated component of the film, however, is the relationship Hanks' Donovan has with Rylance's Abel. The two occupy a sort of respectful, father/son relationship with one another that makes their banter that much more believable, in addition to softly humorous in some respect. The film would've benefited from more of these simple scenes between two men caught in very difficult positions where a rulebook of any kind eludes them.The film was co-written by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, and in some ways, the more somber style of filmmaking makes this feel more like a Coen spectacle than a Spielberg film. However, it's the poetry communicated through Spielberg's directing that makes the film feel so fluid, in addition to the strong narrative that is given time to build over the course of nearly two and a half hours. All of these elements blended with some great, subtle period cinematography and a strong Hanks performance and you have a fascinating adult drama that, while not as layered as it could be, is an enriching experience.","

Tom Hanks gave an incredible performance as the non-fictional character, James B. Donovan. I really enjoyed this film because of that aspect; that it really happened. It was such an eye opening film to a true story I never really knew about it. Hanks was an extremely powerful and convincing lawyer and it was very interesting to see how his mind worked when it came to dealing with the character Rudolf Abel, played by Mark Rylance. Rylance also delivered a wonderful performance. Overall, this film was an interesting insight to events during the Cold War and a story that definitely needed to be told.","

"Bridge of Spies","Robert_duder","9 December 2015","Bridge of Spies had two things going for it that I thought for sure would make it a hit in my books. You have Tom Hanks and you have Steven Spielberg. How can you go wrong? Probably one of the greatest actors known to us and one of the greatest directors. Bridge of Spies is a fascinating story, well acted, definitely saved from oblivion by the intense talent of the two aforementioned men. However, the pacing of the film is definitively off. It feels slow and it is slow. It is almost cumbersome to try and pay attention. There just feels like there is something missing that makes it more captivating and I think professional critics will agree with me and Bridge of Spies won't make a splash at all. Now all that said, there is no doubt you can see Spielberg's masterful eye and vision in many shots. The film is, at times, a cinematographic masterpiece. Visually amazing scenes of Berlin during the wall being put up and the horrifyingly powerful scene of Hanks watching people desperately trying to get over the wall. The bleak coldness of Berlin at the time (although apparently the wrong time of year for the real story - it worked well for dramatization purposes.) Tom Hanks...the man, the legend...a living icon of Hollywood. He produces and writes and acts and gets awards and he has had an incredible career. He is just charismatic on screen and he becomes every character he portrays and this performance is no exception. His portrayal is passionate and the character well established. Hanks does what he does best. Mark Rylance is getting a lot of buzz for his performance as Russian spy Rudolf Abel and certainly he does a good job in a sort of understated and subtle way. His role isn't very big but it is effective and he and Hanks are great together. It's a very fascinating relationship. The supporting cast are all good but the film definitely focuses heavily on Hanks' character so they get small roles. Amy Ryan, Austin Stowell, Dakin Matthews, Sebastian Koch and Burghart Klaußner are a few of the better supporting performances in the film.Saying anything about Steven Spielberg's direction is literally pointless. The man is a master and a visionary and as I mentioned you can definitely his expert mastery in the film. The only issue perhaps is that someone who is editing or producing his films might be reluctant to be honest about potential issues. Bridge of Spies goes on too long and stumbles in several respects and even misses some key things that could have made the story more interesting. Still, it has it's appeal but considering Hanks and Spielberg's involvement at the head it is forgettable in its genre and that's simply unfortunate. I sort of had high expectations for good reason it only delivered on a very slight level. Worth watching once but don't expect a Saving Private Ryan or a Schindler's List but poor man's version of either of those. 7/10","

"Bridge of Spies","Mike_Devine","29 July 2021","As with most Steven Spielberg films, 'Bridge of Spies' was a shoe-in for a best picture nomination at the 2016 Academy Awards. Wartime setting? Check. International relations-infused drama based on true events? Check. Tom Hanks? Of course - check.Despite the formulaic nature of 'Spies,' the film is unsurprisingly as well done as most things Spielberg touches. He has a way with turning something that could be very straightforward on paper into a story that tugs at the heartstrings while making several twists and turns. Here, we see a bond develop between Hanks's virtuous Brooklyn lawyer and an alleged Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in a tangled web of deceit, wargames and trickery that defined this era. There's a cold and dark undertone to the film, which matches the harsh elements on screen, but Hanks's James Donovan is a lighthouse in his crusade for justice.But it's not just the acting that stands out here. The execution of 'Spies' is something to take note of, from the use of visual call-backs throughout the film like the images of people jumping the Berlin wall and backyard fences to the refrain of Rylance's question ""Would it help?"" in response to multiple statements Hanks makes, these serve as Spielberg's fingerprints on his product.'Bridge of Spies' is not the most memorable film from this genre. Instead, it's an understated story of personal achievement that is happy to exist as a snapshot of a moment in time from a contentious period in our history.","

"Bridge of Spies","jdring2007","9 June 2021","I'll preface this review by saying this is NOT my typical movie. But, I've been on a Spielberg binge and I do like educating myself. However it seemed that anything the Coen Brothers write gets praised; I'm ambivalent about this. Here, the script often felt forced and theatrical, despite the solemn subject matter. The movie, at its best, is powerful, but only subtly. Long and slow, with very little tension, it felt more like a documentary than a ""suspense drama,"" and absolutely not a ""thriller."" The Bay of Pigs negotiations mentioned at the end of the movie would have seemed like a much better and more inspiring movie. Nonetheless, performances were on par with the actors casted, although nothing above and beyond.","

"Bridge of Spies","bankofmarquis","24 October 2015","Sometimes, you go to the Cineplex to ""catch a flick"". Sometimes, you go to ""watch a movie"". And sometimes, if you're lucky, you are able to ""view a film"".BRIDGE OF SPIES is a film in every sense of the word.Directed by the great Steven Spielberg, BRIDGE OF SPIES tells the story of the Cold War prisoner exchange in the early 1960's that was brokered by the character portrayed by Tom Hanks . Taking his time telling this story in a script that was written by Matt Charman and punched up the the Coen brothers, Spielberg and Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski create a gray, grainy and, yes, cold world that accurately depicts the feelings of the time.Not only is Spielberg at the top of his game but so is Hanks in the lead role. He imbues lawyer James Donovan with strength courage and decency while also showing the fear of the unknown that permeates the movie and the Cold War times of the early '60's. It is Hanks best performance in quite some time and further cements him as one of the best actors of our generation.Spielberg, Hanks, Kaminski, Coen are all ""veteran"" movie names that show, yet again, that they know what they are doing and create a film/world that is interesting to look at and satisfying to experience. But it is relative film newcomer Mark Rylance, as Russian spy Rudolf Abel who steals the show. This veteran theater actor has a minimalist expressive face that shows more emotion in a raised eyebrow than most actors show in the entire performances. It is a memorable performance and one that I expect to see called out come Academy Awards time.If you are looking for an ""action"" spy movie - wait for the James Bond film that is coming out in a few weeks. If you are looking for a smart, atmospheric, well acted FILM that accurately depicts the mood, feeling and atmosphere of the Cold War, view BRIDGE OF SPIES.It's terrific.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)","

But his Kaminsky knows at least to compose with lights and for some really brief moments, I thought I was back into the X-files! Next, this movie is clearly divided into 2 parts: the one in US about the trial of the soviet spy and the other in Berlin about the exchange. The 1st one is the best as in Munich, Amistad and Lincoln, Spielberg defends justice for all and punches the security pretext! However, the 2nd part is just awful, filled with candid sugar (Hanks is also responsible) and totally unbelievable! In addition, the movie is much too long because of a lot of useless scenes (U2 mission, the detention, ). At the end, Spielberg is really far of his best: he proves one more time that he is very fragile on political movies but at least, he did them and he has found a great old actor with the soviet spy.","

In the film, we see James Donovan, an insurance lawyer roped into representing a Soviet spy, who is later promoted as a negotiator for the exchange of American POWs held captive by the Commies.As a film that relies heavily on directing, dialogue & acting, BoS delivers. Spielberg showcases masterful camerawork, adding thrill & emotions through well timed close ups and character placement in long takes. This compliments very well with the crackling script stamped by the Coen brothers. As for our stars, Tom Hanks gives another Oscar worthy performance as his dramatization of intense and colorful moments was captivating. Thanks to his satisfying performance, I was blindsided with how un-dull the film was specially for a ""talking"" film. Mark Rylance was just as impressive! His delivery of the restrained and unnerved Soviet mole takes an unsympathetic character & turns it into one of the years 's memorable movie creations.Overall, I would give this film an 8/10 and further props for its old school Hollywood traits in filmmaking.","

"Bridge of Spies","kmonk-67893","10 December 2015","How Steven Spielberg went from the king of summer thrills to the most boring director in Hollywood is a problem that's perplexed me since I pried my eyes open through Lincoln.We all know the man can make a great movie. Most of us grew up on a diet of E.T., Jaws and Indiana Jones: spectacular event films with all the entertainment oomph of a theme park roller coaster.Then, Spielberg hit middle age and wanted to make important films for grown-ups. He made Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Munich, but he also made Minority Report, A.I and War of the Worlds – pretty decent action films with big star power.It looked like Spielberg had come of age with a sharpened skill set and a slightly deeper world view, but the more high-brow Spielberg gets, the duller his movies become...Inspired by real life events, and apparently a footnote in a JFK biography, Bridge of Spies tells the story of an insurance attorney named James Donovan. A mild-mannered family man plucked from a Norman Rockwell painting, Donovan is as American as the flag itself – and it's a trait he waves at every opportunity, from gratuitous speeches about the American Constitution to his acceptance of a case he is destined to lose.In the opening act, we watch an older man (Mark Rylance) take his easel on the subway, sit in the park and paint, and very carefully remove a fake nickel from the underside of a park bench. The nickel is hollow, and written on a tiny piece of paper within, is a series of codes.The man's name is Rudolf Abel, and he's arrested for treason and espionage just a few moments later. Given the year is 1957, Abel's fate looks bleak. The Rosenbergs were executed just four years earlier after being convicted of similar charges, and Abel refuses to cooperate with the CIA, making him delectably disposable.These days, he'd probably just disappear, but back then, America still believed its own propaganda and the notion of due process. It must appear as if Abel is getting a fair and just trial, which is where James Donovan comes in... It feels a little like a greatest hits album, but the scenes with Mark Rylance have real pop. The two men have an interesting dynamic as ideological warriors who landed on different sides of the battlefield, and it's the only part of the film that has any real traction because everyone else is locked in a freezer of Cold War archetype.Spielberg capitalizes on the common ground, offering up timely and inspirational rhetoric concerning the importance of due process, Constitutional rights and freedoms, and the American way, but like Lincoln, the big speeches have all the subtlety of a Broadway musical...Abridged from Ex.Press.com","

"Bridge of Spies","howard.schumann","29 November 2015","The height of the Cold War, the late 1950s, was a time of anti-Communist hysteria fueled by Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist crusade and only four years after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted and executed for providing atomic secrets to the Russians. While it may seem anachronistic to make a film about the Cold War, the points made in Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies are just as relevant today. Like Spielberg's Lincoln, it is a film about values, about standing up for what you know to be right instead of succumbing to your fears, not an examination of the rights and wrongs of international intrigue or the merits or demerits of the Cold War. Co-written by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman, insurance lawyer James Donovan, (Tom Hanks), is called upon by his boss (Alan Alda) to defend Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a defense that would thwart a public opinion calling for his summary execution. In attempting to mount a defense, Donovan discovers that the government only wants him to go through the motions of due process, not to actually mount a strong case for his acquittal. Not even Donovan's family wants him to defend Abel, especially after they receive death threats and rocks are thrown through the windows. In the film's opening sequence, Abel is seen painting a self-portrait in a room filled with receivers and transmitters when he is interrupted by a phone call. Leaving his building, he is pursued by federal agents in a frantic chase through streets and subways tracked by cinematographer Janusz Kaminsky. When captured in his home by the feds, the taciturn Abel in a breakout performance by Shakespearean actor Rylance maintains his calm and denies that he is a spy. All he can say is to ask that the agent to please fetch his teeth from the bathroom. Un-Communist spy-like, Abel is also given to dry humor. When asked why he is so calm in the face of possible execution, he replies, ""Would it help?"" a response that is humorous and appropriate but repeated once too often in the film to maintain its edge. Though aware of the strong evidence of his client's guilt, Donovan establishes a good relationship with Abel whom he calls a man of integrity who is only serving his country. The first part of the film depicts the court proceedings, the sentencing, and Donovan's appeal to the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds, an appeal that he lost on a 5-4 decision. The bulk of the film, however, takes place in Berlin where it turns into an international spy thriller, and a good one at that. The film shows the CIA's secret U2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) flying at 70,000 feet en route to Russia to photograph military installations when it is shot down over Russian air space. When Powers disobeys instructions from his superiors to go down with the plane and is captured by the Russians where he is imprisoned and tortured, the event torpedoes the summit meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, dashing the world's hopes for peace. Spielberg does not hold back from showing the techniques that Powers is forced to undergo, perhaps a reference to the CIA's use of water-boarding during the Iraq War. Called upon to negotiate a prisoner exchange between the Soviets and the East Germans of Powers and captured American student Frederic L. Pryor (Will Rogers) for Abel, Donovan is mugged by East German punks and stripped of his overcoat in the freezing snow, suggesting the addition of ""The Spy Who Got a Cold"" to the film's title. Anyway, coat or no coat, Donovan must maintain the ruse that he is an independent party, not an official government representative and the back and forth intrigue and chess match of opposing wills ratchets up the tension until its dramatic conclusion. Bridge of Spies strives for and achieves a refreshing balance, not gratingly pro-American or excessively anti-Soviet but a film that demonstrates the sordid nature of espionage on both sides. I could complain about the unnecessary role played by Amy Ryan as Donovan's devoted wife, the ending that goes on past the film's logical dramatic stopping point, or the overwrought score by Thomas Newman, but would it help? The film is best when it makes clear what American values are supposed to be about. Donovan's argument to the Supreme Court expresses this well. ""Abel is an alien charged with the capital offense of Soviet espionage,"" he said. ""It may seem anomalous that our Constitutional guarantees protect such a man.  Yet our principles are engraved in the history and the law of the land. If the free world is not faithful to its own moral code, there remains no society for which others may hunger."" Amen, brother!","

"Bridge of Spies","blanbrn","17 October 2015","""Bridge of Spies"" is a thriller starring Tom Hanks that was set during the Cold War times which involved a rescue mission of a Soviet spy. For any history buff or film fan of Tom Hanks this is one to see. Hanks is James B. Donovan a New York insurance lawyer who all of sudden one day gets selected by the CIA to go on a rescue mission of a spy. All of this is during the height of the Cold War. And thru it all a lot of secrets of government and under the table stuff is learned. All which involves negotiations of getting the spies released on both sides which includes America and Soviet Union spies. Overall this film is a test of defense and make a deal to fight for what is right proving that is the right way to get justice and freedom.","

Not so easy to do walking around a recently-bricked up city of East Berlin. STASI (East-German nasty secret police) and the KGB were ruthless & unpredictable.Hanks portrays a firm, but fair man in an under-stated but convincing manner. Other actors are at top of their game, as well. Since most 'kids' under 30 are scant in their knowledge of the COLD WAR, I almost think the film should be 'must-view' in High School history classes!Excellent 10/10.","

"Bridge of Spies","paul-allaer","17 October 2015","""Bridge of Spies"" (2015 release; 141 min.) brings the story of how insurance lawyer Jim Donovan became involved in negotiating a prisoner exchange in Berlin between the US and the USSR. As the movie opens, we are told that it is ""1957, the height of the cold war"". We then follow someone in Brooklyn, who after a long chase sequence gets arrested for spying for the Russians. In order to make it look like the spy is getting due process and a ""fair shake"", the US government appoints a lawyer to represent him. Turns out to be NY insurance lawyer (and ex-Nurnberg assistant prosecutor) Jim Donovan. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest in series of historical ""inspired by true events"" movies from director Steven Spielberg, this time directing from a script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen (yes, THE Coen brothers). I had seen the trailer a number of times, and was expecting a riveting movie in line with earlier historical movies from Spielberg such as Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Munich. Alas, it was not to be. The movie lacks any tension whatsoever, and has the feeling of having been done strictly ""by the numbers"". The best scenes are when we get to Berlin, in the frantic days as the wall was being completed and people were desperate to get out of East Berlin. And the of course the climax of the movie, filmed on the real bridge of spies (the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, near Potsdam--I had the good fortune of visiting this site a few years ago, it gave me the chills walking on it). There are several noteworthy acting performances: Tom Hanks (in his 4th cooperation with Spielberg) as Jim Donovan, and Mark Rylance as the spy Rudolf Abel (great line: Donovan: ""you're not worried?"", to which Abel responds: ""would it help?"", ha!). As always with Spielberg, the production is terrific and authentic in to the smallest of details. Last but certainly not least: the orchestral score is, shockingly, NOT by John Williams, which I believe marks the first time in 40 years in a Steven Spielberg (the score is from Thomas Newman, who does a fine job). Bottom lime: I found ""Bridge of Spies"" strangely subdued and to me it feels like Spielberg played it safe in this one.""Bridge of Spies"" opened nationwide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, but frankly I had expected a lot more people, given this is the movie's opening weekend. I have seen most of Spielberg's movies and as a long-time fan, must admit this to me feels like one of the weaker movies he's done in a long time. Is it bad? Of course not, but neither is it great. Nevertheless, this is of course a personal and subjective view, and I would encourage you to check out ""Bridge of Spies"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.","

"Bridge of Spies","jb_campo","15 May 2016","Bridge of Spies states that it is based on true events. It depicts the story of a Mr Abel (Mark Rylance), captured and accused of being a spy during he 1950's at the heart of the cold war between the US and Russia. Tom Hanks plays the Lawyer Jack Donovan who is offered the task of defending Mr Abel.Hanks does more than that, delivering a heartwarming portrayal of a good man who just wants to do good. After defending Abel and fighting for his survival, the US continues it's spying actions over Russia. Hanks is eventually asked to take a role that will challenge his nerves, his family, and his belief in all he believes in. Will he succeed in this role, or will he suffer the same horrible fate as so many East Germans?I really liked Bridge of Spies. The direction by Spielberg was excellent. The costume and scenery were great - really authentic. Hanks was terrific, and Rylance was good, though I think Rocky in Creed should have won the Academy Award. Through to the end, you wonder how this thriller will turn out. Watch Bridge of Spies to learn for yourself. It's a good, taut, few hours - and worth your while. Enjoy.","

Or most of them anyway.'Bridge of Spies' is a very long film - a whole two hours and twenty minutes - and much of the film is just conversation. Mostly political. Or espionage. This didn't really interest me. Something of interest - a bit of action maybe, or intrigue - only happened every now and again; few and far between.There's no denying this is a well made film. The performances are good, the directing is good, the cinematography is good, but ultimately this just isn't my kind of film. And to sit there for more than two hours watching 'not my kind of film', is not my idea of being entertained. Sorry.","

"Bridge of Spies","jaimegonzales210","12 January 2016","I guess the point of the movie was to demonstrate that Americans are over-reactive, unfair and hateful. From childhood, apparently, Americans learn to be bad people who grow up to be worse people. Any enemies we have must be good people. Never mind that there were Russian spies in America, they are portrayed as the ""good guys"" here. Americans were bad for a.) catching Russian spies and b.) engaging in the same espionage Russia was engaging in.A common theme among Hollywood stories seems to be that everyone but Americans are the good guys, yet Hollywood still has not relocated to the Palestine territories. Curious. It seems somewhat ironic to me that they benefit from capitalism while making movies about how actually evil capitalists are, then give themselves awards for half a year. Nobody I know makes $42 million for 24 days of filming, but somehow the person that does is more virtuous than my neighbor, who retired from law enforcement. He thinks America is a great place to live.","

"Bridge of Spies","cdjh-81125","14 October 2016","When I first saw Bridge of Spies in theatres it was purely because it was a Spielberg film yet I was still intrigued to see it I love Tom Hanks he's one of my all time favourite actors and thought it isn't Spielbergs best it's far from his worst and Bridge of Spies is a fantastic film with two Fantastic lead performances from both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. Like more of Spielbergs more recent films this is more of a dialogue driven drama and it's not discredit to him his films all have amazing dialogue and this is no different it makes for a compelling film that any Spielberg fan should watch. Tom Hanks in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg is fantastic in this film he's impossible not to get behind he just knows how to portray the every man quality of his character that just wants to do the right thing and that's what makes James Donovan such a great protagonist for this film he just wants to do the right thing despite all the hatred it brings him. But ultimately movie new comer Mark Ryalnce stole this movie and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for it he has amazing chemistry with Hanks. Ryalnce just brings a likability and vulnerability to him and his ""Standing Man"" scene will go down as one of the great movie scenes in a Spielberg movie. The courtroom scenes in this movie really gave you a sense of how people were during this time and gives you a chance to see what Donovan and Abel were facing for what they were trying to do. The flaws from this film though come from its second half the plot to free Powers just wasn't neither as compelling as the plot to free Abel and I would have personally would have portrayed his character more like James Ryan from another Spielberg film ""Saving Private Ryan"" it just would have made us more excited to finally see him and would have made for a more compelling story arc.But in the end I like Bridge of Spies much more than I ever thought I would it has fantastic dialogue, characters and performances making for one of the finest films of 2015. 88%-A-","

"Bridge of Spies","imdb-45","29 November 2015","With all the power names in this film it has all the potential to be one of the greatest. And sadly, this watchable and reasonably entertaining film falls incredibly flat on many accounts if you're someone who uses your brain. When a film relies upon a character study and doesn't have lots of action, there needs to be a proper foundation to justify why characters act the way they do - and that clearly wasn't the case here. And the film's attempt to be clever outsmarts itself.In summary, Hanks plays an insurance defense lawyer. He's recruited to be the face of a defense for an alleged Russian spy. The full details of the spy are unfortunately just left for the viewers imagination. There is a complete lack of developing the character other than ""a dispassionate old guy who likes to paint and look like a nice old man"" that Tom Hanks finds his heart bleeding after a meeting. There seems no question that the man is guilty. But Tom Hanks decides to go all the way to defend this man and beyond, in spite of being demonized in public as the defender of a traitor. Things get complicated when a US pilot is captured in Russia and an innocent American student as well in Germany.The performances are excellent. There is some witty dialogue and some character study, unquestionably the unrivaled abilities of the Coen brothers. I found the first 1/3 of the film to be the most engaging, by far.But as much as I admire their work, this film has Spielberg shmaltz draped all over it. And this ultimately is what makes this film (a) totally predictable; and (b) overly dramatic to the point of groaning multiple times. I found myself drawn completely outside of the movie when it was clear that these actors were just caricatures and very shallow, cardboard cutouts. The film was cardboard, mostly telling a noble series of events without knowing very much at all about all of the players. There is precious little to understand the true motives of any of the characters. And then there will be repeated one-liners for laughs (I thought the characters would wink at the screen) and moments where you could practically hear the director call for the camera to pan out and admire the actor, transfixed in his expression which makes a bold, iconic statement. (Yeah, I'm guessing it all went down just like that, a dramatic artistic moment.) It's an entertaining film but make no mistake before you decided to go -- this has Hollywood draped all over what you would not expect from a Coen Brothers script. If you can shut down your brain and cheer for American patriotism, you'll very much enjoy the film. But if you're a thinking person who picks up on subtle cues, you may find this a very contrived and predictable work.","

"Bridge of Spies","rogerdarlington","30 November 2015","A thriller co-authored by Joel and Ethan Coen, directed by Steven Spielberg and, starring Tom Hanks promises much - and fortunately ""Bridge Of Spies"" delivers. For all this super-talent, what gives the movie such power is the compelling story which is largely inspired by true events. At the height of the Cold War in 1962, an insurance lawyer called James Donovan (Hanks) - without any specific status or authority and suffering from a head cold during the key negotiations - managed to facilitate a spy swap. In return for downed U2 pilot Gary Powers, (and an unfortunate American student detained in East Berlin), the Americans agreed to hand over convicted Soviet KGB spy Rudolf Abel, the physical exchange of the actual spies taking place on Glienicke Bridge (hence the title of the movie echoing that other bridge in Venice).This is a great role for Hanks who plays the kind of decent American that is rare in the movies these days, an amicable lawyer who is willing to offer Abel a legal defence and gives a CIA operative a mini-lecture on the need to honour ""the rule book"" that is the US Constitution. In effect, Donovan is the bridge between Abel and Powers and the film cleverly tells the spies'stories in parallel - two dedicated state servants who become lonely prisoners whose only physical connection is a few seconds passing one another on a snowy bridge without a word exchanged between them. Abel is played by the outstanding British actor Mark Rylance who, as he did in his portrayal of Thomas Cromwell on BBC television, ushers a laconic, wry and understated persona (although his accent rather wanders).It is a tribute to the sharp (and sometimes amusing) script - co-authored by British dramatist Matt Charmian - that, although we know how the mission will end, it is still a gripping tale. Thanks to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, the film looks good with a lot of attention to period detail, but there are a couple of contemporary political messages here. The first is clear: in the face of a war (whether the cold war or the war on terror), we should not abandon our ""rulebook"" (that is, our protection of liberty). The other message might be unintentional: just as the East Germans build a wall and fortifications to prevent their citizens from seeking freedom and prosperity in the West, so Europe today - but notably not Germany itself - is erecting fences to present Syrian and other refugees from their efforts to flee another form of totalitarian rule.","

We were both enthralled by this based on a true story of Hanks' James Donovan-an insurance lawyer who previously was involved in the Nuremberg trials-and his attempt to first defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance who gave a performance worthy of his Oscar win) and then fostering an exchange with Russia and East Germany to trade Abel for pilot Francis Gary Powers and student Frederic Pryor, respectively. It was fascinating finding out later how much of the movie was historically accurate, turns out quite a bit. Some scenes would be considered shocking but this was mostly carried by compelling dialogue of which much of it was by Joel and Ethan Coen. So on that note, me and Mom highly recommend Bridge of Spies.","

"Bridge of Spies","jeustace7","8 October 2015","I know that a portion of my positive experience in viewing this film came from the fact that I was privileged enough to see an advance screening attended by the Secretary of the Air Force, Francis Gary Powers Jr. (son of the U2 pilot downed in the USSR), and an AF Colonel who flew the U2 for the making of this film. All three spoke before the film and they had many warm words for Steven Spielberg's professionalism and his appreciation for uniformed service-members. Apparently Spielberg's father visited Russia during the Cold War and served as a radio operator in the military at some point- giving Spielberg a personal reason to ""get things right"" in the movie. I thought the film's strongest point was its edifying, anti-xenophobic message. Tom Hanks plays a kind of Atticus Finch in the face of McCarthy-style anti-Russian public sentiment. The (french?) recurring epithet for Hank's Character's resolve ""stoique majete"" (sp?) reminded me of the yiddish concept of a ""mensch."" And that's not too surprising seeing as the Coen Brothers co-wrote the script. Though there was no spiritual theme to the movie, I couldn't help but thinking of 1 Peter 5:6 ""Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time."" This would apply to Tom Hank's unassuming character who is elevated to more and more influential positions simply because he is faithful in the tasks he is given. Very refreshing to see a ""reluctant hero"" as realistic as this. Just a man willing to do the right thing even when it's unpopular. Definitely echoes of Oscar Schindler, one of Spielberg's previous protagonists. Also had a couple scenes that reminded me of Munich, though this film is much more enjoyable. Last thing I'll say is that I enjoyed a number of the casting decisions. Don't know that I could name any of the actors outside of Hanks, but it made the film so much more fun to have a strong actor in the role of the Russian spy (the relationship that develops between Hanks and the spy is really fun to watch). Hank's character's wife plays a small part but does a great job of portraying stern, loving concern without becoming grating. Honestly thought Powers (the downed pilot) could have been a little more two-dimensional, but the movie is clearly ""not about him"" so the movie didn't suffer and he had enough aw-shucks-young-american-in-the-60's to make him likable. Hank's one line to him is priceless. Such a relief to have a summary of the film's themes delivered in such an effortless way. Great film! And it got a thumbs-up from the downed-pilot's son in terms of historical accuracy (obviously some details changed for screenplay's sake). Enjoy!","

In the film, the mass of historical and factual errors, and the film is not a history of the spy Rudolf Abel and his exchange on pilot Francis Gary Powers, and a pretentious propaganda picture.It all started back in the Spielberg movie ""Terminal"", but in this movie took a truly catastrophic proportions. Spielberg does not have a clue about life in the USSR and the GDR, and all of his view of life in these countries is based on a picture of the American propaganda magazines and newspapers of the time (ie, during the Cold War. Who started the United States and its allies, and the Warsaw Pact was created as a response against the NATO alliance. And the plan of offensive war in Europe, originally did not belong to the Soviet Union and the United States and the United Kingdom).If you are interested in the history of flying spy plane U-2 over the Soviet Union and the subsequent exchange of Francis Gary Powers to the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, see the Soviet movie ""Dead Season"". It is much better to do than this fake of Spielberg. In addition, in this old Russian movie authentic costumes, interiors and uniforms of the period. Unlike Spielberg film in which nothing is authentic, except for helmets GDR Army.By the way, Francis Gary Powers voluntarily told all in captivity, without tortures and horrors in ""Spilberg style"". Upon returning to the US, he was accused that not blew himself up along with the aircraft at ejection (under catapult CIA profit laid an explosive charge) and that did not take the poisoned needle for suicide (Francis Powers voluntarily gave the needle during the arrest).If you interesting to see a movie about Powers, watch Soviet movie ""We accuse"" (1985). As far as I know, in the United States was no movie about Francis Gary Powers. Although he fulfilled his soldier duty to the end, and died like a hero - rescuing children from falling helicopter.This movie - 0 from 10.","

He's so mysterious. You always want to know what is going on with that guy! I just loved his fake befuddlement near the beginning of the movie when the CIA bust in on him. Great stuff.Third - Hanks. Tom Hanks does a bang up job giving this character real humanity. He turns him into a real person...as much as he can, since there is not much of a real person in the way the character was written. Another one of Spielberg's stalwart heroes. Dull as dishwater - except for the fact that Hanks wrestles the human being out of the flat script.So now onto the stuff that bugs me - let's start with the ending. Seriously, this movie could have ended 10 minutes earlier. Why oh why does S.S. have to always put those crappy endings on his movies? Hero comes home to wide-eyed adoring wife and/or children. And I'm a bit tired of these cypher-like, no-personality wives in these stupid movies.Was the wife really part of the story? No, so it is not necessary to cram that character in there being all 50s wife-ish and yelling about what it's all DOING TO THE FAMILY and all that other trite crap. Since no women were actually involved in this story - historically - it's OKAY to not try to shoehorn a female character into it. We women won't get all offended! We'd much prefer you just leave out the doting wife crap altogether. And leave the precocious interactions with the son out too, please. Why is this stuff always in an S.S. movie? Every. Damn. Time.Was there a point to having Alan Alda show up for 5 minutes to be a dick? And why set up this whole thing with the young man who was going to assist Donovan with the case and then the character just...disappears. Could S.S. cast someone even REMOTELY interesting to play Powers? And was all of New York really all reading the same newspaper and staring Donovan down on the subway? I really hate these dumb, made-up movie scenarios. Finally, nobody ever shot up Donovan's house. You really lose your credibility when you spice up the truth with bull-dooky incidents.(As long as we are on that vein...did people in the late 50s/early 60s watch as much television as the family in this movie does? Wouldn't the little ones be outside playing stickball? Wouldn't the teen girl be up in her room playing 45s?)It wasn't torturous to watch this movie. But it was just a movie. What it mostly did was spur you onto the internet to read about the real people and the real incidents. But as you are sitting and watching and getting curious about ""the real story"" you will find yourself rolling your eyes a lot.","

"Bridge of Spies","palavitsinis","19 September 2016","After watching Sully, I went back to see some movies with Tom Hanks that I had skipped. Bridge of Spies was brilliant. The way in which a civilian, although a lawyer, was dragged into this whole thing and the way in which he handled it, was amazing and thrilling to watch. Mark Rylance was also breathtaking in his role as Rudolf Abel. The movie had a really nice plot behind it, amazing scenery and photography in general, and it did keep you at the edge of your seat. It was quite long, but still I felt like it could have used some extra time towards the end. My favorite moments were of course towards the end of the movie, when all loose ends are tied up one way or the other. Overall it was a performance by all actors but also by Tom Hanks in particular that was up there with all the major roles he has portrayed so far.","

"Bridge of Spies","metalrox_2000","24 November 2015","History comes alive with Bridge of Spies. Mark Rylance is excellently cast as Rudolph Able, by all appearances, a kindly man who just wishes to be alone with his paint set. Appearances are deceiving, as we learn he is actually a Russian spy. Playing out as a secondary story, we watch as Francis Gary Powers is selected to fly a US plane in order to gather intelligence on Russia. Given a poison to take should he be captured, Powers realizes how dangerous a mission he was about to undertake.James Donovan is charged with the task of providing Able a suitable defense, not unlike John Adams had been called to do nearly two hundred years before with the Red Coats who fired into the crowd at Boston. Donovan loses in court, but is able to spare Able's life, citing that killing him would only incite hostilities against the US by Russia.Powers' mission is a failure as he is shot down, and tortured by the Russians. To add to the events, the Berlin Wall is going up in Germany, causing strife in that country as well. Fredric Pryor, an American college student studying abroad, is taken prisoner. Sent under orders to do an even change, Able for Powers, Donovan doesn't like the idea of leaving an American behind.To the dismay of the US Government, Donovan begins to set negations to get both Pryor and Powers, telling the Russians that they won't get Able if the US doesn't get both of their citizens back. The drama intensifies as it appears Germany may balk at the suggestion of giving up Pryor.The events come to ahead on a snowy bridge, as Able and Powers stand on opposite sides of the bridge, not knowing if they would step foot on the homeland again. At the last second, the Germans show up at Checkpoint Charlie with Pryor, and the exchange is made, and Donovan is happy with his success, yet worried about Able's fate, as the two have become friends amongst the madness of world politics.The brisk pace of the movie, as well as the engaging characters make this a must see movie. Alan Alda proves he still has it, even though he appears briefly in the film. Both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance both forth such amazing performances, that both should be considered Oscar worthy.It's next to impossible to make a suspenseful film about a historical event of which you already know the outcome. Yet Spielberg is able to do just that. This is a true must see film! 10 out of 10.","

"Bridge of Spies","RNMorton","23 October 2015","Hanks plays lawyer and former counsel for the OSS who represents Soviet spy Rudolph Abel on espionage charges, and is then asked to broker a deal permitting Abel to return to Russia for the release of Francis Gary Powers, captured U-2 spy plane pilot. I have a natural distrust of Spielberg, most recently from the fictional War Horse, for being overly manipulative with his audiences. I have checked the basic facts behind this movie and they appear legit. If the movie was confirmed on a few other points I would give this a 10 without reservation. Sorry, for me historical movies (and particularly Biblical movies) need to be accurate - subtle deviations from the truth can (to me) create false impressions. As it is Hanks and Rylance (as Abel) are just superb, Hanks seems made for Spielberg's sort of movies. The period work is very impressive and cinematography superb. The story starts slowly but once things get going it moves along very well. This has the feel of Oscar work, just an impressive movie.","

"Bridge of Spies","SimonJack","11 July 2017","""Bridge of Spies"" is a first rate film about three true events that occurred at the height of the Cold War (1946-1991). They were headline news stories of their day. The first two incidents were unrelated but were tied together by the third event. Director Steven Spielberg and the writing team had a tough job condensing three stories over five years into a film of less than 2½ hours. They had to skip much detail, and the film seems crammed in places. Some things may not be apparent to one who doesn't know the history. The first event was the 1957 New York arrest, trial and conviction of Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy. The second event was the 1960 crash of an American spy plane over Russia and the arrest, trial and conviction of the pilot, Francis Gary Powers. The third event was the 1962 prisoner exchange of the two men, along with a second American. The first and last of these three events involve a third principal character, James Donovan, a New York attorney. The film revolves around Donovan and his role in the lives of the captive men. All of the cast are superb in their roles. The film naturally had Hollywood treatment, so some parts are fiction. Folks interested in the Cold War, or in espionage, or Soviet spying in particular, might enjoy more details. So, I offer some here from my study of these subjects. Rudolf Abel was one of many aliases of Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (1903-1971). Fisher was an English-born Russian. He moved to Russia in the 1920s, served in the military and became a Soviet intelligence officer. After World War II, he joined the KGB and was trained to spy in the U.S. He left Russia in 1948. Using different IDs and passports, he made his way across Europe to Canada and then the U.S. on Nov. 17. He operated in a spy ring under the code name, Mark. When things heated up, he was about to leave the U.S. with a new ID. But, he was arrested before he could leave. That was June 21, 1957.The film gives a sense of intrigue with Abel's capture. It didn't happen the way the movie portrays it. He answered the door in his hotel room and was arrested by FBI agents. But the scenes with a hollow nickel were one way to bring into the story a real aspect that led to Abel's capture. In 1953, a Brooklyn newspaper boy received a hollow nickel for payment when he was collecting for his paper route. He dropped the coin and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm. It wound up in the hands of the FBI. In time, through trailing other known Soviet spies, and the defection of one in May of 1957, the feds were able to corral Abel. The federal court in New York convicted him of spying and sentenced him to 30 years in prison. He had served just over four years in an Atlanta prison, when he was exchanged in 1962 for Gary Powers. Back home in Russia, Fisher lectured on his experiences until he died at age 68 in 1971.Francis Gary Powers (1929-1977) was a U.S. Air Force jet pilot during 1952-56. He was discharged from the Air Force as a captain in 1956, and went to work for the CIA to fly U-2 missions over the Soviet Union. Those began on Sept. 27, 1956 and continued into 1960. On May 1 of that year, Powers was shot down by a new Soviet ground to air missile, and parachuted to safety. On Aug. 19, the Soviet Union convicted him of espionage and sentenced him to three years in prison and seven years of hard labor. He served just over 21 months in prison before the February 10, 1962 exchange. The movie doesn't show it, but the Powers family and two American attorneys were at his trial.In later years, Powers received honors for his service. Soviet records released after the fall of the Iron Curtain verified the details Power had given of his U-2 flight. Powers died on Aug. 1, 1977 when his TV traffic helicopter crashed in Los Angeles. While making an emergency landing, he swerved to avoid hitting children playing in a park. James Donovan (1916-1970) took the Abel case after several others had turned it down. He had been in a private law firm just seven years after serving as a commander in the Navy. During World War II, he was associate counsel in a research and development office. After the war, he was assistant to Justice Robert H. Jackson, the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg war trials in Germany. Donovan was the main negotiator in the prisoner exchange of Abel and Powers, which also included an American student, Frederic Pryor. While the movie doesn't cover it, Donovan's efforts that same year and the next for Cuban exiles were as harrowing as his negotiations with the Soviets. In June, exiled Cubans asked him to negotiate the release of the Cuban Americans captured by Fidel Castro after the failed April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The negotiations concluded on July 3, 1963, and led to the release of about 1,100 people. Donovan was just 53 years old when he died of a heart attack in January 1970. A 1976 TV movie was made about Gary Powers. Lee Majors starred in ""Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident."" A 1948 movie, ""The Iron Curtain,"" stars Dana Andrews as Igor Gouzenko. He was a Soviet crypto clerk who defected and exposed a massive spy network in Canada and the U.S. The Soviets were way ahead of the U.S. in their espionage work after WW II and during the early years of the Cold War.","

"Bridge of Spies","maurice_yacowar","5 November 2015","Worried but smiling, Mary Donovan sees her husband off on his secret mission to East Berlin: ""Can't you give me something to go on? I don't even care if it's not true."" As the stay at home, perky wife, Mary doesn't have much role in the action — but that line strikes to the heart of Stephen Spielberg's Bridge of Spies. As insurance lawyer James Donovan learns when he's introduced to the web of lies woven by the Russian, American and East German governments, everyone indulges each other's fictions.When Donovan negotiates the exchange of Russian spy Rudolf Abel for the U2 pilot Gary Powers and a hapless American economics student taken prisoner in East Berlin, he finds layer upon layer of fiction. All the agents lie and hide. Actors are presented as Abel's family. The lawyer Vogel proves a rare bird, elusive in flight and of ambiguous power and role when finally spotted. Nobody is who they seem to be. The CIA enlists Donovan as negotiator because the swap is too touchy for governments to negotiate. Only Donovan refuses to lie. Mary doesn't believe his cover — the company sending him to Europe for clients — but even to assuage her fears all he says is ""I'm doing this for us."" They go through the marmalade game to confirm her confidence. The metaphor extends even further. When Donovan defends the Russian spy, when he enforces the Americans' guarantee of justice, he offends all America. Vigilante citizens shoot up Donovan's home. A cop turns against him, preferring to persecute rather than to protect him. The lawyers and judge want to present just the appearance of a fair trial — precisely what we disdain in the Russian autocracy. Donovan is totally invested in the moral principles of US justice, which the other lawyers, the judge and the embittered frightened citizens are all too willing to scuttle. Only by appealing to the judge's self-interest does Donovan manage to avoid his client's death sentence. The Golden Rule fails Donovan: Shouldn't we treat their spies as we would want them to treat ours? He wins by foreseeing the possibility of using Abel for an exchange the next time Russia catches an American spy. Pragmatism trumps principle. Tom Hanks's James Donovan is what the Russian spy Abel admires as ""the standing man,"" a character so strong of will and ideals that he stands by them whatever the cost and challenge. After the swap Donovan appears standing still solid — but dwarfed by the machinery of the bridge that looms black and impersonal over him. When he finally collapses on his bed at home, exhausted, he's still in that standing pose, though splayed out horizontal. The political chill of the Cold War permeates the West, as we see in the school kids' oath of allegiance and Duck and Cover drill, and in the sniffly cold that starts with Abel, overwhelms Donovan when a German gang steals his Saks Fifth Avenue overcoat, and passes on to the CIA agent. The white hanky signifies the characters' surrender to the era's paranoia, cruelty and abandonment of American values.That's what makes this film about now as much as then. The film addresses the current threat, America abandoning its values in their supposed defence against a monster enemy, whether their Communism or our current bogey, radical Islam. ""There's no book of rules,"" the CIA agent tells Donovan, attempting to violate the client-lawyer relationship. There is, Donovan reminds him — the constitution. Of course, the Supreme Court is split down the middle on what the constitution was intended to advance. But the principles of freedom, justice, protection of the individual, should guard against the system's corrupt pragmatism. That's the gist of Donovan's terse but resonant address to the Supreme Court. His appeal fails on the familiar 5-4 count. Bridge of Spies reminds us all of what distinguished America and made her a beacon for humanity worldwide. It also warns us how easy it is to abandon those values in the name of defending them. On the train home Donovan shows a flicker of disturbance when he sees American teenagers playfully leaping over backyard high wire fences. He's remembering the young people shot dead trying to leap the Berlin Wall? He's remembering his close call when he was threatened and robbed by the East Berliners? He sees the spectre of the fascist society in America? We're reminded that however great our social and political differences, we and our enemies are equally tempted to abandon our values for expediency. That's when we indulge our own fictions, which is even more dangerous than indulging each other's.","

"Bridge of Spies","gradyharp","14 February 2016","The setting for this based on a true story film is the 10950s – that tense period when in America children were put through classroom drills in case of an expected (or rather, feared) nuclear attack form Russia. Most people had bomb shelters stocked with supplies for the propaganda response that the Cold War ruled everyone's thinking. Remember those days? If not then this film will most assuredly force you to stare at the anxiety that ruled the politics and the military and the populace during that awful time.Steven Spielberg directs a script created by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman and has engaged a splendid cast that offers many insights into the thinking of that period. The story (for those who are shaky on facts and dates) is as follows: 'In the cold war, an insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II, is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers (Austin Stowell) who was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission- with a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) who was arrested for espionage in the US. The strong anti- Communist mood at the time makes him a target from those (the general populace) who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. And of course Donovan's theory works, emphasizing the humanity that can resist fear of the unknown in the time of Cold War. The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Alan Alda, Sebastian Koch, Amy Ryan and of course Hanks and Rylance. Superb script, well re-enactment of an ugly part of our history, and some fine nuances about faith in the democratic system make this one of the finest films of the year.","

"Bridge of Spies","tomgillespie2002","31 January 2016","Steven Spielberg's latest exercise in good ol' fashioned American wholesomeness, integrity and diplomacy transports us back to 1957, where undercover KGB agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is about to be busted by the FBI under suspicion of passing secrets onto the Soviets. The idealistic man at the centre of the story is James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer working in Brooklyn who joins the likes of John Quincy Adams, Oskar Schindler and Abraham Lincoln on the list of great, conflicted men caught up in a difficult period of upheaval and portrayed by Spielberg in an admiring light. And who better to play a man of such a clear sense of morality than Hollywood's favourite nice-guy Tom Hanks?Working with frequent collaborator Janusz Kaminski, Bridge of Spies is about a good-looking as a film gets. Infused with the same eye for detail and greyed-down solemnity of Lincoln (2012), the backdrops on show provide the perfect location for serious men talking serious business. The main crux of the film rests in the blossoming friendship between Donovan and Abel, who are captured on an equal par in a bleak interrogation room as the sun blazes through the blinds. These are two men from opposing sides, but share the share the same determination, stubbornness, and loyalty to the ideals of their country. Abel accepts his increasingly-likely execution as one of the requirements of his job, but Donovan wants to exercise his rights as a PoW, making himself public enemy number one in the process as his face splashes across the newspapers.Donovan also hopes to keep him as a tool should the need for a prisoner exchange rear its head in the future, which was incredible foresight for anyone who knows the true-life story. As Donovan fights for Abel in the courtroom, the United States are prepping their own mission - to send a spy plane over the Soviet Union to take photographs. Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is shot down and, after failing to swallow the cyanide given to him by his commanding officer in case he finds himself in such a perilous position, is taken prisoner by the Soviets and routinely tortured for information. The U.S. government again turn to Donovan in the hope of setting up an exchange just as American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) is also arrested.For a story so littered with intrigue and espionage, Bridge of Spies is oddly lacking in thrills and tension. When Donovan arrives for the exchange in Berlin as the Wall is being put in place, the city is hostile and seemingly lawless in areas, but instead the film focuses on the various bizarre characters, including a Petter Lorre- alike KGB man, who flock around Donovan, a man they simply do not know. Perhaps the unevenness in tone is down to a script-polishing by Joel and Ethan Coen, who never shy away from taking a genre and stamping their own particular brand of humour on it. Spielberg also cannot resist resorting to sentiment at the film's climax on the eponymous 'bridge of spies' (Glienicke Bridge). Still, this is Spielberg at his most professional, harking back to classic Hollywood while maintaining the relevance of the films themes.","

"Bridge of Spies","AmyJenson1995","23 February 2016","Who said that a thriller has to be violent to be considered as successful? Bridge of Spies is a smart movie about the Gary Powers affair, a dramatic event which could have become the spark of a destructive conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.Despite what the title may suggest, Bridge of Spies is not a movie about espionage. Don't expect to see thrilling chases, firefights or anything we could see in James Bond or Mission Impossible. This movie is about the real story of the efforts of one man, Jim Donovan, a Brooklyn lawyer specialized in insurance issues, who became involved in spite of himself in the most sensitive crisis of that time and, by using his negotiating skills, is trying to settle peacefully the crisis by organizing an exchange between Powers and a Soviet spy who was arrested prior to the crash of the U2.Once again, Tom Hanks is playing with perfection this role of a man who put his reputation, his life and his family's in line by defending a Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (played admirably by Mark Rylance) because he truly believes that anybody, whatever the charges are against him or her, deserves the right to be defended.Mark Rylance is also perfect impersonating Rudolf Abel. His performance is very sober and I have some sympathy for the character. As Donovan says in the movie, Abel is just a loyal soldier of his country and he should not be branded as a traitor as many did back in that time.But what gives to this movie all its credits is its sobriety and objectivity depicting the tension between the two sides back in that era, the hypocrisy of both judicial system including ours who wants the world to be considered as a model of justice but in reality are ready to deny the values of our country by violating the Constitution and depriving Abel of his basic right to defend himself.There are some scenes who literally broke my heart. I had tears watching Jim's son filling the bathtub of water because in school he learned that the first basic needs which couldn't be able to be fulfilled in case of a nuclear bombardment will be electricity and water or when those two people got shot to death while trying to climb the Berlin wall and escape the oppressive Soviet regime. I looked up and it turned out that more than 200 people were gunned down trying to escape including women.So yes maybe some would have preferred an action movie but for the ones who prefers a realistic recalling of the facts like myself will really appreciate this picture. We need more movies like Bridges of spies. Movies who can give you a realistic insight of what was going on. In that matter Bridge of spies is accomplishing its mission very perfectly.","

"Bridge of Spies","dave-mcclain","16 October 2015","A friend of mine recently posted on Facebook that his daughter had asked him who played the character called Hawkeye. ""Alan Alda,"" was my friend's reply, thinking of the surgeon on TV's ""M*A*S*H"". But my friend's daughter was asking about the Marvel Comics character in the ""Avengers"" films (played by Jeremy Renner). Besides amusing me, that little story got me thinking about how I was going to write my review of Steven Spielberg's historical drama ""Bridge of Spies"" (PG-13, 2:21). If I'm going to discuss a movie in which ""The U-2 Incident"" plays such a big part, it might be a good idea to point out that this reference has nothing to do with ticket scalping at a rock concert or anything of the sort. In fact, to better appreciate this review and, more importantly, Spielberg's film, you might want to do what I just did – reinforce and add to your historical knowledge of the aforementioned Cold War crisis, the Hollow Nickel Case and Rudolf Abel, Francis Gary Powers and James Donovan. Or you could just read my review and then go to the film, not just for a great cinematic history lesson but to see one terrific movie.Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer in the 1950s. Donovan is smart, honest, hard-working and, most importantly, he has principles and integrity – especially when it comes to the law. He has also served his country in uniform and assisted in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials. Donovan's law firm's senior partner (played, coincidentally, by the same Alan Alda mentioned in my previous paragraph) asks him to accept the thankless task of defending accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (multiple Tony Award winner Mark Rylance).Donovan is understandably less than enthusiastic about all of this, but his sincere belief that ""everyone deserves a defense"" leads him to take the case. In spite of (and because of) his patriotism, he represents this obviously guilty spy as zealously and ethically as he represents all his clients. In the vehement and almost universal anti-communism of 1950s America, Donovan runs down every ground ball, making him one of the most hated men in America – and even endangering his family. His wife (Amy Ryan) supports him throughout the case, but she has some trouble understanding the lengths that he goes to for Abel.Fast-forward a few years. Abel is still in prison, and Donovan brings him a letter supposedly from his wife in the U.S.S.R. The letter amounts to a back-channel proposal from the Soviets to discuss trading Abel for recently captured U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). C.I.A. director Allen Dulles personally asks Donovan to negotiate the swap – but as a private citizen, NOT as a representative of the U.S. government. Telling his wife he's going on a business trip to London, Donovan heads to East Berlin, just as the politically divided city is being physically divided by the construction of the Berlin Wall.With a C.I.A. employee (Scott Shepherd) briefing and supporting him, but needing to otherwise keep his distance, Donovan begins his dangerous mission. Navigating check points and a street gang, he walks alone from West to East Berlin for an appointment inside the Soviet embassy. He meets unofficially with another man to, as Donovan says, ""have the conversation that our governments can't"". Further complicating an already tenuous negotiation is Donovan's personal decision to insist that the prisoner swap include an innocent American university student recently detained by East German authorities. Clearly, it's going to take every ounce of Donovan's intelligence, skill and nerve to accomplish his objectives, not the least of which is avoiding getting shot or even detained and put on trial himself.""Bridge of Spies"" is that rare movie that can make history come to life and give it the immediacy of a first-class cinematic drama/thriller. Of course, there are those (as two people behind me in the theater seemed to do) who will walk out of a movie if it isn't very quickly filled with explosions, murders or at least a good chase scene, but short-sighted individuals like that miss an opportunity to enjoy the artistry of well-crafted stories that, sadly, are not as common as they used to be. This entire cast is exceptional, especially Hanks, who is as at the top of his game in full-on thinking man's ""boy scout"" mode, and Mark Rylance who deserves significant awards season recognition and, of course, the always impressive Ryan.I should mention that the Cold War intrigue highlighted in the film's trailers is all in the second half of the film, but the script, co-written by Matt Charman and none other than Ethan and Joel Coen, is smart and compelling throughout. That story, coupled with Spielberg's expert touch, impressively recalls a time and tone that few Americans still remember, while giving us the twin dramas of a Soviet spy in the U.S. and a downed U.S. pilot in the Soviet Union. These two tales are seamlessly woven together and perfectly edited. The film also reminds us that what makes all of us Americans are not the political or religious beliefs we hold, but the principles we all stand for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is as American as apple pie and about as rewarding an experience as anyone, regardless of nationality, could hope a film to be. ""A""","

Rather its valued; perhaps, one of the important outcomes of watching this drama-caper.Based on the negotiations for American-Soviet spy exchange of ""Powers for Abel"", and the craftsmanship of American insurance lawyer, James Donovan.Only when one started to think that it would be a regular, even a little banal-looking account of some Cold War events, it came out to be not just different but a lot better than imagined. Surprisingly comical, this politically paced drama-thriller keeps one hooked for more than usual reasons - which has now become a typical attribute of a Steven Spielberg film, and doesn't stop surprising.Tom Hanks, with his effortless portrayal of Donovan, and the ""staggeringly sharp"" Mark Rylance as the Russian Spy Rudolf Abel - remarkably contribute in the film's subtle nod to the spirit of resilience and men of courage. As aptly stated in a Russian phrase for ""Standing Man"" - of virtue, of missions, of patriotism and of the families.Watchable, enjoyable, and likable! Clear 8/10","

"Bridge of Spies","oscaralbert","19 October 2015",". . . actually believe that they should uphold the American Constitution in practice (if even in theory). Spielberg proves many if not most American law enforcement and military officers, prosecutors, judges, and lawmakers perjure themselves when they take their oaths of office to live at U.S. taxpayer expense. Crooked FBI and CIA agents, prosecutors, judges, and cops abound in Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES. All of them apparently had their fingers crossed behind their backs when they were sworn into their offices, thinking that they will ""uphold the Constitiution"" only when it's convenient and profitable to themselves to do so, treating it like toilet paper whenever it conflicts with their personal agendas, profit motives, idiosyncratic belief structures, or if they feel a sudden urge to enjoy an ""opposite day"" at the Constitution's expense (not unlike most of the officials depicted in the current release, BLACK MASS). I say, cut the hypocrisy now! Things have gotten much worse in America since 1957, when the BRIDGE OF SPIES story begins. Let President Obama make it official, and tear up that ratty old parchment signed by James Madison & Co. on a live national TV broadcast. Follow up this PURGE-with-a-purpose by letting the Walton Family, whose Wal-Mart Co. just had a really bad week, dash off a New Constitution everyone can believe in, as a gesture which says, ""Thanks for all the fish!""","

"Bridge of Spies","cagebox111","2 May 2022","Bridge of Spies is a fantastical movie and the second-best collaboration between Spielberg and Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan has to be #1). Bridge of Spies tells the real story of a lawyer who is called on to represent a Soviet Spy in the heart of the Cold War. Though much of the movie concerns a hostage exchange and is tense and interesting, I found the actual trial and ethical complications around the trial the most interesting. At the time, America was anticipating a nuclear war with the hated Soviets and the thought of representing the captured spy in court must have been a daunting one. The movie stands up for the Constitution and holds dear to American ideals that make the country the great nation it is.","

"Bridge of Spies","orkunkeskin","17 May 2016","Beside the good acting of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, there isn't many good things about this movie. Tom Hanks appears as a symbol of 'great' America, doing the right things one after another, even though the authorities are against it (like it is possible for him to act so independent) to symbolize how 'great' is the US.On the other hand Soviets are the evils as usual. Tortures against American soldier/spy, hostile military officers even against their own spy ( while American soldier does the exact opposite), scared children that got education at school about nuclear war (ironically with the footage of nuclear experiments that US did) and many other things that show how evil the Soviet was. But the American side had right causes to act unjust (not evil, just unjust) because they are patriots which is a good thing.To summarize, it is all about taking necessary dosage of American propaganda with some good acting.","

"Bridge of Spies","nclka1990","4 February 2016","Steven Spielberg does not make bad films. Okay, admitted there might be one or two exceptions (I'm looking at you Crystal Skull!). However, he has not made a really good film since Munich in 2005. With Bridge of Spies he returns to a well-known arena for him with a story centred around the defense trial of a Soviet spy caught in Cold War America and the subsequent prisoner exchange with the Soviet Union and German Democratic Republic. Teaming up with the Coen Brothers as the film's writers, masterful composer Thomas Newman and regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has probably made his best film in 10 years!The story is divided in two: the first half centred around the trial of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and the second half focusing on the proposed prisoner exchange with the USSR and GDR. The first half is small-scale courtroom drama where we get to see the political idealism and propaganda originally behind the American defense of the most hated man on US soil. The courtroom scenes and portrayal of the actual trial might be the film's weakest asset feeling rushed and unimportant. The real drama in this first part lies in the chemistry and increasing relation between Rudolf Abel and Tom Hanks' lawyer James B. Donovan and the study of the personal consequences of this for Donovan's private life. Especially the chemistry between Tom Hanks and the impeccable Mark Rylance as Abel is a joy to behold. Highly acclaimed stage actor Rylance's performance is one of the best supporting roles I have seen in years. He underacts Abel perfectly and he becomes the image of the hopelessness that were everywhere in these times. Donovan keeps asking Abel if he never worries and before Rylance can say 'Would it help?' we already know that this is Abel's view on it; he is way past that point. Hanks also delivers his best performance in years as the idealistic yet vulnerable Donovan and especially in the scenes with his family he shows that he is one of the best to portray the ordinary man. Roughly half way through the film, though, we leave the small-scale setting of the courtrooms, the prison cells and the living room as Donovan is sent on a secret mission to East Berlin to negotiate the exchange of Abel for by-the-soviets-captured American soldier Francis Gary Powers. The story of Powers prior to his capture feels weirdly out of place, but as the story unfolds this actually makes sense. In this exchange drama (that suddenly includes an American student held by GDR too btw) the persons captured does not matter in the bigger picture. It is all about showing the public that you do not leave people behind - the return of Powers is to become the symbol of the American power in the cold war! The most interesting asset of the film's second part is its portrayal of the very dawn of a physically divided Berlin. This is the dawn of the Wall, the dawn of 'us' and 'them'! Spielberg portrays the small-scale horrors and the grand scale political drama of this situation with such respect that it is close to becoming predictable.What ultimately saves the day for Spielberg (apart from tremendous performances from Hanks and Rylance) is sheer sense and amount of quality. The cinematography of Kaminski is grand when it needs to be and hauntingly gruesome in its simplicity when showing the horrors of Eastern Berlin. (Here, a certain train ride is in particular touching!). The score from Thomas Newman is classic and without surprises but as with the rest of the machinery it is simply just of the highest quality and fits perfectly in every scene. Finally, the script by Ethan and Joel Coen balances perfectly between the little drama, the grand thriller and some refreshing comedic scenes and pieces of dialogue. The film is a showpiece of how you construct a well-working film. It lacks the final surprise or courage to become a masterpiece like Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, but if everything in Hollywood were to collapse this film stands as an example of why Spielberg will always get back up and be the standing man.","

"Bridge of Spies","brutzel","5 February 2016","In the late 1950s insurance lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is tasked by the CIA with defending Russian spy Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance) in a U.S. court of law. Later Donovan is tasked with negotiating the swap of Abel for downed U.S. U2 (spy plane) pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). Then Donovan learns of an American Economics student, Frederick Pryor (Will Rogers) held by the Russians and wants to do a 2-for-1 deal that the CIA is against. The CIA just wants Powers. Here we go.The only action scenes show the U2 spy plane being hit by Russian missiles and Gary Powers trying to reach the plane's self destruct button. These scenes are extremely good. Other than those brief action scenes, this is a talk-fest, but the conversations don't drag and are very concise among the Russians, the East Germans (this was the time the Berlin Wall went up), the CIA, some other U.S. government officials and James Donovan.The most engaging scenes are between Rudolph Abel and Donovan and they are excellent as the dialogues were spot on. When Donovan asks Abel why he doesn't show that he is worried Abel replies, "" Would it help?"" It wouldn't surprise me if Mark Rylance as Abel is nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Award. He is really good. This was history being made and this story is well told. There is nothing complicated and you always know what is going on. However, I was not aware that Donovan also wanted to get Pryor out of Russia as part of the deal. Tom Hanks as James Donovan in this role is perfect. As always.Unlike most spy stories, there really is no tension in here, but there is some suspense later on when the spy swap is supposed to take place at the Glienicke Bridge and at Checkpoint Charlie. Oh, oh.Notables: Alan Alda, Jesse PlemonsAll in all, well told and now you know the rest of the story. Stay tuned to the ending when the credits run to find out what happened to everyone. (8/10)Violence: Yes, some not much. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Two F-bombs only; and brief small stuff.","

"Bridge of Spies","AudioFileZ","24 October 2015","The first crisis of the cold war is hardly remembered as both The Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis have eclipsed the debacle of captured U2 pilot Gary Powers and Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. Bridge of Spies, aptly named is Steven Spielberg's moving, and entertaining, big-screen correction of, perhaps, the mostly forgotten story of the first major diplomacy between the superpowers in the avoiding thermo-nuclear war.The story revolves around a somewhat obscure attorney and great American (at least prior to the events depicted) James Donovan. A brittle serendipitous stage of events, uniquely, fell into place as ""the sum of all fears"" began to reach a fever-pitch from which an unlikely chain of events thrust insurance attorney Donovan into the spotlight. It was not an enviable spotlight for Donovan as his only purpose was to avert any possibility of Rudolf Abel not being professionally represented in what could be an international incident.It was believed a swift and certain verdict of guilty with the death penalty would be reached justly. The message would be the U.S.A. is fair and just, but unwavering in intent. There was only one thing, Donovan was nobody's lackey.To James Donovan being a red-blooded American meant first and foremost upholding the constitution because it is what separated America from all other nations. Donovan believed any accused human, citizen or not, gets the rights guaranteed by the constitution in a U.S. court of law. While he didn't wholly succeed at first he set a series of events in motion that ended up defining post World War II détente. Spielberg masterly brings this story of a man who steps forward to embody something greater than himself at great cost. Fighting for something larger,he not only defines himself, but who we are as a nation. In the interim, before the righteousness the man stands on is actually embraced he may just be labeled a pariah, there's no doubt Donovan was being the target of many death threats. And without the lack of support from his family and employer. Slowly though his moral wisdom rises to save two men from prison and a nation from greater threat of nuclear war. This is a piece of American history very deserving to be retold, sure for entertainment, but also for our inspection. A real defining moment in history whose good set a precedent. This is, another of Tom Hank's finest moments. He captures the essence of a man whose time to become something more curiously fell into place. This, combined with the impeccable period sets and concisely powerful writing, make Bridge of Spies a very important movie that celebrates a lesser known historical event; an event which still defines how two mortal enemies can achieve a kind of peaceful outcome. I give this movie my highest recommendation and could care less even if there is slight artistic freedom interwoven; it gets the big things right and makes me proud. We need more men like James Donovan...maybe more than ever.","

"Bridge of Spies","ingmarbeldman-753-927212","15 February 2016","Name every aspect involving making a film and thumbs go up with this one.The master speaks, uses his skills to the sublime. No one doubts. Spielberg at his best. Right?Yes, but...1/3 courtroom, 2/3 cold war suspense. Thats a rough outline of the scrips structure. The latter would be deeply satisfying for it's exiting, sentimentally old- fashion, home- cooked cold-war-spy-movie grandeur. But it is not satisfying to me. Why? Because there is a 1/3 courtroom part that is so much more, so much more promising, so much more layered, with so many exiting set-ups, that i miss - i miss him more often these days - good old Clint Eatwood to bring all that complexity to a satisfying end. The first part is not about cold war, not about a spy and not about court. The fist part is about.....us. Us people in modern days turmoil , caught in the middle of international terrorist fear. In the middle of fear for Muslims, in the middle of fear for 'the other' human being, in the middle of group pressure, consensus, media hysteria, etc..... The first part is showing a hero who thinks for himself, who is not giving in to group- thinking, who dares to stand alone, who uses reason in the right way, who is a hero because he keeps his brain sound and clear, his private property, not owned by Apple, Google or God knows who..... All in the setting of the 50s. This 1/3 part promises a movie that uses a cold war concept to dig deeper into the psychology of group thinking and the harmful consequences of it.Instead, we turn to a good old spy movie, Spielberg forgets his million-dollar worth set-ups, leaves us alone with the moral expectations we developed and gives us goodies and baddies....with a twist, sure, but......Americans that think, act straight and...... Eurpoeans that act weird and confused.Great movie to watch, because it is nothing more than great popcorn. My favorite is white ceddar cheese btw...","

"Bridge of Spies","rusoviet","13 March 2016","...Spielberg's films do.Even allowing for the time (1957/62) difference (2014), the scenes reminded me of a 'stage set' - faux walls, sky etc.. In addition the award to Rylance wasn't warranted. His script was nearly a monotone and always let Spielberg make a bolshevik/red 'human'.The historic accuracy re. the second 'captive' 'Pryor', was false - another 'trick' by Spielberg to 'add' some human/family hook.A far better script would have added after successfully negotiating the exchange for Francis Gary Powers, Donovan's negotiated the freedom of initially 1,103 but expanded to 9,703 Cuban anti-Castro men women and children.With Spielberg, as with all Hollywood leftists, there is always the kid glove treatment of the horror of the reds, even allowing for the callous machine gunning of the fleeing East Germans over the wall. In Schindler's List, Spielberg made sure he got his anti-gun message in the final scene when the Jews are surrounded by the German SS guards and tell them (the Germans) to go. In the movie no one has firearms in reality the Jews did and had them pointed at the Germans.","

"Bridge of Spies","adrian-j-ng","5 December 2015","I personally felt this film was not to my taste. I went in expecting a nice meaty courtroom drama. Turned out it was something else entirely. Something bereft of any drama at all, really. This film is about a man who faces numerous obstacles that he needs to overcome in order to do the right thing. The problem is that each time he comes across an obstacle turns out all he has to do is simply ask someone to remove it for him! And for some reason they do it for him! Every single time! He does this over and over again throughout the film. It's ridiculous. If he can simply ask for whatever wants then there is nothing at stake. There is never any tension. I wish I had not wasted my money. And I wish I had instead sat at home watching a tin of beans heat up in a microwave. And because everyone knows you can't put metal things in a microwave, it would have at least provided more drama and more tension than the entirety of this very long and very boring film.","

"Bridge of Spies","aharmas","18 October 2015","It has become customary to expect the best from Steven Spielberg, the man behind so many classics in American cinema, and he keeps growing as an artist, always availing himself of the best team, and working along with them to give us the finest quality in the art of cinema. IN ""Bridge of Spies"" he has directed an old fashioned film which shows in precise detail how the art of diplomacy might not have been invented but fine tuned, with grace and good intentions. With the help of Tom Hanks, a great choice for the lead character, Spielberg takes on a trip to the past, to show us the world of politics and the Cold War in the 1950's. It's a time of fear and paranoia, a world that expects the worst and chases its own tail in order to find a solution that might not exist. Both Russia and the United States are expecting the worst. Regular people live in constant fear that today might be their last day. Kids receive training in school to get them ready for the moment the world will be destroyed, with everyone living in a cloud of atomic waste.One day a ""spy"" is detained by the FBI, and Hanks is hired to defend him, though it's just a charade since everyone knows the result before the case even goes to court. Somehow, Hanks predicts there are possibilities to allowing the prisoner to remain in jail. This sets off acts of violence against the defender for his anti patriotism. Without giving much away, he finds himself in the middle of international deals, with two partners going at each other when one feels the other is either outsmarting or slighting each other. Egos are bruised and soothed, and lives are in danger because arrangements are not that easy to make.Eventually, everything is resolved, not without last minute twists that could undo every bit of work. This is the time when Hank shines, by portraying that everyman persona that makes him so endearing and popular. He wins us over with his intelligence and his big heart. James Stewart was very good at playing this type, and his match is Hanks, a very talented actor who once again proves that with the help of a great team behind him, he has found his niche again, and we are given movie gold.""Spies"" brings back a world lone gone, with extreme detail going into his production and much care at the heart of the script. With every performer giving his best in order to fully realize a vision. The result is a classic, a film that makes us think and satisfies us.","

"Bridge of Spies","Tweekums","17 March 2017","Set at the height of the cold war Soviet spy Rudolf Abel is arrested in New York; nobody is keen to represent him in court but eventually James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer with previous experience at the Nuremberg trials, takes on the job. He is not expected to do much more than go through the motions but he is determined that Abel will represented to the best of his ability even if that makes him unpopular. Donovan is adamant that Abel must be given the best defence as demanded by the US Constitution not doing so would make America little better than countries that don't have fair trials. Somewhat inevitably Abel is found guilty but Donovan makes a very logical plea against the expected death sentence if for no other reason he should be kept alive so that the United States will have somebody to trade if one of their spies is caught by the Soviets. Not long afterwards just such an event happens when US pilot Gary Powers is shot down while flying a U2 spy plane high over the Soviet Union. Shortly afterwards another American is arrested on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain; this time a student in East Berlin. Donovan soon finds himself in Berlin, where he is to negotiate with the Soviets to exchange Abel for Powers however he wants both Powers and the student; it won't be easy though as the latter is held by the East Germans and the CIA aren't at all bothered about getting him back; they just want Powers before he cracks and starts to spill secrets about the U2 project.This is very much a film of two halves; both of them gripping. The first half is a court room drama where Donovan represents Abel to the best of his abilities even though it makes him very unpopular with a population that seems to think that anybody who represents a suspected spy is little better themselves; during this we also get scenes showing Powers entering the U2 programme and explanations of his mission before his eventual shooting down. These scenes serve to introduce the main characters and their situations but are still gripping in their own right. Tension raises significantly once the action moves to Berlin as it is made clear that if anything goes wrong while Donovan is in East Berlin he doesn't have any formal protection. There is a sense of anti-communist paranoia in America but this is nothing compared to the tension in East Berlin were people are being shot trying to cross the newly erected Berlin Wall. Tom Hanks does a great job as Donovan; an apparently ordinary man who has found himself in an extraordinary situation. Mark Rylance also stands out as Abel; a likable character with a dry sense of humour. Director Steven Spielberg does a fine job keeping the story gripping and capturing the feel of the era. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film.","

"Bridge of Spies","zkonedog","27 February 2017","The combination of director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks is almost certain to produce a quality product at the cinema. That's exactly what happens (again) with ""Bridge of Spies"". It probably won't be your favorite effort from either of those two film luminaries, but it is instead a quite, brooding tale about life and espionage during the Cold War.For a basic plot summary, ""Bridge of Spies"" tells the adapted-from-true-events story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer tapped to defend one of the most hated men in America, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is convicted of spying in our homeland for the Soviet Union. Donovan first fights for Abel's rights (when no one else will seem to, even in full breach of the law), then is sent to Russia in order to facilitate an espionage-laden exchange mission.The area in which ""Bridge of Spies"" works best is when it can relate the themes of the Cold War to everyday life, showing that the events around the world may change over time, but people's reactions to them are usually more predictable. The overwhelmingly negative and hateful response to Abel's more presence in the country is startlingly familiar to the country's response to people of Islamic faith after 9/11. Seemingly all rule of law (and even some of decency) was thrown out the window in favor of ""patriotic justice"". Early in the film, there is also a poignant angle dealing with how children are reacting to Cold War tensions. At school, they are taught to ""duck and cover"" in case of an Atomic explosion (right after reciting the pledge of allegiance, of course), and at home Donovan's children are all very conflicted about how he could possibly defend the ""Commie traitor"".Bolstering those themes is the expected brilliance from Hanks in the leading role. Here, he is very much akin to, say, Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", or the typical Jimmy Stewart ""defend peace and law at all costs"" type role. In a world turned upside-down with misinformation about the Communists and hatred about something that isn't probably understood, Hanks's Donovan is able to keep a level head and pursue the tasks that really seem to make a difference, such as diplomacy and preserving the rule of law.The only reason ""Bridge of Spies"" probably isn't even better is that the ""espionage stuff"" over in Russia, while still rather entertaining in general, isn't the highlight of this film. The themes in the first half or so of the movie, feating Donovan's interactions with his family and the Abel case, just work on a deeper level. It still turns out to be a pretty emotional and satisfying ending, but the time spent in Russia is where things tend to get a little formulaic or draggy. Again, nothing terrible, but enough for me to drop this to four stars instead of an all-out five.Overall, I enjoyed the deep themes and powerful messages of ""Bridge of Spies"", as well as the notable acting performances given. It is a movie that can really be enjoyed by anyone teenaged years and up, as it touches on so many distinct avenues to get its message across. That Cold War era is one that often doesn't get its ""fair shake"" in history books or curriculums, so it is nice to see Spielberg bring it to the masses.","

"Bridge of Spies","sol-","23 November 2015","Based on the true story of an American insurance lawyer who wound up negotiating spy exchanges during the Cold War, 'Bridge of Spies' does a sterling job depicting tensions and insecurities during one of the most volatile periods in US history. While the focus of the film is always the American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, the film successfully weaves in several subplots that hint at what it was like to live during the Cold War. Most potently, the lawyer's son becomes obsessed with preparing for nuclear disaster after watching one too many propaganda films at school. Not so successfully woven in are two subplots involving the men who Hanks has to negotiate getting back in exchange for a captured Russian spy. The time-line of events in the film is also a little incredulous; no sooner has Hanks pleaded for the Russian's spy life to be spared in case of prisoner exchange is a prisoner exchange suddenly put on the table. Never to mind, Mark Rylance is superb as the Russian spy who hilariously keeps asking ""would it help?"" whenever Hanks asks him if he is worried. In fact, there is quite a bit of oddball humour in the film (Burghart Klaussner answering the wrong phone, etc), which can probably be chalked up to the Coen Brothers script. Furthermore, one of the film's strongest assets is how it balances light humour and very grim drama. As icing on the cake, the film looks superb with accurate period sets/costumes and lots of fluid, mobile camera-work from Janusz Kaminski. Thomas Newman provides an effective score too in lieu of John Williams.","

"Bridge of Spies","vsks","26 October 2015","Stephen Spielberg's riveting new film portrays the real-life events and personalities that led to a historic U.S.-Soviet-East German prisoner exchange in the frozen depths of the Cold War. In 1962, in a divided Berlin, an accused Soviet spy is to be traded for two Americans, if all goes well. An off-the-books U.S. negotiator has led the Soviets and the East Germans separately to the brink of agreeing the exchange, but hostilities are strong, motives are complex, and success is far from guaranteed. Based on the 2010 Giles Whittell book of the same name, the story centers around the intertwined fates of William Fisher, born Rudolf Abel, a British-born KGB agent whom the FBI arrested in New York; Francis Gary Powers, U.S. pilot of a super-secret U-2 spy plane shot down while flying over Russia; and Frederic Pryor, an American graduate student who finds himself on the wrong side of the new Berlin Wall and in the hands of the Stasi, East Germany's notorious secret police. Spielberg tells these men's stories, but centers on the role of U.S. insurance attorney James Donovan in the negotiations. Donovan's role initially is to defend Abel in his trial on espionage charges. He takes on this thankless task, even though everyone in the country, including the judge in the case, believes Abel is guilty. However, American legal processes need to be followed, if only to show the world that every prisoner receives a fair trial (an ironic punctiliousness half a century later). Inevitably, Abel is convicted, but at least Donovan persuades the judge not to invoke the death penalty. It's a controversial choice for Donovan to decide to appeal the verdict, and one that puts himself—and perhaps his family and career—in some danger. When Powers's plane is shot down, the possibility of a prisoner swap is immediately seized upon by the CIA. They want Powers back. He knows too much. Donovan is asked to negotiate an Abel-Powers trade, unofficially. What he encounters on all sides in Berlin is stubborn resistance salted with suffocating paranoia. He also hears about the unlucky American student and insists he be part of the deal, which the CIA rejects. They're not interested. The acting is terrific, especially Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel. In smaller roles, the CIA agents and Soviet and East German negotiators are suitably opaque and blustering. Amy Ryan, Donovan's wife, is always excellent. They have the benefit of working from a strong script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen, and Joel Coen. I particularly liked how, whenever Donovan asks Abel if he is worried about some particular outcome, Abel responds, ""Would it help?"" The look of the film is exactly right—cold, forbidding—and the Glienicke Bridge, site of the hoped-for exchange is a desolate place. Spielberg's handling of Donovan as ""the standing man,"" underscoring a metaphor introduced by Abel, works. If only he'd resisted a few message-heavy Hollywood touches (East Germans versus U.S. children scrambling over a wall, for example), it would have been perfect.","

Considering the portrayed event and troubled time that happened, the film could have brought a higher tension, the lack is mostly felt around Tom Hanks' character, James B. Donovan, as he's doing something so outrageous in the Americans' perspective. The hostility is there,it's perceptible but it's not high as it might be. A aspect which could help fulfill this need is the soundtrack, which didn't show up as expected, instead was restrained and discreet. Tom Hanks is the highlight among the cast, he delivers a great performance. The character is fantastic, his power of rhetoric and persuasion are astonishing as a result his speeches are just jaw-dropping. Another good acting was Mark Rylance being Rudolf Abel. He transmits such serenity and wisdom due to his personality, and when he and Tom Hanks are in the same scene, you just sit back and enjoy their chemistry creating some impressive discussions.","

Donovan's insistence on being the best possible lawyer for the enemy nation's spy, makes him come under fire from the American government & press. Donovan somehow prevents Abel from being executed in the electric chair. This later comes in handy, when an American pilot named, Francis Gary Powers(Austin Stowell) gets captured in the Soviet Union. Now, it is up to James B. Donovan to facilitate a prisoner exchange & bring back Powers, safely to the US. Bridge of Spies is a spectacular film. Director Steven Spielberg, has made another masterpiece. This movie is even better than Spielberg's other biopics like, Lincoln(2012) & Schindler's List(1993). Lincoln(2012) is great, but it is slow. Schindler's List(1993) is a classic but, it is a bit slow as well. However, Spielberg has successfully pulled it off with this film. Bridge of Spies is primarily a drama but, it is extremely thrilling. You just don't know what's going to happen next, even in the final minutes of the film. I would have given this film a ten if it was say, 10 minutes shorter. Then, it would have been even more gripping. The suffering in Berlin during the time of the Berlin Wall, has been accurately depicted & is heartbreaking. Apart from Spielberg's brilliant direction, the performances are another highlight of the movie. Tom Hanks is outstanding as James B. Donovan. Hanks is charming, adds humor to the serious proceedings & can also be intense when the script needs him to be. Mark Rylance is amazing as Rudolf Abel. Amy Ryan is great as Mary Donovan. Stephen Kunken is good as William Tompkins. Austin Stowell is awesome as Francis Gary Powers. Will Rogers is impressive as Frederic Pryor. Mikhail Gorevoy & Sebastian Koch are superb as Ivan Schischkin & Wolfgang Vogel respectively. Jillian Lebling, Noah Schnapp & Eve Hewson are brilliant as Peggy Donovan, Roger Donovan & Carol Donovan respectively. The supporting characters are impressive too. Bridge of Spies is a must watch, for all Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks fans. Go for it!","

"Bridge of Spies","robert-temple-1","15 April 2016","This film is an example of myth-making, whether intentional or not I do not know. There is very little chance that the U-2 spy aircraft supposedly 'shot down' in 1960 by the Soviets in the notorious 'U-2 Incident' was really shot down at all. The various existing stories significantly contradict each other. The Russians say they fired one S-75 Dvina missile, but two different internet sites say that seven or thirteen missiles were fired, one shooting a MIG-19 out of the sky by mistake. I do not believe that any of these stories is true. We now know that Lee Harvey Oswald insisted the plane was never really shot down, and papers released in 2012 by the CIA show that they never believed either that their own man, the young pilot Francis Gary Powers, was really shot down. So why should the film suggest that he was and perpetuate a now discredited myth? It was apparently impossible for the Soviets' S-75 missile to hit a target flying at above 70,000 feet as the U-2 was. Nor did they have the guidance and control capacity to hit the plane even if a rocket existed which could get that high with any semblance of accuracy. The film shows the plane crashing nose-downward, which contradicts the official report that it crashed nose-upwards. But it appears that the truth is it never crashed, and merely landed normally, as part of a complex and mysterious political plot. It has been suggested that this was to derail détente, but that may not be the whole story. There are other ambiguities regarding Powers himself. There seems to be no certainty as to his birthplace. In the 1960s he was said to be from Pound, Virginia, but on Wikipedia it says Jenkins, Kentucky, or perhaps Burdine, Kentucky. All three places are near one another on the Kentucky-Virginia border, and I used to know the area well. In the old days, apart from Highway 23, there was nothing but dirt tracks. The region is one of the wildest and most remote in the entire Appalachians. I have spent many, many weeks there in the distant past. The area was populated almost entirely by genuine hillbillies, who lived in log cabins and still hunted with flintlock rifles. I know this because I met them as a child, entered their log cabins, and held their flintlocks. I was not allowed to fire one because the gunpowder was precious and they cast their own lead ball shot from an iron mould. But the boy who let me hold and aim his own precious flintlock, which had an immensely long barrel and had 'belonged to my great-great-great-grand-pappy', was from about 1800 or even earlier. Using it, the family got most of their wild meat. The boy told me, in words I shall never forget: 'I can shoot the head off a squirrel at a hundred yards with my flintlock.' It was from this wild area that Powers was supposed to have originated, as well as another well known and notorious CIA-linked figure. (The coincidence of two major spy figures coming from the same dot on the map is impossible.) I also knew as a child a genuine local man who told me the CIA and FBI both had a special connection with Pound, Virginia, and that he had been hired himself by the FBI to do messenger work across the South and to report regularly to Pound. When Powers died mysteriously in 1977, many people thought he had been murdered. So all of these matters are extremely murky, and we shall probably never know the real truth about any of it. As for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, I do not know what the film's agenda is for showing him as a quiet gentle, thoughtful, and artistic man, who is repeatedly described as 'honourable'. Why also is the entire American population shown in the film as foaming-at-the-mouth McCarthyites who want to lynch Abel and Donovan? Are Soviet spies being set up as the new heroes? What is going on with this film? The idea that the supposedly naive insurance lawyer Donovan would be taken to see Allen Dulles, who would tell him he could carry out his own private negotiations with the Soviets at the height of the Cold War involving a spy and a captured pilot, is totally and outrageously ludicrous. Donovan had been part of the legal team at Nuremberg and must have had intelligence affiliations already in the 1940s. Rudolf Abel (aka Willie Fisher) appears to have been a failure as a Soviet spy in America, and it defies belief that the Soviets would exchange a high-value captured American airman for him. The suspicion is that the American and Soviet security services cooperated secretly, with or without the knowledge of their own governments, to stage these phoney events. The film does not make clear that Abel had been in jail for four years before the swap for Powers, and was hence 'old news'. The film maintains that the East Germans resented and defied the Soviets, which is absurd, since East Germany was the most supine and devoted Soviet satellite state in the entire Warsaw Pact. If the Germans had behaved as shown in the film, they would have been summarily executed. Why are we expected to swallow all this nonsense? The direction of the film by Stephen Spielberg is superb, and the performances by Tom Hanks as the lawyer Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel are outstanding in every way. (Powers features only as a minor figure in the two parallel stories shown here, which only come together with the spy swap on the bridge in Berlin.) But how much better and more interesting the film would have been if it had been accurate, and had explored the many mysterious byways and unanswered enigmas and contradictions. Instead, it adds to the existing, enormous disinformation overload.","

"Bridge of Spies","phd_travel","30 October 2015","This meticulously made and filmed movie is fascinating and topical considering the state of relations with Russia today.Some crucial things that should have been shown are left out. This movie had too much focus on Tom Hank's character Jim Donovan and his negotiations. It's interesting including the details of his catching a cold and the state of Berlin after the War but it sacrificed the broader picture. I think they could have shown the impact of the incidents on the relationship between Heads of State Eisenhower and Kruschev. Next, the shooting down of Power's plane was exciting but the movie should have shown him getting caught on the ground and paraded around Russia on TV. Thirdly, I wasn't sure how Abel was spying apart from the coin paper and how he was caught. Not very clear. Also I don't know if the silly student really got held up because he was so whipped about a fraulein but I found it so irritating that the whole negotiations could have been ruined by a silly infatuation. Leave him in East Germany - he deserved it considering what was at stake.The movie really plays the unsung hero card making him scorned by the public and his ungrateful boss (as always Alan Alda plays a schmuck to perfection). Mark Rylance is effective as Abel. Austin Stowell makes a suitably stunned looking Powers.Bottom line worth watching as a timely warning not to get into another cold war but the movie could have been better.","

"Bridge of Spies","rooee","24 November 2015","Amidst the megahits of Q4 (is winter the new summer?) comes this quiet sleeper from Steven Spielberg. It's a chamber piece defined by soft words and silent gestures. Even the true story upon which it's based is a relatively unseen bit of history. Although it's such an interesting story, you wonder why.You've seen the big beats in the trailer. But this is a movie of details as tiny as the secret messages that unshakeable Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) receives on the sly. He's captured and fast-tracked through the American justice system. Insurance lawyer Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) represents him, but he's powerless against a guilty-by-default verdict.Then the Ruskies capture a US spy and an American student. As a US citizen ostensibly representing no one but his clients, Donovan is bunged off to a divided Berlin to negotiate a swap: one Russian for two Americans. The devil's in the detail – and, as Donovan discovers, there are so many damned details.Spielberg is cinema's top craftsman. We know this. But he does little here to draw attention to that consummate skill – and I mean that as a compliment. The ""quiet camera"" of Lincoln continues. And as a story it's as much a humanitarian one as Lincoln, although the script here (sharpened up by the Coen brothers, who are presumably to thank for the plentiful ironic humour) is less labyrinthine, less grandiose. More on-the-nose.So is Thomas Newman's music, sadly, which sounds like one imagines a Spielberg movie should be scored, all sugary clarinet softness. It jars with the austere Cold War mood and only really making sense in the final scenes, where a creeping schmaltz lurks. The Lives of Others this ain't.That's not to belittle the human emotion the film possesses, which is mostly convincing. Abel's ""standing man"" speech is a keeper. But beyond that, Bridge of Spies is a film of Big Themes: what nationality means; what professional duty means; and the arbitrariness of national borders. Donovan is genuinely baffled by the hypocrisy of his superiors, regarding Abel as merely a human being doing a job – the same job many US spies are asked to do.Rylance, subtle and dignified, is a shoe-in for a Supporting Actor gong. Hanks, meanwhile, makes it look effortless, somehow forging a relatable everyman out of an iron-nosed lawyer. These are actors at the top of their game.Intense, involving, and intelligent: if you're looking for something patient and quietly moving at the multiplex, look no further. It might look like minor Spielberg, but it's a major dramatic success.","

"Bridge of Spies","zephyrnewyork","20 February 2016","I saw Bridge Of Spies with friends last night. It's a Spielberg film, so outstanding cinematography is a given.The plot isn't 100% historically accurate (as are most, if not all ""based on a true story"" films), but it is still very good. Every American, every citizen of the former East Germany and West Germany, every citizen of Russia or any former republic of the Soviet Union, such as Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan, Estonia; every citizen of a former Warsaw Pact country such as Romania, Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, Albania; MUST SEE this movie, especially those who weren't old enough during the Cold War. Life in our countries was very different during the Cold War. Many people, young and old alike, didn't live long enough to see the end of the Cold War, or the demolition of the Berlin Wall, because they were killed. Many families were separated or forced to relocate during the Cold War. Some of us served in the armed forces then and are known as ""Cold Warriors"". Some of these people might've been your relatives or friends of your family.The film depicts a part of the life and the negotiations of an American attorney during the Cold War and how tense things used to be. I felt the tension as Tom Hanks' character did his assigned and delegated jobs in the film. I have a better appreciation of life today as compared to the Cold War because of this film.","

"Bridge of Spies","scottshak_111","19 October 2015","Steven Spielberg comes up with a biography of a guy caught up in the jaws of political torture as he endeavours to negotiate the rescuing of two people in a cold war struck world. However, the movie isn't limited to that. There are melodramatic bits strewn all across in the gravy of one helluva screenplay which is brilliantly topped by a stellar cast.Bridge of Spies is an exceptional movie that has been helmed slowly, delicately and powerfully. There was a war going on, a colder one: a constant mental war of superiority between the two superpowers on the globe. In a twisted world like that, Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy ends up becoming a victim to the US-Russia distress claws. To save his ass, a lawyer by profession, James B. Donovan, played marvellously by Tom Hanks, is hired with hopes of giving a fair trial yet a subdued one to cover up the hoopla. What ignites as an unfair trial gradually tangles him up further into an even bigger commotion wherein CIA approaches Donovan to make a barter of Abel for a fellow American spy pilot caught in Russia.Scaling back a bit further, the thing that might strike you as a pleasant surprise is its beginning. We witness an old guy painting himself with the aid of a mirror. His acts are quite mundane, natural and harmless. Spielberg spends enough time on the character for us to relate to him, a normal guy who loves to paint, who is calm and couldn't possibly mean trouble. On the contrary, we see a troupe of psyched CIA crowd bent on catching him. They bag him at an odd hour and bring chaos to his house, breaking all hell lose, without a search warrant. That's where Donovan comes in with his propositions. But unfortunately chaos swallows him up. It becomes James v/s America, as every guy starts hating him for fighting a case for the Russian spy.What was also great to watch was how people change their perspective. At one point it was manifested how the world leered at James when he was defending Abel, but then at a later stage when he saves two Americans, all that hatred ends up metamorphosing into sheer love. Mark Rylance is outstanding as Rudolf Abel. At times his expressionless face belies his indifference towards the political muck he ends up in. Even when he is aware of an imminent danger, serenity rarely leaves him. He carries his knack for painting and wears it even at direst moments. For example, he calmly answers, ""Would it help?"" when asked ""Are you not worried?"" One of the most brilliant scenes in the movie is when Abel compares Donovan to 'The Standing Man' in his story. The music grows suddenly and imparts extra gravity to the bit.It is always a delight to watch Tom Hanks act. His face carries the right kind of emotions. Always lost in thought, he makes Bridge of Spies a dramatic hoot. There are top-notch dramatic frames that Spielberg slides in for emphasis. Like the one where Donovan's son gets influenced by a war video, and fills up his tub with water for safety. It is a sad reflection of how war changes everything. Also, at one point Donovan had the misfortune of witnessing people being fired at whilst trying to sneak through the border. At a later stage, James sees children leaping over fences, which reminds him of the same troubled scene which then again throws him into the pits of gloom.What is a tad sad is how long the movie runs. The movie could have survived some cuts. There are frames that we could have lived without. However, it is comprehensible and justified to show crucial bits of the horror and mental torture Donovan had to go through in order to get the job done. When he returns home in the end, he dozes off at once owing to exhaustion whilst in the backdrop his family gets to know his greatness. Quite endearing to watch actually!A highly recommended movie.","

"Bridge of Spies","indiecinemamagazine","23 February 2017","The film ""Bridge of Spies"" set during the cold war is a collection of banalities including a predictable plot, mediocre acting and dull music. The screenplay could have been much more thrilling if the writers would have followed the main events in a more historically accurate way.The real life of James B. Donovan was much more exciting than the one depicted in the film. He was a lawyer at the Nuremberg trials and was already a well-known lawyer when he took the Rudolf Abel case. Donovan did not see Berlin wall escapees being shot; the shootings, which were the most similar to the ones depicted were those associated with the killing of Peter Fechter that happened the summer after the Powers/Abel exchange on the Glienicke Bridge.The real life stories of the spies of that period offer rich material for a writer, however the Coen brothers took the most uninteresting segment of the espionage story. The characters are bland and forgettable. This is an example of a politically correct propaganda film showing the good work of the intelligence services.The film ""Bridge of Spies"" is boring and disappointing – a naïve film made for a naïve audience.

"Bridge of Spies","lasttimeisaw","23 January 2016","Steven Spielberg's 27th feature film is a superiorly constructed retro-pigmented Cold War drama, inspired by the real-life happening of a prison exchange among USA, USSR and GDR in 1957, a fourth collaboration with Hanks, who plays our hero James B. Donovan, a New York lawyer, who is firstly appointed to defend a KGB spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance), and later, he is entrusted by CIA in negotiating the release of the American pilot Francis Gary Powers (Stowell), who is captured by Soviet Union during his spy mission, in exchange of Abel, which will be held in East Germany. Meanwhile an American graduate student Frederic Pryor (Rogers) has been arrested as a spy by GDR government, but in fact, he is innocent, out of his righteousness, James wants to change the 1-for-1 swapping to 2-1, insist both Powers and Pryor should be released, where CIA's only interest is Powers, so will everything turns out as James hopes?Spielberg sensibly enacts a more true-to-life depiction of the espionage activity in the movie's slick opening, from the Hollow Nickel Case, Abel is introduced as a phlegmatic and practised old- hand, who can steadily erase the evidence while FBI is rummaging his room, and Mark Rylance, a UK thespian, whose theatre achievement is overwhelmingly distinguished, proves that he can upstage Hanks without steeping into theatrics, his portrayal of Abel as a docile, reasonable and undaunted figure leaps out to be the takeaway of the entire movie, with his offhand epigram towards James' impromptu questions like ""are you afraid?"" or ""are you worried?"". ""Does it help?"" shows his much prepared devotion to his dangerous cause, which is also the reason why he is able to win over James' admiration.Hanks acts in his very comfort zone, being an overall good guy, like his previous effort in Paul Greengrass' CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013), his goody-goody persona, aka, a standing man, has become quite weary, this is where dwells my major beef about the film, the script (with Coen brothers on board) conveniently establishes James as a textbook example of safeguarding the basic human rights without mining into his own inner struggle, as if from the very first moment, he is set about to be the unyielding fighter, against all odds of being the public enemy No. 2 to defend a so-called traitor, even after his own house being attacked, there is no single doubt ever flicking over his complexion about whether he should proceed this taxing case. More excruciatingly, he is also the one who miraculously persuades the jingoistic judge Byers (Matthews) from making a death penalty verdict to Abel by foretelling a possible prisoner-exchange would benefit from keeping Abel alive, and single-handedly accomplishes the tough deal without any assistance (he cannot even stay in the Hilton hotel) in Berlin. Everything tastes like an in-your-face American government propaganda of individual patriotism and the tropes are rather banal and a bit disappointing from Spielberg and co., e.g. the intentional juxtapositions of two disparate treatments of captives between USA and USSR, and an overlong shot of the hand of the GDR lawyer Vogel (Koch) after being denied for a handshake after delivering Pryor.But then, fairly speaking, the film is a stunning accomplishment from the production team and a captivating political drama which reflects the highest quality of Hollywood filmmaking presently, nominated for 6 Oscars this year, apart from BEST PICTURE and BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY, the other four are well-grounded (BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR for Rylance, BEST ORIGINAL SCORE, SOUND MIX and PRODUCTION DESIGN), but one might highly suspect it will go home empty- handedly.","

"Bridge of Spies","SvetoslavGrigorov","17 January 2016","OK, Bridge Of Spies. Long (141 mins) and boring spy thriller with the usual performance from Tom Hanks (James Donovan) who's face throughout the middle of the movie looks like a carrot due to the the bad makeup and in the other half has the usual-suspect- grimace if he is having a poo because of too much effort trying to convince us with his tricks in a particular scene. The story is ...hm ""based on a true story"" which can't save it from superficiality. Mark Rylance who plays Rudolf Abel is much more interesting/convincing as an actor but also struggle in the adapted screenplay so whoever did it better not do it again.The Iron Curtain/Berlin Wall is very much Hollywood and you have seen it in many other movies so you are already prepared for it and will not surprise you.

"Bridge of Spies","dromasca","23 December 2015","So after sharks, dynos, extra-terrestrials, WWII, Holocaust, Olympics terrorism, future, Lincoln and handful of other themes, it's the turn of the Cold War to be processed, re-created and brought to screen in the vision of Steven Spielberg. 'Bridge of Spies' inspired by the historical character of James B. Donovan, defender of the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and then main negotiator in the spies exchange that set him free for the US pilot Gary Powers downed while in a mission over the USSR, is also the first movie in the political thriller genre directed by Spielberg.Had the script of this film been written by Ken Follett or the late Robert Ludlum, I would probably have accepted much easier the outcome. However, when brothers Coen are two of the three authors of the script I would have expected more than a smooth narrative structure and well written dialogs (in many moments). There is almost nothing of the sparks or daring insolence of many of the scripts in the films directed by the two. The story is roughly divided into two parts, and the tentative to synchronize the two threads (Abel's story and Powers' story) fail not only because they were separated in time by five years but also because it is only the first that has interesting material and consistency. The lawyer who does the right thing defending the rights of a criminal who presumably caused harm to his own country in time of what some perceived as war is too gross an analogy to the contemporary fight against terror viewed from a liberal point of view. The second part is more like the classical East Berlin spy stories, but here again the schematic description of East Berlin and of the Eastern German policemen and even officials lacks authenticity and complexity.We are left with enjoying two formidable performances by Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan and especially by Mark Rylance and Rudolf Abel. I am looking forward to the nominations for the Academy Awards and I hope that Rylance will get at least an Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. His act here is my favorite from all 2015 movies I have seen until now. On the other hand the political messages that this film tries to convey are much too obvious. Yes, they are important, but important messages are not well served when the style gets that close to propaganda. Actually the genre this film is closer than other is the Western. One lonely hero fights for justice against the whole world and wins against all odds. It's just that the century is the 20th and the hero is not using his gun, but is a lawyer. Problem is that the analogy does not work very well in this recent film of Spielberg.","

"Bridge of Spies","ctowyi","15 October 2015","The missus asked me what I wanna see this week and I replied: ""what else, the Spielberg-Hanks one"". This collaboration has always been a marriage made in film-heaven. Yes, I even adore The Terminal. But I don't know about this latest one. My wife dozed off a few times and the dude sitting next to me slept through most of it.The story is based on the true-life tale of James Donovan (Hanks); a lawyer who was pushed headfirst into the Cold War during the 1960s when he had to negotiate for the release of downed U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) after the airman was shot down over Russia.The title refers to the popular Cold War nickname for what's now the Glienicke Bridge connecting East and West Germany at the time the film is set. Its official name then was the Bridge of Unity, but it garnered its alternate moniker due to its notoriety as a prisoner exchange point for Western and Soviet powers.This Cold War story is certainly ripe for a rip-roaring cross-country yarn but Spielberg went for a sweet classical tone instead. There is a certain elegant sheen to the proceedings and the film poses deep ponderous questions like what makes us citizens of our countries. Hanks' nobility shines off like a light from a candle in a dark room as he takes up the job that nobody wants. The spycraft is captivating and absorbing, and when I say spycraft I don't mean Bourne or Bond. Dead drops are meticulous affairs. Gadgets are giant cameras installed on the bottom of light-weight aircrafts and hollow coins with a poisoned pin for instant death inflicted on oneself by oneself. It is all good and fine but the film couldn't engage me totally with its lack of severity and tension.For me, the film worked best when James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and Rudolf Abel (Michael Rylance) are sharing a scene together. Abel's face is impenetrable, yet it is filled with the weight of histories and subsumed patriotism. There is a scene in which he opens up to Donovan that is absolutely haunting. The moment the movie just focuses on Hanks it loses me. There is nothing wrong with Hanks. Hanks is just playing.... Hanks for the umpteenth time. You know which Hanks I am talking about... he is the cleverest man, the perfect man in the whole world. He bounces up from setbacks with a dusting off of his pants. You know he will save the day. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with that. But it didn't help the cause of the character when he is depicted as the noblest Saint of Earth and all others are evil, vile and dumb. Where are the cat and mouse games and the battle of wits between the Germans, Soviets and this lone American knight in a shiny armor? Nobody stood a chance against Hanks, and to really drum it into you Donovan's Messiah powers, every American looks to him like he is the enemy of the state and the scum of the earth. I don't appreciate being manipulated like this, especially by a movie.Still, this is a handsomely made film with some superbly crafted scenes that will remain in my memory for a long time, like the building of the Berlin Wall scene. Spielberg's typical musical cues are a little too in-my-face for my liking, forcing me to feel a certain way. The narrative circles and probes, but it didn't manage to percolate. Usually Spielberg's magic envelopes me and makes me a believer, just not in the case of Bridge of Spies. The film resonates and beats with the sweet energy of a full orchestra with Spielberg-Hanks as the maestro, but like Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool's new manager, sometimes I prefer Heavy Metal.","

"Bridge of Spies","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","12 December 2015","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning At the height of the Cold War, suspected Soviet informant Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is captured, and is due to stand trial. Idealistic lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) agrees to represent him, at a great personal cost to himself and his family. But as the situation escalates, and casualties start being taken on the Russian side, it builds to a dramatic settlement outside the courtroom that will test both sides.Hanks and Spielberg are almost like their own company, obviously an effective partnership that has produced a number of high quality, epic productions over the years. The first thought bound to run through your mind when you see the latest offering from them is: what can go wrong? And so, the third film in a row I've reviewed that's been about spies unravels before me. Artistically, it's everything you'd expect on the tin, two seasoned professionals doing their thing and delivering the goods. In the end, though, it's just a bit too under-whelming to be great.In a day and age of relentless, flashy, fast paced CGI spectacles, it is refreshing to see such an intelligent and intricate story up on the big screen, taking its time to unfold and present all the facts. The drama itself does need to be pretty compelling, though, and sadly Bridge of Spies doesn't always maintain the most exciting pace. Hanks himself is serviceable, but hardly gives the most stirring performance of his career. But then, the trailer promised a dramatization of a man who risks losing everything, whose endurance and sanity are pushed to the very limit, but the script just never really delivers this, just a slow, plodding trot to the end, so he hardly finds himself stretched.It's an undeniably well made, intelligent and generally involving affair, if you're willing to pay attention, it just could have done with a little more meat on the bones underneath. ***","

"Bridge of Spies","Seraphion","17 October 2015","1957. Rudolph Abel is being followed as he retrieves a ""dead drop"". Back on his place, FBI agents soon storm in and arrest him. Insurance lawyer James Donovan is a skilled negotiator. He gets tasked to defend Abel despite it's been long since he handled a crime case. He accepts anyways. His family questions him about defending an enemy spy, but he insists on his professional code, even advising Abel not to tell anything to the government. Meanwhile, an Air Force lieutenant Francis Gary Powers and a few colleagues get handpicked by the CIA. A CIA agent Hoffman approaches Jim about Abel but he divulges nothing. Jim argues about the legality of the search at Abel's place as there's no warrant; but he meets a dead end. Abel is found guilty of espionage, but the judge holds the sentence for another day. Visited in jail, Abel tells Jim that he looks like his father's friend who stood even after severe beatings. Jim visited the judge with his view of for Abel's sentence; that the judge shouldn't sentence Abel to die so he can be exchanged if suddenly a US spy gets captured in Russia. The judge decides to put Abel incarcerated, to public disagreement.Gary gets explained about the poison should he get shot down, which he eventually does over Russia. Jim gets a letter from Leipzig supposedly from Abel's family, so he brings it to him. Abel says it's a Russian way to contact him. In Russia, Gary's trial concludes The CIA summons Jim saying he's entrusted to negotiate an exchange of Abel for Gary. He has to act on his own, with no official government support. As Jim arrives in Berlin, complications take place as a US student Frederic Pryor is captured in East Berlin. Hoffman, now Jim's handler, tells him the Russians may switch Powers with Pryor. Jim goes to the Russian embassy in East Berlin supposedly to meet Abel's family lawyer, Mr. Vogel. Instead he meets Ivan Schischkin. He tries everything at Jim; sweet-talking to smoothly threatening; to get Abel and delay Gary's release. But Jim doesn't flinch; he even asks for both Gary and Pryor for Abel, though Schischkin insisted that Pryor is under East German authority. Next Jim meets Vogel who brings the East Germans voice, which demands the US parlays with them about Pryor, acknowledging them as a sovereign state. Hoffman tells Jim to sideline Pryor. Jim and Schischkin agree on the exchange place in Glienicke Bridge. Vogel backs down, saying Jim's selling the same thing to two parties. As Jim hitches a ride in his car, Vogel tricks him into spending a night in an East German jail. Hoffman accidentally tells Jim that the East German attorney general wants to meet him. But when they meet there's no agreement as Jim insists on his proposal; Abel for both Gary and Pryor. Hoffman gets angry with this, but as they wait eventually confirmation come from other side that Jim gets his way, although the East Germans want to exchange in Checkpoint Charlie. As they wait on the bridge, Jim keeps asking about Checkpoint Charlie. When the Russians arrive and both parties confirm identities, Jim asks to halt the exchange as he realizes the East Germans stall to see if the Americans go through while forgetting Pryor. At last the East Germans arrive and Pryor gets secured, so the Gary and Abel gets exchanged. Jim goes home and his family sees his name credited for Gary's release.The story contains great potential. A lawyer fervently defends his client despite obvious bias weighing the case, turning into a story of how a civilian managed to negotiate two-for-one prisoner exchange; this movie has its two major acts brimming with things to focus more on. Unfortunately, for me this movie feels like it lacks something. As a story about spies, the movie's first act looks more like a courtroom flick. It tries making it up on the second act, showing great visuals of Berlin on the early Wall era. But still the movie lacks much in suspense, a feat any real spy movie should have.The technicals in this movie work great wonders. The sets and props look very convincing. I very much enjoy the Berlin Wall train view as great never-been-done visuals. The scoring is also great as it supports in creating great mood for its scenes. The sequence when Pryor gets arrested is also great since as far as I know this movie is the first to show the Berlin Wall as it's being erected. The U2 shooting scene is also a great work as Gary's perspective view from his chute looks very beautiful.The movie did great in building up its mood and depicting the common anxiety in the Cold War era, particularly with the side scenes. Still, the lack of suspense really undermines the good things in this movie, particularly since this is a Steven Spielberg movie, who did great job in building the suspense in movies like Saving Private Ryan and Munich. The movie could also give more screen time for the second act to emphasize more on the spy aspect of the story, instead of balancing the courtroom drama and the Berlin negotiations.Acting-wise, the movie is a great work. As the main focus, Tom Hanks nicely measured his performance to be believable and yet still portraying Jim's persistence on his terms of the negotiation. Mark Rylance did well in balancing the performance as in one frame with Hanks. Austin Stowell and Scott Shepherd added nicely to the story angles. Sebastian Koch also did adequately to the story.My view for Bridge of Spies (2015) is it deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a so-so say from me since although it's a piece of great film work, still the movie lacks the suspense that the audience looks for in a spy movie.","

"Bridge of Spies","CinemaClown","24 December 2015","Marking the fourth collaboration between Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks, Bridge of Spies is an elegantly crafted, cleverly narrated & sincerely performed spy-thriller from the esteemed filmmaker who, even in what can be termed as his semi-retirement phase, continues to thrill & surprise us with stories that may not be as magical as his best works but still make up for an enriching experience.Inspired by true events, the story of Bridge of Spies is set in the 1960s during the Cold War and follows an insurance lawyer who is recruited to defend a Soviet spy, to give the illusion of a fair trial which in actuality turns out to be completely one-sided. But when an American spy plane pilot is caught by the Soviets, he's asked by the CIA to facilitate the exchange of spies between the two hostile nations.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Bridge of Spies continues his recent fascination with setting a drama around historical events and is another masterful work from the notable filmmaker that's thoroughly captivating from start to finish. While the story is dialogue-driven, the film has the structure of a cat-and-mouse game that keeps the interest alive and is wonderfully anchored by sensible performances from its cast.Production design team does a splendid job in recreating the timeline its story is set in with all the necessary details in place. Cinematography follows the mantra that other dramas by Spielberg carry and brilliantly reflects the grim period with its slightly darkened images. The pacing is steady and top-notch editing ensures that only relevant moments stay in the final print. Also, it's is one of those rare Spielberg flicks that's not scored by John Williams but Thomas Newman does well to fill up the void.Coming to the performances, Bridge of Spies features a much mature & dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Alan Alda & others, amongst which Hanks & Rylance impress the most. Hanks is at his usual best in the role of James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer assigned to defend the arrested Soviet spy in the court and later helps in negotiating a prisoner exchange deal between US & USSR. Rylance plays the Soviet spy with effortless ease and owns almost every scene he appears in.On an overall scale, Bridge of Spies is a refreshing entry in the genre of espionage thrillers that's deftly scripted and confidently brought to life under Spielberg's assured direction & Hanks' reliable performance. The plot brims with political tension, has its own set of twists n turns, and is consistently gripping despite its lack of action. The year of 2015 has already seen its fair share of spy-thrillers but Bridge of Spies is definitely amongst the best ones to surface and marks another successful collaboration between Spielberg & Hanks. Definitely recommended.","

"Bridge of Spies","virek213","19 October 2015","The forty-five year period between 1945 and 1990 is one that the whole world knew as the Cold War. During that time, there was a huge struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union for control of how much of the planet should be free or under the yoke of the atheistic system that was Communism; and at several points, that war almost went from cold to hot. In the main, it was primarily a war of intelligence gathering; and the possibility of spies being captured on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain was always a possibility. Such an event is the subject of director Steven Spielberg's 2015 Cold War suspense thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES, the 27th film in this legendary director's career.Tom Hanks, who has made it his business of playing an Everyman, portrays the role of James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer who, in 1957, was thrown into the breach of the Cold War by being forced to defend a KGB agent named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) on three counts related to espionage activity. Although Hanks loses that case in court, Rylance is spared the electric chair because, as Hanks admonishes those in high places, the day may very well come when the Soviet Union might capture one of our spies behind their lines, and that a prisoner exchange might well be necessary.Three years later, in 1960, that very possibility comes to the fore when Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a U-2 pilot working for the CIA, is captured by the Soviet Union after one of their missiles downs his aircraft. Hanks sees a huge opportunity for both countries (neither Rylance nor Stowell have divulged anything to their captors); but this potential boon is tainted by the capture of an American graduate student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) on the wrong side of the newly-completed Berlin Wall in the winter of 1961. Hanks then gets a hard lesson in the bizarre nature of Cold War politics, as Rogers is being held by East German officials, and both they and the Soviets are on different pages when it comes to the Communist political playbook.With the help of some fairly cagey maneuvering on his part, though it is severely looked down by his fellow Americans in general, and his own wife (Amy Ryan) in particular, as coddling an enemy agent, he manages to set up the moment of truth for all three men on the Glienicke Bridge (the actual bridge that is known as the Bridge Of Spies) that separates Berlin from Potsdam, all of this without any shots being fired in anger.Given that these events happened half a century in the past, and that an entire generation has grown up not knowing what the Cold War actually was, almost any other filmmaker might have had a very difficult time making the story clear. But then Spielberg has never been just any other filmmaker, and, being part of that generation that did know the fear that life as they knew it could end in a matter of hours, he knew that this was a story with huge implications, both political and humanistic. BRIDGE OF SPIES is a masterpiece of tension and suspense, with Spielberg continuing to show the influence of Alfred Hitchcock in his work; and Hanks basically does a role not dissimilar to James Stewart in several of Hitchcock's classic films. The depiction of the Cold War is magnified in the way Spielberg depicts the way the Berlin Wall cut off both the eastern and western parts of that city, and how Soviet soldiers cut down those who tried to jump over the wall (not unlike similar scenes involving the Nazi death camps in the director's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST. Rylance gives a superb low-key performance as Abel, a man resigned to his fate whatever it is but willing to accept what comes from it, gaining a lot of respect from Hanks in the process. Spielberg also superbly recreates that horribly tense period of the late 1950s and early 1960s where America was at risk, probably less from its fears of the bomb than its own anti-Soviet paranoia.Because John Williams, Spielberg's long-time collaborator, was unavailable due to health issues, Thomas Newman, part of Hollywood's illustrious film scoring dynasty, stepped in to do the score for BRIDGE OF SPIES; and while it may not have the typical verve of Williams, Newman's score has a lot to recommend it, including the influences of both Shostakovich and Copland, avoiding the easy and (in some ways) expected patriotic cues. Sober and serious much of the time, but with the added wit and gravitas of Hanks' and Rylance's performances to keep the story from getting too grim, BRIDGE OF SPIES is another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces for Spielberg, especially in his collaborations with Hanks; and it is a film that reminds us that the Cold War, though a part of history now, is also still an important part of that history.","

"Bridge of Spies","Hellmant","13 November 2015","'BRIDGE OF SPIES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Steven Spielberg's new Cold War drama film; about an American lawyer trying to arrange a prisoner swap, with the Soviet Union. The story is based on the 1960 U-2 incident; it was written by Matt Charman, and the Coen Brothers (marking the second film in a row, that was co-written but not directed by the brothers; following last year's 'UNBROKEN'). The movie stars Tom Hanks (in his 4th collaboration with Spielberg), and it costars Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Austin Stowell, Scott Shepherd, Jesse Plemons and Alan Alda. The film has received rave reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and it's considered a likely Oscar contender, at next year's Academy Awards. I really enjoyed it.The film begins in 1957 Brooklyn, New York; where Rudolf Abel (Rylance) is arrested by FBI agents, and charged with conspiracy. An insurance lawyer, named James B. Donovan (Hanks), is hired as his defense. Donovan takes the job very seriously, despite a corrupt court system, and hatred from a biased public. Abel is convicted of all charges, but Donovan is able to convince the judge (Dakin Matthews) to spare his life; on the chance that Abel might prove valuable, as a bargaining tool with the USSR in the future. His predictions come true, when an American U-2 spy plane pilot (Stowell) is captured by the Soviet Union.The movie is extremely predictable, even if you're not familiar with the history behind it, but it's still very well made. Hanks gives another outstanding performance; and Rylance is very impressive as well, in his supporting role. The film is beautifully shot, edited and scored; it's classic Steven Spielberg (doing what he does best). I was especially moved by the movie, and teared up on multiple occasions. It's a must see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/f4ptmnmXTWE","

"Bridge of Spies","pranayjalvi","26 December 2015","Collaboration of Tom hanks and great Director Steven Spielberg created a huge hype for this movie and me too was waiting for this movie. I spent 1.5$ for this movie at a cheap price of ticket and went to theatre to watch this. There was nothing wrong with this movie as everybody acted well and Spielberg as usual directed a well deserved Oscar winning Thriller film. However the plot was too slow and I was feeling sleepy while watching. The story involves only on one thing, exchange between countries which I felt too dumb. However critics liked it too much and predicts it for Oscar. I felt the movie very slow and boring and so I would go with 2.5/5 for this Spielberg directed flick.","

"Bridge of Spies","MLDinTN","18 January 2017","This is a movie about spies during the cold war. Main problem was the movie was well over 2 hours with not enough excitement or tension. Plot is Rudolf Abel is arrested for being a Russian spy, I guess he was but never really admits it. Tom Hanks plays James his lawyer. When an US pilot gets captured by the Russians, James makes a play to trade Rudolf for him. He does the dangerous work of even going to Berlin and meeting with Russian and German officials. He learns of a US student whom has been arrested in Berlin, so going against what he's told, he tries to bargain for the student also.So of course the 2 sides have issues, but in the end James is able to negotiate the release of both US detainees. FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but only watch it if you got a lot of time on your hands.","

"Bridge of Spies","Screen_Blitz","19 October 2015","Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks collaborate once again this espionage thriller set in the 1950s in the height of the Cold War, a period of political tensions between many nations across the globe and a time when the United States facing threats of communism from the Soviet Union that ravaged on until the early 1990s following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Based on the true events, Tom Hanks play James Donovan, an American lawyer who takes on a daunting court case to defend Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance), who is suspected of being a Russian spy, much to the outrage of the public as well as his wife and children. When CIA U-2 Spy-plane pilot Francis Scott Powers (played by Austin Stowell) is shot down and captured by the Soviets, Donovan is assigned into a negotiation with Germany to exchange Abel for Powers who is held hostage by German officers. This film marks Steven Spielberg's first collaboration with the Coen Brothers who produced this film, though the lack of humor typical for the directorial duo make it difficult to tell.This film does a pleasant job with highlighting the key points of the Cold War conflicts. It accurately portrays the atmosphere and the paranoia of nuclear war that America dealt with during this period. After all, it is Steven Spielberg behind the camera, and his director appears to carry polished knowledge on American history as demonstrated in some his previous outlets. One of the Cold War's most crucial elements of paranoia is best demonstrated in a scene for an example where Donovan's young daughter is in school and her class is watching an instructional video on seeking shelter for when a nuclear explosion occurs, and you see clips of cities getting wiped out by nuclear explosions. It genuinely shows the emotions people felt when the United States was in conflict against the Soviet Union, and how the threat of nuclear exchange was dangerously high. The Coen Brothers' screenplay and the direction are very well accomplished here, at least for the majority. Spielberg ambitiously maintains intriguing story as it follows the perilous journey of the main character and his attempt to make a deal with the Soviet Union, a deal that can carry catastrophic consequences if gone wrong. And with a crafty hand like Spielberg, he manages to keep the plot moving at a fairly solid pace, even when the film gets a bit too talky at certain points. Though the story doesn't quite offer many elements of surprise or even emotional depth (especially for a Spielberg flick), Spielberg fuels in plenty of substance to sustain the plot on an intriguing scale. The biggest disappointment in the narrative department however, may lie in the anti- climatic (though nicely shot by Janusz Kaminski) ending as the story concludes in a fading light fashion rather than with a bang, but there are some fair goodies in terms of the acting. Tom Hanks leads a terrific performance as his character James Donovan who is written beautifully without feeling very lionized with heroism. Mark Rylance does a pretty swell job as Rudolf Abel, the antagonist character who is portrayed very humanly without falling victim to contrived villainous characterization. Bridge of Spies is one of the best film of the year and is definitely a must see. While it certainly isn't as memorable as Steven Spielberg's other works, its still very satisfying. This is also probably the best film you will see centered on the Cold War.","

"Bridge of Spies","jmoneyjohal","16 October 2015","Every life matters, we see Tom Hanks character, James Donovan repeat this dialogue again, and again, and not till the tear dropping climax do we realize why he says this. Bridge of Spies is probably my personal favorite film of the year, The combo of Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have made another masterpiece, this being there fourth collaboration. Both create an absolutely moving,inspiring, and tear jerking film. Spielberg is just pure genius, he is like a gift from the film gods, and Hanks gives another Oscar worthy act. Spielberg with the Bridge of Spies, promotes American nationalism, and pride in a very worthy way, he doesn't spread propaganda that we see in films like American sniper. He shows, that all American lives matter, that a man who upholds the American constitution for ever person whether they be a spy or not is the real American hero. One who follows orders like a robot is not always correct aka CIA agents. Spielberg also shows how American children where feed false fear mongering information/propaganda to instill fear for a enemy who wasn't there, they just wanted to make American Nationalists. But more on that later. In short Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks get ready for the Oscars.Story wise the film is about an Insurance lawyer based in Brooklyn New York named James Donavan, who is given a criminal case after years to defend a soviet spy during the cold war between the US and the USSR. The case is a open and shut one, the American government is ready to hang the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, but James is not going to let that happen, he wants to defend his client properly by upholding the American constitution.Even though he is found guilty in all counts of the charges against him, James somehow negotiates with the Judge to give him life in jail, and not the death sentence. While the CIA follows James for info on Abel, he goes to Supreme Court to get a retrial, he fails but a opportunity comes out nowhere. The soviets have captured a American pilot, Gary Powers who was spying in Soviet skies for the CIA and they want exchange him for Abel. The CIA send James to negotiate the deal in Germany (no mans land), where a civil war in ensuing. What happens next is what forms the rest of the plot.Acting wise Tom Hanks is at it again with another masterful act, he makes the character his own, and leaves you in awe. The climax scene when he is watching Abel getting shoved in the back seat of a Soviet car, is pure genius and evokes tears. Mark Rylance is brilliant as the Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel. The rest of the cast are good in there respected roles.Bridge of the Spies is based on a true story, and Spielberg makes sure he tells the story as true as possible. He shows the good, bad and ugly side of America during the cold war, the film has no biases at all. He shows a man upholding the American constitution for an Soviet Spy, and he also shows how American children were feed false info to be made American Nationalistic robots. He showed how the CIA had there own agenda, and didn't necessarily care about American lives. The American stance against Germany during the Berlin Wall (East and West Germany)is also shown .In short Spielberg has got his facts almost 100% correct. And in a film like this that is of utmost importance. He doesn't take his audience for granted. He instead shows a powerful, moving drama, about one man trying to save American lives during the cold war. At many instance Bridge of Spies will leave you laughing,stunned, and in the climax you will be moved in tears. The films is an emotional journey of a true American hero James B. Donavan, who went from the most hated man in the USA, to an American hero. He is an American hero, and even I salute you good sir. This is the one of the most accurate, and positive films made on American history. The film is technically sound, its shot beautifully through America, and Germany in the 60s era, and the BGM is excellent. Kudos to the Cohen brothers for writing a brilliant screenplay and script. For me the film has no blemishes, but viewers may be for warned Bridge Of Spies is no flashy, no brainier entertainer, its a film made for a mature audience, who relish good cinema.Overall Bridge of Spies is nothing short of a masterpiece, Spielberg does it again and his resume and Oscars speak for themselves, but he proves his worth again, with this moving tale. In short if you want to see one of the years best films, don't wait,run to the theaters.4.5/5* or 9.3/10","

"Bridge of Spies","billygoat1071","19 October 2015","Bridge of Spies centers a lawyer who gets involved on defending a Soviet spy during the Cold War, meanwhile an American pilot was captured from the Soviet Union after a failed infiltration mission; having both sides even. This can be called a war movie, except it takes place in another side of the war; where we see people making decisions, having negotiations and such; might be recalling Spielberg's last film, Lincoln. Though some people may not be fond of the similarity, Bridge of Spies however manages to bring more humor and excitement within this journey. The plot remains rigorous, yet finds some real humanity, anyway. There are many reasons to get hooked into this film; from the story to the craft, whether it's big or small, the entirety is just excellent.The opening is already impressive, having a wordless prologue showing what this Soviet spy does in his job, hidden behind his innocent mannerism and appearance. It's simple, but tense and catches your attention, filling you with intriguing questions about this man's work. And then we cut to James Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is supposed to help this spy who was just captured and becomes a notorious man for defending an enemy of the nation. But things get tougher when he gets on an espionage, and then there's more. Despite the plot goes through a lot of directions, it never gets tedious and that might be because it's brought with some levity and sharp writing. But of course, the movie is on point with its theme. Basically acknowledging that no one is particularly good or bad in this war, both nations are having the same struggle, except Donovan strives to represent his country better by not only defending their spy, but also defending his own nation's integrity.And ironically, the Soviet spy happens to have more empathy in this film compared to the American spy. He can still be a threat for handling information, but he is actually a quiet old man who isn't afraid of anything. And his small moments with Donovan are instantly winning, mostly by its profoundness. In the midst of people arguing how to retrieve back their spies as safely as possible, the viewers shouldn't be worried by a stick-in-the-mud plotting, because the film hints with subtle humor. But of course, there is some suspense to be seen, as well. The opening is just the most interesting for its sense of mystery; the rest of the set pieces are just tension of people probably getting into trouble.And these scenes won't be as effective if it weren't for Steven Spielberg himself. The smaller scenes are obviously gripping and given warmth when they needed to, while the larger ones have brimming spectacle. The overall imagery always look great due to its stunning cinematography. The Coen Brothers, as the co-writers of this film, can obviously be noticed by the film's levity and some subtlety, as well. The acting is all predictable, with Tom Hanks being terribly engaging as James Donovan, but the more notable actor, Mark Rylance, brings a less showy performance, yet given something more to his moments.Bridge of Spies is stellar, simply by its craft and how it straightforwardly retells this story. It doesn't necessarily try to heighten the stakes beyond than what's necessary, in which some viewers can be disappointed, but the movie offers something more earnest and riveting. There is still a fine dose of suspense, though it actually handles a variety of tones: there are moments of coldness, but there are also moments that lighten itself up; making each account quite affecting and most importantly, entertaining, in this case of these men finding better justice for saving each other's spies, during one of the toughest times in history. And it's all done much you would expect from these filmmaking and acting talents.","

"Bridge of Spies","donegalcat","24 March 2018","A well-made and acted but understated cold-war drama about the exchange of prisoners between the USA and the USSR in Germany.Tom Hanks is reliably good as the insurance lawyer James Donovan, drawn into cold-war intrigue, representing a Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in court. Mark Rylance gives a quiet, understated performance as the spy. Rylance is competent, but the performance is rather a surprising nod for an Oscar.After an American spy pilot is shot down over Soviet air space, much of the film is set in Berlin as Donovan negotiates with Soviet and East German authorities for the release of the pilot and an American student captured in East Berlin in exchange for Abel.The scene where the pilots plane is shot down, is poorly filmed with cheap special effects. But otherwise the film is well shot with excellent period detail and atmosphere. Although some of the scenes in East Berlin verge slightly on absurd, a hint of the Coen brothers influence as screenwriters for the film.Amy Ryan is largely wasted as Donovan's wife while the early scenes detailing Abels court case feel a bit short and underdeveloped. And the final scenes fall prey to Steven Spielberg's usual twee sensibilities. But overall, the film represents a decent notch in the well worn and capable partnership between Spielberg and Hanks.","

"Bridge of Spies","jtindahouse","11 February 2016","It's so nice to watch a director who's completely in charge of whatever it is he's making. Even if the end product isn't perfect or to your liking, you can still appreciate that you are watching a master of his craft at work. Steven Spielberg will always be one of those directors. It helps he always works with an incredible team and has amazing actors at his disposal to direct, but the fact remains his name alone is always a stamp of quality. 'Bridge of Spies' isn't perfect, I have very little interest in the Cold War, the story itself within the war did very little for me, and yet it was an absolute pleasure to watch. A sure sign of class. The film has been nominated for Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. I think the nomination surprised some as it wasn't Spielberg's finest work, and it was missing some of the ""neccessaties"" when it comes to getting a nod, like a compelling love story (you could say there was one but you'd be stretched to do so). Films that are considered lucky to get a nomination are never any shot of actually winning the award, as they are just supposed to consider themselves lucky to be there in the first place. So sadly you won't be seeing 'Bridge of Spies' take home the award. A well deserved nomination nonetheless.Also nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role is Mark Rylance. Rylance blew me away. He has an amazing ability to appear as though he's not trying in the least bit, and yet at the same time completely steal a scene - even from the likes of Tom Hanks. The Coen Brothers, along with Matt Charman, wrote some terrific and Oscar worthy dialogue for him to deliver admittedly, but it was no doubt him that brought those words to life. Everyone is going to have a tough time knocking Sylvester Stallone off his perch for the award this year but if anyone can do it I believe it's Rylance.The only thing really holding it back from being great is that it's a touch dry. I never felt any emotion towards any character throughout the entire film. That, along with the fact that there is very little humour anywhere in the mix, can make it a tough watch at times. The quality though makes it worth the price of admission. Nothing is done half-heartedly, the sets are astonishing, even set on the actual bridge the events happened on. Hanks is his usual charismatic self and Rylance is in masterful form in every scene he's in. It's probably not one Spielberg will be most remembered for when we look back in 50 years, but I'm certain he'll still be proud to have it on his résumé.","

"Bridge of Spies","Benjamin-M-Weilert","19 May 2019","While at first I was skeptical for this film's Best Picture nominee status, as I was under the impression it was just given to it because it was directed by Speilberg and written by the Coen brothers, it did eventually win me over by the end. Of course, first it had to get through a Cold War version of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" before that, but once Tom Hanks' character got to Europe, things got interesting. Clearly, the direction and writing on this film is what gave it the nomination it deserved.","

"Bridge of Spies","Dr_Coulardeau","31 March 2016","We all remember, from our history text books at least, the events from 1957 to 1962, the total hysteria of the USA about Soviet spies which had led to McCarthyism and the execution of the Rosenberg husband and wife. The fall of Cuba out of their zone or sphere of influence was a trauma they are just right now trying to put behind. The spying was primitive with those spying planes that had no chance what-so-ever to get through: the first one was the last one. On both sides they ended up with spies in their prisons kept nicely warm to be used in some political negotiations as leverage. Consider the case of a Soviet spy in New York and that of an American pilot of a spying plane shot down over the USSR, plus the fact that East Germany turned tricky and led to the construction of the wall, and to top it all like the cherry of the cake one naïve American student preparing his PhD on communist economic policy in eastern Europe was at the wrong place at the wrong moment and got arrested and prosecuted as a spy by the East Germans. But the East Germans hated the Russians who had for sure liberated them from Hitler, but who had also destroyed Berlin in the most ruthless way possible, though the Palace of the Hohenzollern was pulled down by the East Germans. Tricky situation indeed to negotiate the release of two Americans, one of whom is a real security risk in exchange of one Soviet spy. And it took some time and a lot of patience, including against the CIA who only wanted to recuperate the security hazard out of Soviet hands before he cracked. It took a lawyer from Brooklyn, a pure Irish descendant to manage to bridge the two or three divides to get what he wanted. All those among you who have actually lived this period will remember the stress, the danger, the fear amplified by what the film does not tell: the Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961 and the Soviet missile crisis in Cuba in 1962. We went through a few years of absolute scare about the possibility of a nuclear war.We can measure the immense change we have been through: reunited Germany; united Europe (nearly finished though Russia will always be on the side); free and emerging Vietnam; China the second economic power in the world; apartheid gone with the wind; Cuba accepted anew by the USA; the banana republics of South America also gone. And yet the dangerous places have just moved to other areas and mostly because of the dumb policy of one US president who decided to solve the problem he had with his own father by proving to the world the USA could create havoc in the Middle East, and they did. And North Korea is the answer of the shepherdess to the shepherd: a perverted and fouled love song that prolongs the Korean War that was a total failure in the objective of the time to get Mao Zedong and the Communists in China down. Is the world really a better place today than it was in 1957-1962? You have to be naïve to believe that. The main difference is that spying is no longer that crucial and it has been replaced by the protection of intellectual property against pirating. Pirates and Hackers are the two plagues or our modern world. More than ever the danger is no longer from the outside but from the inside. Let's move our minds and backsides a little bit and let's clean up the mess Bush Jr. did and all European countries, especially the super-duper secular ones who pretend that everyone has the right to be a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian, or whatever, provided it is kept absolutely invisible in the public sphere, are today confronted to the bill.Dematerialization and castration of at least two generations of immigrants in Europe from previously colonized countries, which means at least three, four or more centuries of colonial alienation, exploitation and extermination when necessary leading to uprooting them from their countries and transporting them into countries that refused to recognize and respect the fact that they are different. As the fundamentalist secularists would say: ""They can believe in what they want provided I do not see it."" And the hazardous population is not outside but inside our borders. We have walled them up in our backyard without any rights whatsoever as for opinions and religions.The old Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome we all in Europe inherited from centuries of wars and the two world wars was turned into a Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome called the Cold War and we are still in that mood. We see the danger outside when it is inside, and not inside our territory only but inside our minds. The new situation is that the PTSS of the Cold War is confronted today to the Post Traumatic Colonial Stress Syndrome of the uprooted millions of previously colonized people who we have brought in our countries for salaried slavery. And we think that by mocking the religion of these human beings who are suffering in their inner essence we will free them of their PTSS. Only Charlie can be that dumb. I am sure that kind of anti-empathetic attitude would have turned the 1957-1962 situation into a holocaust. And that's the real danger today. The Islamic State will be defeated but what do we do afterwards? Cartoons of the Prophet dicing onions? And I am trying hard to remain polite. I guess some secular fundamentalists do think so. Papaoutai? Really this time. https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=oiKj0Z_Xnjc. Stromae help us out of this diabolical fix!Dr Jacques COULARDEAU","

"Bridge of Spies","sujanfaster","28 November 2015","There are two sides two Steven Spielberg. One- Making magnanimous movies with big budget and special effects, Two- Making history come to life with classic film-making. Bridge of spies belongs to the second type. Based on true events, Bridge of Spies tells the story of American Lawyer, Jim Donovan in two parts. The first part is where he tries to do his best as a defense lawyer for the alleged Russian spy Abel and the second part where he negotiates a prisoner exchange with Russians and Germans. The film has two different flows. But, one cannot argue over the shift in the storyline as it is based on real events and it is best that Steven Spielberg has kept it that way. Very well written dialogues, subtle humour and great acting makes this movie, a masterpiece. Not too emotional, not too funny, not too dramatic this movie balances everything well.Tom Hanks, well there is nothing to say about him we all know he gives the best. But Rylance, with very few lines is the one who steals the show in this film. His role adds a whole new dimension to a grey character. Apart from these two characters, other roles are hardly significant. If you are looking for an out and out entertainment, this movies pace might disappoint you. But this movie is for the good cinema lovers. Who loves and admires a work of art whenever they see one.","

"Bridge of Spies","DanielRobertRoss","16 October 2015","I've been a huge fan of Spielberg for ages. Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, Minority Report etc. But the last few films haven't really done much for me. Crystal Skull really killed my enthusiasm for his films, and with the exception of Tintin, I haven't seen anything since that matches his best. But Bridge of Spies is a true return to form. Unlike Lincoln, which I thought was dull Oscar bait, Spies is a taut, exciting cold war thriller. John Williams provides another great score, the cinematography is excellent, and the film really captures the cold war paranoia and fear of those turbulent times. Parallels can be made between this film and the Bush administration, and at the same time not get bogged down in politics (Unlike the dry Amistad). This is a film that reminds people that the most exciting words on a movie poster are ""A Film by Steven Spielberg"".","

"Bridge of Spies","agmoldham","22 December 2015","I have to confess to knowing very little about Bridge of Spies before the opening credits rolled. Going from the title and Tom Hanks presence was expecting a thriller, but it's actually a docu drama. The film tells the tale of events from the cold war. Like most docu dramas it suffers from the need to spice up a few of the real life events, but judging from other comments on the web most of the main plot lines are true.Hanks plays James B Donovan who is a lawyer hired to defend a Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). The film is always at it's best with the interplay between Donovan and Abel. A few of the scenes could probably have been dealt with a little more harshly in editing. As ever Hanks is always very watchable though, so it's certainly well worth a watch and gives a sense of what life was like during the cold war.","

"Bridge of Spies","jrarichards","17 October 2016","If the basis of a good film is a good story, then it shouldn't be too difficult to make a success out of the real-life (1962) exchange of (British-born) Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for American spy-plane pilot Francis Gary Powers and American student Frederic Pryor, all the more so given the background of the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the events leading to Abel's capture in a ""Reds Under the Bed""-obsessed 1957 America.But ""Bridge of Spies"" does not make it very clear that its real-life events cover a 5-year period, and maybe that is as it should be. This is a film, when all is said and done, and it is as a film that it should or must be judged. Who knows if Rudolf Abel was as likable as Mark Rylance makes him out to be? Intuitively that would seem pretty unlikely. And indeed perhaps even Tom Hanks's lawyer for Abel's defence - James B. Donovan - was not quite the ideally noble character we see.It matters not in the work of art that is this film.The ever-so-slightly Nixon-like Hanks looks like he's been extracted physically from 1957, and indeed immaculate authenticity of US setting is a hallmark of the film. And - having been born in Poland in 1959 - Janusz Kaminski on camera needs no lessons in how to make the Eastern European scenes look as they should. Thomas Newman's score adds greatly to the effect, and there are enough 2015 nuances in plot-lines and script to hint to us (I think rightly) that the division of the then world into US angels and Soviet devils was almost but not quite that.Indeed, a joy of the film (if not for the first time in cinema history) is the way it depicts (again one assumes realistically) the way in which East and West did have to find some ways at least of ""getting on"", even if only for pragmatic reasons, and - let's face it - to ensure that the bombs were not actually dropped, in spite of all the rhetoric. They were not, so somehow it worked...While supporting cast members like Alan Alda, Scott Shepherd, Sebastian Koch, Peter McRobbie (in an excellent cameo as Allen Dulles) and especially Mikhail Gorevoy (as the KGB man) all do great things in parts that paint in that authentic background, this is ultimately the film of the Rylance-Hanks pairing, and this is inspiring and interesting, and offers the chance for a surprising amount of wit and wisdom, and indeed warmth.Indeed, this film has a particular cosy feel about it, which scarcely seems warranted - given the circumstances - but is quite tangible and imparts huge watchability to the movie. Not for a moment do things drag.Ultimately, that enigmatic ""cosiness"" presumably boils down to the fact that the Donovan we follow is left much to his own devices as he moves from East to West and back again, is regularly in danger (indeed even in his own home in America), is playing a potentially risky game of high stakes with very big fish indeed, but manages to do so successfully by simply doing his (lawyer's) job as best he can in a circumstance in which his ""best"" is pretty darned good. He somehow keeps himself out of danger, and although he is sharp and even at times wily, he is most of all just dogged; and he keeps (or chooses to keep) things clean, simple and straight when all those around him seek to make them dirty, devious and complicated. Given that the key concept in the whole film (put into words by Abel) is that here is a man who always stands up again no matter how many times, and no matter how hard, he is knocked down, that cohesively whole image is indeed conveyed by the film, and it comes over as remarkably refreshing, and surprisingly convincing.Those interested in the truth behind the story are encouraged to read about it at length, but that should definitely be done after the film has been seen and judged (and enjoyed) on its own merits, which are as a very impressive and enjoyable piece of art.","

I have to finally give a thumbs up to Spielberg for making a family friendly film (with the exception of some curse words which can be bleeped out).This is a must see movie! It's gripping and wonderful. I love how Spielberg portrays the Cold War era without making it to risky for those who still remember it. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job in the lead role. This is definitely one of his better roles and one that he will be remembered for. This is an exciting year for family friendly films from Bridge of Spies, Inside Out, War Room, Woodlawn and so forth.This is definitely worth your time. It's a beautiful film, true to history and not to risky.","

"Bridge of Spies","nmholland","27 February 2016","Bridge of Spies is directed Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks as James Donovan, an American lawyer that, in Cold War era 1957, is chosen to defend a captured Soviet spy named Rudolf Adel (Mark Rylance) in a court of law. He later is selected to negotiate a swap of sorts to trade Mr. Adel to the Soviets in exchange for an imprisoned American pilot, Francis Powers (Austin Stowell). This film is based off of a true story, and is truly one of the best films of 2015. I'm glad it's nominated for best picture.The best thing this movie offers is the directing. Very few films are directed perfectly, and this is absolutely one of them. The camera angles Spielberg utilizes are fantastic, and his ability to capture a whole conversation in just one shot is magnificent. The cinematography is also great. The cinematographer (Janusz Kamiński) did amazing at capturing the Cold War era, and the flips in between Germany and the United States are very distinguishable and impressive.On the contrary, the movie is long, and has about 2% rewatchability. Much like Spielberg's 1993 film, Schindler's List, the movie is a one or two time watch, and may be a two hour-thirty minute snooze-fest for action lovers. Anybody who comes to this movie expecting James Bond espionage will surely have a good nap. However, a film lover and admirer of the art of cinema will be on the edge of his seat.The acting is also great. Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance, as always, yet not very memorable, unlike Forrest Gump or Captain Miller (Saving Private Ryan). His character won't be remembered in twenty years or so, no matter the status that the film ascertains. However, Mark Rylance gives the performance of his career. Besides Stallone, Rylance is most qualified to acquire the Oscar. The only performance I really had a problem with was that of Amy Ryan in the role of Mary Donovan (James' wife). She didn't exactly do bad, but her ability to portray her disagreement with her husband in dealing with his defense of a Soviet spy.The main problem I had with this movie is everything having to do with the American spy, throughout the first 45 minutes or so of the film. It takes away from the intensity going on with Hanks' and Rylance's characters. Every time something suspenseful was happening, the film would switch over to Power's side of the story, which wasn't too interesting. His scenes were directed well, and acted well, so the blame goes to the jumpy script, although the Coen brothers (yeah, they wrote a serious movie) ultimately did well once the second act rolled around, and lifted the film up pretty high.The last thing I'll mention is the score. This is the first Spielberg movie in many years that is not composed by John Williams, and it shows. However, that's not a bad thing. This film has a really good score, and keeps the suspense up, in a style Williams doesn't often use. Not to criticize Williams; he's the best film composer working today, but the score is captured beautifully by Thomas Newman, this film adding to his collection of many other great films he's scored, such as The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and American Beauty (1999).Overall, Bridge of Spies is a great movie with a few nitpicky problems here and there. The acting is good, the script is good, and the directing is flawless. I'm going to give Bridge of Spies an A-, or a 9 out of 10.","

"Bridge of Spies","Alanjackd","30 November 2015","I recall a time when SS would push the boundaries of film making. That was then.Whilst being a very good and well scripted affair it's not what you might call a thriller...no particular tension to speak of as even without a history lesson you know the outcome .All cast do a brilliant job and direction and production is top notch...I don't think I have ever seen a movie with more of a cold war feel about it...especially set direction..one would think it was filmed via a time capsule.Lot of talk of American propaganda but that's a lot of rubbish..everybody was scared at the time and were cautious.Just a word about tom Hanks...he seems to have found a director who knows how to get the best out of him...never rated him much till SS got him to act his soul out in "" Saving Private Ryan"".Mark Rylance runs the whole show with his beyond excellent portrayal of a paper soldier in a non contact war of mis-guided hatred and was a pleasure to watch.Not since Micheal Keaton in ""Birdman"" have I enjoyed such a performance.The only down is the direction was very safe and never gave the audience any real feel of threat or tension.All in all not a SS classic but well above average.","

"Bridge of Spies","griffolyon12","19 October 2015","Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have teamed up for the fourth time in their illustrious careers to make their latest film, Bridge of Spies. Few filmmakers could literally direct in their sleep, and Spielberg probably could do that, the same with Tom Hanks in regards to acting, thankfully both of them give it their all here and make Bridge of Spies a very polished film that, while is neither of their best work, is still well worth your time.Bridge of Spies tells the story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), a Brooklyn-based insurance lawyer in the late-1950s who took on the case of accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (a likable Mark Rylance). Donovan was seen as a pariah for doing his best to defend Abel to the letter of the law, but he was then recognized as a hero when U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), was shot down over Soviet Russia, and Donovan was tasked by the CIA to travel to East Berlin to negotiate a swap - Abel for Powers.Spielberg works from a script that was written by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, and the Coen influence is very evident throughout the script. There are scenes of high tension one second (all exquisitely milked by Spielberg), and then moments that disarm the tension with humor the very next (a place where Tom Hanks excels at), which is very reminiscent of Coen films like Blood Simple or No Country for Old Men. This five-way collaboration between Spielberg, Hanks, Charman, and the Coens, finds each of these exceptional filmmakers all pooling their collective talents together to make a film that plays to all of their strengths, and that is the main reason that Bridge of Spies is a cut above most films in current release. The fact that the movie may have too high expectations upon it, purely because of the prior resumes of all involved, does not detract from the fact that this is still a remarkable film that captures a moment in history where too few films have gone.The history of film is full of movies about World War II, but when it comes to the Cold War, it's been an area that has been vastly unexplored by Hollywood. This film accurately recreates the period when Cold War paranoia was at its height in the States, making this a fantastic history lesson as well as fantastic entertainment. The production is designed with exquisite detail, with Berlin in particular looking as if it leapt off the pages of history books, and it really reinforces how bad things really were during that period. In just the background characters alone, Spielberg could have probably made three or four other movies, all of which would be equally as fascinating, that is how insane this moment in history was, and it's why it should never be forgotten. On the technical side of things, Bridge of Spies is another Spielberg, Janusz Kaminski collaboration with stunning cinematography. The film uses muted colors, with lots of grays, blacks, and navy blues on display in the sets and costumes, while the cinematographer, Kaminski, utilizes a lot of wide angle lenses to mimic the looks of many Hollywood films from the Fifties. This film simply looks as slick and stylish as anything that Spielberg has ever made, and yet it very affectionately feels like a throwback to the movies of the era in which is this film is set. The feel of movies like Judgment at Nuremberg is very evident in many moments. Of course, while the movie is a technical marvel and a well recreated history lesson, what makes Bridge of Spies stick with you after seeing it is the character of Donovan himself.James B. Donovan was a very fascinating man. He defended Abel because he believed that if we just sentenced him to death for being a spy without any due process, how does that make us any different from our enemy? If we see ourselves as Americans as being the better men, then should we not show the world that we are? This kind of straight arrow character is a rarity in film nowadays, with Hanks really mirroring the likes of Jimmy Stewart and Gregory Peck in his performance, it's just that kind of role and he does it perfectly. Then there is Rylance as Abel, who plays him in a very quiet, controlled manner that really paints Abel in a poetic light. He was simply a patriot, who believed in his country and on top of that, was just an unassuming, nice man who actually befriends Donovan in an interesting way. It really goes to show that the bogeyman is not always the monster we make him out to be, and I think that was one of the main ideas Spielberg was wanting show with this film, and I believe he does so brilliantly.I give Bridge of Spies a 9 out of 10!","

"Bridge of Spies","GManfred","28 October 2015","Just weighing in but with nothing new to add. I agree with other reviewers, it's a very entertaining film that's hard not to like. sometimes I am struck by that fact that Spielberg films often resemble Frank Capra films in that they uphold a high standard in filmmaking and don't always rely on naked characters and buckets of blood. In ""Bridge of Spies"", Tom Hanks has the Everyman role Capra used to employ. This one, in fact, is rated PG-13, which doesn't happen often in Lowest-Common-Denominator Hollywood.Tom Hanks never disappoints and an argument could be made that he is America's best actor. Here he is his old self, although a few pounds heavier than in previous pictures but an idealist in the James Stewart mold. Good supporting cast of unfamiliar faces and the story moves along at a good clip. It's all been said and I don't do summaries - read another reviewer for one. Very worth seeing, an oasis in a desert of crummy Hollywood movies.","

"Bridge of Spies","keithlovesmovies","22 November 2015","During the Cold War, U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is captured by the Soviet Union after his U-2 spy plane gets shot down. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, Powers' only hope is New York lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is recruited by the CIA to negotiate his release. Donovan then boards a plane to Berlin to try to secure Powers' freedom through a prisoner exchange. If all went according to plan, the Soviets would get Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), the convicted spy who Donovan defended earlier in court.I will say that the film is not as exciting as the trailer but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. There isn't too much action or suspense as the core of this film is based on conversations between characters. The suspense comes from whether or not the people on the other side will follow through with what they say and whether or not the situation in which the characters are in the middle of, The Cold War, will have an impact on the proceedings. But what had the potential to be quite dull was not thanks to the performances of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, the direction by Steven Spielberg, the score, and the cinematography that really captured the paranoia in that corner of the world during the Cold War. Hanks is great here as he was the only reason I saw this film. In his best role since Captain Phillips (I still think he should have been nominated for an Oscar for that one instead of Christian Bale for American Hustle). I liked him in this one because I found his character to be very endearing and very human. I also found that this went well when juxtaposed against the world he was in. Rylance, who I have never heard of before this, stole scenes as the Soviet spy Abel. He was very witty with a calm demeanour and who never let the situation get to him. He and Hanks had great chemistry which made their scenes together very entertaining. I just wish they could have had more scenes together as their storyline was only for the first quarter when Donovan defended Abel in court and a little near the end of the film during the exchange. The reason I say this is because the middle of the film was not as exciting to me since it dealt with Hanks being in Berlin during the Cold War and having his character negotiating for the release of Powers and also another prisoner Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers). These scenes were still good because of the great script by the Coen brothers and the acting by Hanks and others. They just just didn't have the same weight for me since the film chose to focus on Hanks's character Donovan instead of the characters he was trying to rescue so they came off as one- dimensional. I guess they just wanted Powers for what he knew but they still could have fleshed him out more than just in the one scene. Also it is evident that this is taking place during the Cold War but I wished I had more of a sense of that. In other words, they could have gone further with that idea as we never got to see ""how bad"" the Soviets and the Germans, who captured Pryor, were as nothing really happened to them (onscreen at least). Overall, this is just a great movie and one of Spielberg's best.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com","

But he shows no fear in what he is about to face. Still Tom Hanks who plays the noble and upstanding James Donovan the case falls into his lap. Despite the ridicule he is facing and possible loss of his job and even family.Still he will not take no for an answer despite being ""forced"" into it and doing the right thing over defending Abel, who says people like him deserve a proper defense.But the proper jury and trial the USA does not want in the height of the Cold War. But when a pilot named from the USA, Francis Gary Powers played by Austin Stowell is captured by enemy lines as the USA and the U.S.S.R are enemies during this war. He is also not given a fair trial the same way. So Donovan must work to release Powers and a college graduate student named Pryor, played by Will Rogers and trade in Abel to the U.S.S.R.It will be no cakewalk as he faces very adversary government people from the East Germany where they were building the Berlin War at the time and the U.S.S.R.

"Bridge of Spies","Philipp_Flersheim","30 May 2022","Tom Hanks plays James B. Donovan, a lawyer whom his superior asks to take on the defence of captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). To the surprise of everybody, Donovan does not just try to keep up the facade of due legal process but really attempts to get Abel off. Eventually he persuades the court that Abel is valuable currency, given that the Soviets may at some point capture an American spy who will have to be exchanged. Once this happens, the US government approaches Donovan to negotiate the exchange, which takes place in Berlin. 'Bridge of Spies' is a great Spielberg that in some ways is typical of the approach of this director to historical material: At the centre of the plot is an everday person - Donovan - who decides to do more than what is expected of him (first during Abel's trial, and then when he negotiates the exchange), and that America has people like him is one thing which makes it a great country. The care that has been taken with costumes and sets needs to be stressed. Literally everything is spot-on, from the way US and Soviet prisons differ over the S-Bahn carriages and the scenes showing how the Berlin wall is being built to the films that cinemas in Berlin are showing in the winter 1961-62 (for example 'One, Two, Three' - which back then flopped in Berlin - and 'Spartacus'). The acting is superb throughout, and 'Bridge of Spies' is beautifully filmed: Spielberg paid a lot of attention to the colour schemes that characterise scenes in the US and in East and West Berlin, with the US being far more colourful that dark blue-grey Germany. All in all this is an outstanding example of modern film-making - a world away from the propagandistic myth-making of for example 'Darkest Hour' (2017).","

"Bridge of Spies","jboothmillard","21 January 2016","I saw this film reviewed on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, then award nominations were announced and this film got a good amount of them, I wasn't sure originally whether I'd want to see it or not, but I cannot ignore the films that get this buzz, from BAFTA nominated director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). Based on a true story, set in 1957, during the Cold War, lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who specialises in insurance settlements, is recruited by his firm to defend accused Soviet Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Mark Rylance, star of Wolf Hall). Donovan has never practised criminal law, after World War II he was formerly a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials, so the prosecuting attorneys, the judge, his firm and his family do not expect him to mount a strong case for Abel, Donovan becomes a hate target by many who just want Abel executed. Abel is found guilty of all charges and convicted, but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to 30 years imprisonment rather than execution, as he could be valuable to the USSR as a bargaining chip for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody, Donovan also appeals against the U. S. Supreme Court, presenting evidence that a search warrant was not issued during the arrest of Abel. This scenario does come into play, American pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) flies a U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union, he is shot down, captured, convicted and interrogated, then American economics graduate student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) visits his German girlfriend in East Berlin, during the building of the Berlin Wall, trying to bring her back into West Berlin, but border control stops and arrests him as a spy. The USSR send a message to Donovan, under a false identity, proposing a prisoner exchange: Abel for Powers, Donovan travels to Berlin to begin negotiations, he finds out about the capture of Pryor and is instead insisting on a 2-for-1 exchange. The CIA are only interested in the return of Powers, but Donovan negotiates for Pryor as well, on condition that there is no jeopardising of the Abel-for- Powers deal, however the East German government holding Pryor suddenly pull out, they are insulted Donovan did not inform them of the involvement of the USSR during the negotiation, the CIA want to leave Pryor behind, but Donovan threatens East Germany that the entire deal will be scrapped, Abel could talk, and East Germany would be blamed by the USSR for any damage. In the end, after long hours and patience, Donovan's efforts are rewarded, the exchange is agreed and takes place on the Glienicke Bridge and at Checkpoint Charlie simultaneously, Abel, Powers and Pryor are freed and handed over peacefully to the opposite sides, Donovan gains credit for his achievement. Also starring Amy Ryan as Mary Donovan, Scott Shepherd as Hoffman, The Lives of Others' Sebastian Koch as Wolfgang Vogel, Alan Alda as Thomas Watters Jr., Mikhail Gorevoy as Ivan Schischkin, Eve Hewson as Carol Donovan and Child's Play 3's Dakin Matthews as Judge Byers. Hanks in his fourth Spielberg collaboration as always gives a great everyman performance with stamina, Wolf Hall star Rylance is a great choice as the always calm mole-like dignified man,I was wondering if this film would be complicated or too political, and I'm thankful it wasn't, the real- life story about prisoner exchange and a paranoid climate is very interesting, with the backgrounds and costumes it feels authentic, it is an enjoyably patriotic wartime historical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Matt Charman, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen, Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Original Music, Best Sound, and Best Film.

"Bridge of Spies","SumanShakya","31 March 2016","Steven Spielberg is among the few legendary film makers who have made their prominence for the versatility in the subjects they bring through their films. On one hand, Spielberg had made a touching children drama ""E.T THe Extra Terristrial"" and on the other side gave ""Schindler's List"" documenting history, making it appear larger than life. His versatility continues even today with a touching movie like ""War Horse"" based on the children's novel or a historical movie like ""Bridge of Spies."" May that be 'Empire of the Sun,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or ""Jurassic Park,"" he always had the clarity in story telling and with ""Bridge of Spies"" it seems he is still unbeatable in terms of story telling.""Bridge of Spies,"" as has been narrated, is said to be inspired by true events depicting the cold war of 60s between the United States and the Soviet, during which an American attorney opts to negotiate an exchange between a Soviet Spy and an American pilot and a student. In a way, the film retells a segment of history which we haven't read yet. Whatever the film shows come very strongly and just touches you. An attorney who receives hate from the Americans becomes a negotiator for the US president explains a lot of our central character. in the role, Tom Hanks as usual gives a tremendous performance, which sadly went not nominated this time at the Oscars. But a face that catches your attention the most is Mark Rylance as a Soviet Spy, who won an Oscar for his performance. Even with the minimal dialogues he was given, he makes a prominent presence in the film, for which he deserved the award.Overall, just watch this film to know a part of history, or feel the extraordinary power of Spielberg's story telling, or simply if you're an admirer of Tom Hank's brilliant performance.Rating: 3 stars out of 4","

"Bridge of Spies","bartonj2410","27 November 2015","Bridge of Spies marks the fourth collaboration between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks, a relationship that has gone extremely well thus far. Both of these Hollywood icons seem to bring the best out of each other and all things were pointing towards Bridge of Spies being another winner.Telling the story of James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer who, during the Cold War, is told he will be the defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in court, a man believed to be a Soviet spy.When the American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), is shot down and imprisoned by the Soviet Union, Donovan is then tasked with negotiating an exchange with the Soviets; Powers for Abel at a time when tensions were very high between the two nations.Spielberg is my favourite director and he will go down as one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema. Whether he's dealing with a summer blockbuster or a lower budget drama, Spielberg finds a way for the film to connect with its audience, and Bridge of Spies is no different.The sentimentality that can so often be found in a Spielberg film is usually the key component in that connection and it is ever present in Bridge of Spies, a film that depicts an event in history made possible by one honest man when some thought war was the only option.There were some rewrites carried out on the script, written by Matt Charman however, when you can call upon the likes of Joel and Ethan Coen to spruce it up a bit, you know you are going to get real quality. Every word feels like it counts and there were some genuine moments where I was thinking to myself, ""Yeah, these are the words of the Coen Brothers"", with dashing of light humour sprinkled throughout.Coming to the performances, there were two that, unsurprisingly, stood out for me. Of course, Tom Hanks is one of them, playing the spirited Donovan with a performance full of such wit and charm that he becomes instantly likable and a character the audience will be rooting for.The other is the performance from the lesser known Mark Rylance, an actor known more for his stage roles than his work in front of a camera. As accused spy Abel, Rylance shares a chemistry with Hanks that sees Donovan and Abel seem more like old friends than strangers who have just met. Spielberg was so impressed with Rylance that he offered him the lead part in his upcoming adaptation of The BFG, due next year.Weirdly, for a Spielberg film, the score was not composed by John Williams, who had to drop off the project due to bad health. Thomas Newman stepped up to the plate and, while he does a fine job, his score doesn't do enough to evoke the emotions the way a score from John Williams would.This isn't Spielberg showing off with a big special effects laden film, nor is it a film about spies that you may expect. Bridge of Spies is however, a riveting drama with two Hollywood icons in top form. You'd be crazy not to check it out.","

"Bridge of Spies","statuskuo","18 October 2015","We're going to really miss Spielberg when he retires. IF he retires. This is craft to the highest form. And the attention to every detail is sorely lacking in movies. Craft is IMPOSSIBLE to relate to movie makers today, because it's when talent meets instinct. And we lack instinct.The story is of Tom Hanks who plays defense attorney James Donovan, that deals with insurance policies. As we're introduced in the beginning, he does what every defense attorney does, he spins the truth to meet his client's point. It's a little scheisty, but he's clearly effective. This gathers the attention of his boss, who assigns him the duty to defend an alleged Soviet spy. I don't even believe in due process, unless I'm bustedof course, but he is entitled to a ""fair"" trial. If that is even possible. The United States is under high alert in light of the Cold War (Muslims anyone?) and Germany is rebuildingsort of. With the freeze out of the Russians who've gone deep into secrecy. Were we ever friends? So, now we got a captured Ruskiewhat happens? Well, don't want to give away too much. But he is exactly how we imagine someone captured should act who comes from the Eastern Block. Cold, detached and resigned to their fate.So, now as advertised, we get a spy exchange. But who does it? The C.I.A. washes their hands of the issue. The State Department don't want to be involved? Well, they wrangle Donovan into the mission. Except, it's not a mission. Because if caught or killed Donovan is on his own. Because of the freeze out (literally) of Berlin, and the historical split to East and West, they aren't playing games.The movie isn't the most exciting. Espionage, in the truest sense, would most likely be a lot of waiting. But this moves at a really nice clip and because of craftyou watch every beautiful frame with anticipation of the next visual (beautifully shot on film by Janusz Kaminski).This is a movie that only professionals put together. The minute you watch, you know the people who made it are skilled. There is an easiness, practically effortless (looks like) storytelling. They let the moments between the family develop. The intricacies of our diplomacy made simple despite the thick fog of friends and enemies. A classy sophisticated movie. It's high art.","

"Bridge of Spies","gavinp9","2 January 2018","'Bridge of Spies' is an espionage thriller at its finest. It's set in the late 50s & early 60s and certainly looks the part - I always love seeing the old cars driving around New York, looking classy. Starts off like any classic spy film, but then Abel (Rylance) is caught. In comes Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who is asked to defend Abel, so he can receive due legal practice. The first 45min or so is a good courtroom drama and moves along fast enough, with Hanks giving a few great speeches and making some solid points about what's right and what's best.The movie really captures well the Cold War tension in America and what families would've gone through. It helps that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a few years and the best film Hanks has been in for a while. Once the movie turns into political chess, with an exchange of Abel for Powers (Stowell) in Berlin, the stakes are raised and there's plenty of great subterfuge.Hanks basically owns the film, with everyone having some good moments (especially Rylance, with his ""would it help?""s), but he really plays a great everyman who stands up to both Germany, Russia & his own country (mostly portrayed by the CIA/Shepherd) for what is morally right and just, not just what is politically acceptable at the current time.","

"Bridge of Spies","TxMike","6 May 2016","Watched it on DVD from our local public library.This movie has special significance to me, I was a teenager during the approximate 5-year period this movie is set, about 1957 through about 1962. I remember the news when Powers was shot down in the U2 spy plane over Russia and the cold war propaganda it generated.In this Spielberg movie, ""inspired"" by true events, Tom Hanks is insurance lawyer James B. Donovan. There is an arrest of a suspected Russian spy and the government asks Donovan to be his defense lawyer, allegedly to show the world that even a suspected spy would get proper due process. But it was clear (at least the way this script is written) that all that was wanted was a quick conviction.A critical move was to talk the judge into giving the spy a life sentence instead of death, he reasoned that maybe the spy would eventually talk, but even if he didn't maybe there would be a future opportunity to use him in an exchange.That opportunity came in the early 1960s when Powers was flying a high- altitude U2 photo mission over Russia but was shot down. After that the government asks Donovan to try to negotiate a prisoner swap, to get Powers back. This required him to travel to East Germany as the Berlin wall was being constructed. There is a lot of tension and close calls but the mission is accomplished, also with the release of a young 25-yr-old student who did nothing wrong but was studying Economics in Germany.Surely there are some things fabricated but overall it is a nicely entertaining movie based on real people and real events.","

"Bridge of Spies","gsygsy","27 October 2015","A solid piece of work by Spielberg and his collaborators. Tom Hanks, the James Stewart of our day, incarnates honourable American values but manages, in a way Stewart never would or probably could, to convey his awareness of their fragility. The business of holding fast to one's values in a challenging world is the spine of the film's message, dramatised in the relationship between spy Rudolph Abel and Hanks' character, lawyer James Donovan, in this tale of Cold War brinkmanship.Abel is played by someone who I have no hesitation in naming as one of our era's greatest actors: Mark Rylance. Very familiar to theatre audiences in the UK, he has appeared infrequently on screen. I have a feeling this situation is going to change as a result of his typically superb performance here. Watching him and Hanks play their scenes together was for me the film's main pleasure.Hanks is well partnered too in his scenes with Mikhail Gorevoy as a Russian diplomat and Sebastian Koch as an East German lawyer. Austin Stowell is excellently cast as Gary Powers, the American pilot whose capture reconfigures Abel's fate, and there are a number of other first rate cameos, including Peter McRobbie's turn as John Foster Dulles.The women have a rotten time. Amy Ryan has little to do but smile or worry as Hanks' wife. Nadja Bobyleva manages to make a mark with an emotional scene as the Berlin Wall is being built, one of the film's most chilling sequences.The film's stand-out sequence on the technical front is a terrifying plane crash, one of those jaw-dropping set-pieces that are hallmarks of a Spielberg movie. In this story there's not much room for another of those hallmarks - sentimentality - but where Spielberg can find it - mainly in the scenes around Hanks' family - he puts it in. Still and all, it's definitely worth going to see BRIDGE OF SPIES, not least for Rylance's masterclass in screen acting.","

Bridge of Spies is set in 1950s America and West Germany, and follows the struggles a lawyer has with an exchange of Prisoners.A lot of things add up to the greatness of this Film. Hanks Performamce is one. Another is how Steven Spielberg depicts the publics fear in the 50s. Another would be the beautifully cinematography. The Acting from Hanks, as per usual, is fantastic, and I believe he will be nominee for best Actor. Steven Spielberg also stays true to the original story, and does not twist fact and fiction. Bridge of Spies deserves all the praise it can get. With fantastic Acting and almost perfect direction, Bridge of Spies proves itself one of the finest Films of 2015.","

"Bridge of Spies","pelhamc","14 August 2016","Tom Hanks. Dreamworks Entertainment. Need I say more? This picture was corny. Bridge of Spies follows the true story of a Cold War era insurance lawyer called upon by his country to first defend and then later negotiate the exchange of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel, who looks and sounds weirdly like Sean Connery. Hanks (Mr. Mom, Sully) reprises his reluctant hero role from the Dan Brown series as Jim Donovan, an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances. It had that True Lies if-they-only-knew element to it. The KGB character was played sympathetically, replete with his own catch phrase (was that really necessary?). The closest thing this film has to an antagonist is Donovan's CIA handler. He's ""mean,"" because he doesn't abuse the trust placed in him the way Donovan does, changing mission prerogatives on a personal whim because believes he knows better. The object is an American student being held for sedition by the East Germans. Hanks wants to take him back. The Americans don't value him. So, Hanks hijacks his own hostage swap to make the kid part of the deal. Patriotism is one of the themes, along with loyalty and reputation. This film could have used more spycraft and intrigue. They could have done a lot more with the story. Suspense and courtroom drama were missing. The plot focuses on the character's personal life, without fleshing it out. Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone, Birdman) shines as the wife, but it's a bit part. Donovan's family bares the brunt of public scorn for his defense of an infamous foreign operative. Donovan seems to be stating nonverbally that they'll get over it, it's for the greater good, without bothering to even say as much, against the backdrop of 20th Century nuclear fear. He's sacrificing in strong silence. Or whatever.Bridge of Spies wants to be a ""message movie"" but the didactic is fuzzy, at best. In defense of Abel, Hanks cites the US Constitution. This raises the question as to how the Constitution applies to the case at hand? I must have missed the part dealing with the rights of foreign nationals to spy on America. Donovan avoids the question by simply circulating back to the Constitution itself. It is because it is. Logic is not met with logic. Donovan is not a fighter for critical thinking. Someone recently called Matt Damon the ""Jimmy Stewart of the generation."" I would nominate Tom Hanks for that dubious honor. Methinks Mr. Spielberg should get with the times. The classic formula is less relevant in today's marketplace of media and devoid of creativity. It's cheese with a side of schmaltz.","

I don't find ,much mystery,twist,thriller or interesting drama. The movie was just going on towards successful deal. The opposite parties involved in the negotiation with Tom Hanks are approving for all his demands after every second attempt. All looks very less complicated negotiations.Over hyped may be because of entities shown in the film are big or because of I already read about the incident depicted in the movie. But still there are many movies you will tend to watch again and again even though you read the story and watched already, this one not up to that level.

"Bridge of Spies","rannynm","14 October 2015","This film is nothing other than legendary and an immediate classic. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are back together again, to make another incredible dramatic and genius film. With historical facts, a heartfelt and dramatic story, this film is not only bound to be an Oscar contender, but I think this film may swoop any other film this year, and win the film of the year award.This is a drama. Although it cracks jokes here and there, it really is primarily mainly a dramatic re-enactment of an historical event. The story itself is a large adventure with action and intense scenes filled with various human emotions and unpredictable actions that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.The story starts in the middle of the Cold War, in Brooklyn. A man believed to be a Soviet Spy is arrested and, because of American law, he is supposed to get a fair trial. The man responsible for defending him in court starts noticing things and instead of just making it look like a fair trial, he actually tries to help this 'spy' get the right sort of action.I don't know how Steven Spielberg (director) does it but, he makes these stories come to life and helps you connect with the characters so that you cry, laugh and almost fall of your seat because it's so intense! The camera shots explore the scene from a variety of angles and go way beyond just showing one element. With each camera shot, you are prone to say, ""nice shot."" For example, in one scene, they are on a bridge and, instead of showing a sky high view as you might expect, he shows it from the prospective of the people. It is snowing; you can't see the other side or the people very well. You can just see a few lights and it is just so perfect. If you are a fan of Spielberg's work as I am, you will be happy to see some of his famous wide shots which help scenes seem to float into each other.As for the acting, Tom Hanks has done many roles and this is truly one of his best. He plays a character that does so many dangerous things and does them for a few people that he doesn't even know. He shows extraordinary skill portraying this character, bringing out emotions we can relate to. Full and heartfelt, with each scene his character gets better and better to the point that you are just sitting there with your eyes wide and forgetting to breathe thinking, ""What is he going to do next?"". When he is upset, you're upset. When he is terrified, you're terrified. He is perfect for this role and this is easily one of his best work.For this film, I cannot choose a favorite scene. Each scene is so important in its own way. Each scene is so spectacularly done. Each scene is so entertaining whether it's funny, intense or dramatic One of the scenes that was most impressive is when we see an American spy flying a plane, 70,000 feet over Russian territory. He is gathering intelligence and hoping to get some information about nuclear defenses. His plane is being attacked and the problem is, he was supposed to go down with the plane. The cockpit shatters and he goes into free fall. I love the scene because it looks like he is falling from 70,000 feet at an alarming rate. The execution of this is outstanding. It is clear and intense, which is why I love it so much.The subject of this film is rather mature like the scenes near East Berlin during the time the Berlin Wall was being constructed. A part of Berlin is cut off from food and everything else. There are many other scenes featuring the impact of the Cold War. Because of these, I recommend this for ages 11 to 18. I enthusiastically give it 5 out of 5 stars because this film is legendary. It is mind blowing in so many parts and, I believe it is one of the best films I have ever seen.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.","

"Bridge of Spies","KDPeffley-2","29 September 2021","This is on my top ten list for best acted and best directed films that cover our involvement in the Cold War. How can you go wrong with actors Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance? They are superb. And Spielberg's direction gives us a great mix of historical perspective and suspense, because frankly almost none of us living really remember the details of these events as they actually played out. You'd have to be 90 years old or a history wank to know what's going to happen, so we are given Tom Hanks as the lawyer James Donovan to guide us through those difficult times. Mark Rylance plays the Russian spy whom Donovan defends at the expense of his career, family and death threats. Rylance, who also played Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall, is completely believable as the honorable, dead pan, Russian spy who can't help but be admired, if not for being a spy, but for his gentle manner and humanity. Hanks and Rylance are most memorable, but the story never plays second fiddle. Mixed with the embarrassing events of the U2 spy plane, the backdrop of our fear of Russia, and the dreary, dark winter of living in East Berlin, we are given a perfectly entertaining account of serious times.","

"Bridge of Spies","Evan_Wheatley","11 April 2017","When the director of ""Jaws,"" the star of ""Forrest Gump"" and the writers of ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" come together to make a film, you know you're in for a treat.""Bridge of Spies"" is set in 1957 during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested by the FBI and charged with being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked by his partners to defend Abel in the impending trial. Donovan is ridiculed and scorned by his fellow Americans for representing and defending Abel, as many of them would rather see him hanging from a rope. However, Donovan's success in keeping Abel away from the death penalty proves vital in negotiating with the Soviets after they capture an American spy. Whenever I watch Tom Hanks, seldom do I see Tom Hanks. Whether it's Forrest Gump, Captain John H. Miller or Woody from ""Toy Story,"" Hanks consistently excels at becoming the characters he portrays, and he delivers a dynamic performance as James Donovan. The character is decent and kind, but firm in upholding the law and his personal values. Mark Rylance's portrayal of Rudolf Abel is Oscar-worthy. Abel is an awkward, mild-mannered and unusually calm elderly man, the last person you would suspect as a Soviet spy. In the face of potential execution following a guilty verdict, Abel remains cool and collected. Blown away by his lack of alarm or concern, Donovan questions, ""Are you not worried?"" to which Abel responds, ""Would it help?"" Ethan and Joel Coen's script dishes out the perfect comedic, dramatic and thrilling elements that make ""Bridge of Spies"" great. Its dialogue drives the story, and while this may turn off certain audiences, I found it enthralling. Fundamental themes of integrity, perseverance and standing up for what's right are broadcast clearly and effectively through the actions and words of the story's protagonists. Like most of his films, Steven Spielberg's touch is evident from the first shot. There are several scenes throughout the film in which two or more people are simply exchanging dialogue in a room. While on paper this may come across as dull, Spielberg keeps you engaged by positioning his characters in different places during a scene. Through this he is able to portray a variety of shot types and angles and simulate the effect of cuts that aren't actually there.Spielberg's narrative direction is as captivating as his visual storytelling. ""Bridge of Spies"" is based on a true story, and very little is altered or fabricated for the sake of entertainment. Aside from a few minor plot points and inconsistencies of the spies' time in captivity, Spielberg and the Coen brothers stay true to the intriguing story of how an insurance lawyer from Brooklyn saved the lives of two Americans and a Soviet spy.Novelty in today's cinema is a hallowed treasure. Unique scripts are replaced with unnecessary sequels and reboots, and dialogue-driven stories dwell in the shadow of the next Marvel blockbuster. Despite Hollywood's ever-growing lack of originality, directors like Spielberg continually restore my faith in filmmaking. ""Bridge of Spies"" breathes new life into historical thrillers, and is a must-see for lovers of the genre.","

Anyone can turn a large scale event such as Dunkirk, or Stalingrad but to turn something much more minor and make it give an effect ranking with them events requires true skill. ​Beautiful music to show tension, heart warming moments and even the brutality such as the train sequence, speaking of which was jaw dropping. The ending was so very well done and came full circle to the movies prior events though I feel the actual final negotiations could have been done a little better. ​Bad: The first act is quite slow and dull but it makes up for it after that. Some scenes could be taken away or cut down. Some subplots and minor characters such as the journalist, while possibly historically accurate, felt out of place and could have meant more if explored more thoroughly.

"Bridge of Spies","CinemaSerf","2 January 2024","New York attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is drafted in to provide what can only be described as a cursory defence for alleged Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) whom the establishment want to offer an ostensibly open and fair, but actually only a rather rudimentary, trial. This doesn't sit well with Donovan, and he manages to get the judge to commute the death sentence to one of thirty years. That proves to be visionary because shortly afterwards, US pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is off doing a little spying of his own when he is shot down over East Germany. Donovan is now drafted in by his government to travel to Berlin, without formal status, and see if he can't negotiate a prisoner swap. What now ensues is a true story that wouldn't look out of place in a John le Carré novel. Lots of dogma-driven mistrust, manipulation and a fair smattering of who needs to win the PR battle - especially complicated when the East Germans take a student hostage and he must now try to get both out - a two for one deal! Hanks is on good form delivering a measured and considered effort as the ingenious lawyer with a conscience, and Rylance also performs well, if really too sparingly, as the prisoner who is also a man of principle - though slightly less sure of the nature of his welcome at home should Donovan succeed. The film looks good, is nicely scored by Thomas Newman and we get a genuine sense of just how battered Berlin was as the wall started to go up. Perhaps a little on the lengthy side - but still a solid piece of biopic cinema well worth a watch.","

"Bridge of Spies","deloudelouvain","14 January 2016","That was a pleasant movie to watch. I didn't get bored for one second despise the length of the movie. It's interesting to watch the way things happened during the cold war. The American propaganda, the brainwashed American people, the evil communists, we're good and they are bad and so on... It could still apply now when I think about it. Americans are still brainwashed by the media on daily basis. It's so normal for them after all those years that they have absolutely no clue whatsoever that they are being controlled by their government. Same things happen here in Europe as well though, but on smaller basis. I wonder when people will stop thinking everything that appears on television must be true? Never I guess because humans are just sheep and easily distracted from real problems. But back to the movie. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance were to me the two best actors in Bridge of Spies. Great acting in a story that keeps you interested for more then two hours. If you like some drama with a touch of biography then you will like this movie. I, for sure did, and will probably watch it again in the future.","

"Bridge of Spies","TheFirstExecutioner","28 February 2016","Bridge of Spies is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks, which is the best director-actor duo in history in my opinion. Once again, Tom Hanks is so good as a lawyer who has to defend a Soviet spy during the Cold War. But probably the best performance was Mark Rylance, the man who played the Soviet spy, and he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination. The cinematography is so beautiful and Spielberg perfectly captures the world in 1957.Most of this movie is conversations between Hanks and others during negotiations or court room scenes. A lot of people can be turned off by this, claiming it's ""too boring."" But if you like drama with a lot of intrigue about history, you will be engrossed in Bridge of Spies. It is a slow and long movie, so you have to be patient while watching. However, there is a fantastic scene with an airplane that brings energy into the movie.Bridge of Spies is certainly not one of Spielberg's masterpieces, but it is still a great movie on its own. Bridge of Spies gets an A.","

"Bridge of Spies","jimbo-53-186511","29 October 2016","James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is a lawyer who practices in 'insurance' law, but when he's tasked with defending Soviet spy and traitor Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) it proves to be a case that is not only career-defining for Donovan, but one that is also life-changing as well.Bridge Of Spies was a film that did hold my interest and have me gripped (up until the conclusion of Abel's trial). However, from this point on, at least as far as I was concerned, it gradually became less and less interesting....The first problem lies with how the film has been structured - Bridge Of Spies is a film that runs for over 2 hours, but in those 2 + hours the film essentially only has two threads hanging it together (Abel's trial and the exchange of prisoners). What you get here is about 45 minutes of trial and about 90 minutes of Donovan's various conversations with government officials. As I've said the first third of it is OK, but the final two thirds of the picture are repetitive and rather dull and it quickly becomes evident that the prisoner exchange aspect of the story does not necessitate 90 minutes worth of screen time.The next issue lies with how imbalanced the whole film feels; as I've said great portions of the film are spent on both Abel's trial and on Donovan's wonderful negotiating skills in effecting the prisoner exchanges, but Spielberg and his team of scriptwriters (2 of whom are the Coen brothers) seem to overlook other aspects of the film such as what happened to Abel whilst he was in the US? What happened to Powers when he was captured in Russia? What happened to the American student whilst he was held in Germany? Spielberg sets all these plot points up on an assembly line, but doesn't delve deeper into any of these plot points which at times means that the film lacks depth and insight. I was particularly disappointed that Powers didn't factor as prominently in the story considering that he was quite an important character.Rylance won an Oscar for his performance here which I personally found a bit puzzling (yes he's OK, but I didn't really see anything brilliant about his performance). Hanks again is OK but he generally gives a fairly stock 'everyman' performance which isn't that big a stretch for him.When all is said and done I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed by Bridge Of Spies; to me it put too much focus in some areas and not enough focus in other areas which resulted in an imbalanced and poorly structured film. I think the best way to summarise it would be 'interesting subject matter that was poorly delivered.'","

"Bridge of Spies","suite92","2 December 2016","The Three Acts: The initial tableaux: In 1957, the FBI arrests Rudolf Abel for espionage against the United States. For propaganda reasons, not for being true to American ideals, the powers that be select James to be the council of Abel. James tries to represent Abel well, and receives stiff resistance for his efforts. He does establish that the US should treat its prisoners well at least for the hope that our imprisoned soldiers or agents will receive reasonable behavior from jailers.In 1960, the Russians shoot down the U2 reconnaissance plane flown by Francis Gary Powers over the USSR, and imprison him afterward. Powers has a great deal of classified intelligence that might be divulged. The Russians want Abel back; the Americans want Powers back.Delineation of conflicts: James is 'requested' to negotiate the swap, but is not given diplomatic recognition, and must work as a private citizen. The East Germans detain Pryor, an economics PhD student as a spy to use as a chess piece.James has to deal with a lot of murkiness, since none of the transactions are done officially. He has to deal with the Russians to get Powers, and the East Germans to get Pryor. The Russians and East Germans have their own agendas.Resolution: There's a lot of juggling, but it turns out relatively well.","

"Bridge of Spies","bix171","31 January 2016","Especially with his adult entries, Steven Spielberg has made a claim for being perhaps America's most elegant filmmaker, with shrewd choices in material coupled with effective storytelling skills highlighted by precise framing and expert use of tracking cameras (in collaboration with his superb cinematographer Janusz Kaminski). ""Bridge Of Spies"", while not quite reaching the Hitchcockian suspense and psychological depth of ""Munich"", nonetheless is a very fine example of Spielberg working with commitment and intensity to provide the mature film-goer a satisfying, thoughtful experience. Here, the Cold-War plot (based on true events) is fairly cut-and-dried: a Russian spy (Mark Rylance), unsuccessfully defended by attorney Tom Hanks, is used as a negotiating tool to retrieve downed spy pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) and, against the wishes of the CIA spook (Scott Shepherd) fronting the mission in Berlin, a student trapped on the other side of the Wall (Will Rogers). Working from a beautifully written script by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers (supressing their smarm for a change), Spielberg underplays the action, working off body and facial nuance and well-timed, eloquent dialogue. The performers act with grace, particularly Hanks, continuing his transformation into the elder statesman of Hollywood film, and Rylance, whose placidity in the face of abandonment and death is appealing and entertaining. The only thing marring the film is Thomas Newton's score: while understated, it appears at inappropriate moments, distracting from the action on screen. But this is a minor quibble. The overall result is plausible and accessible--a very admirable addition to the impressive yet under-appreciated Spielberg canon.","

Though the whole film is talkative. No fights, no actions, just chatting. So, many may not like this. I'm in that category. Background score is nowhere in the film, and may be it's a plus point.

"Bridge of Spies","Wizard-8","16 June 2016","I'm not sure what caused me to pick up ""Bridge of Spies"" when I found a Blu-ray copy of it at my library, since its length and the fact that it had Tom Hanks (an actor who usually gives me annoyance) seemed to be obstacles. But I'm glad I did. While the movie is long (140 minutes), credit director Steven Spielberg for making the package chug along fairly briskly, while at the same time showing that the world of espionage in real life is often a lot of work and not flashy business. The acting is also pretty good; even I had to admit that Tom Hanks does a pretty good job here, giving his character a kind of everyman feel that gives him sympathy.The only real flaw that the movie has is that it doesn't go into depth enough with some key details - namely the backstory of both Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and American pilot Francis Gary Powers. Now, I actually knew a lot about their real life stories before watching the movie, so I was able to fill in the blanks. But I suspect most viewers will know little to nothing about both men before watching the movie, so they may be scratching their heads every so often. However, I will admit devoting more time to these real life individuals may have made the movie overlong. So you may want to research both individuals before watching this movie.","

"Bridge of Spies","PrashunChakraborty","19 October 2015","I don't think I can criticize this movie, it's a Spielberg film after all, nearly flawlessly made, Tom Hanks is excellent as usual (but let's face it Tom Hanks has never acted poorly in ANY film EVER), mostly historically accurate as well. In fact if it would have been made by anyone else I may have liked it a lot more than I currently do, but alas Steven Spielberg has become a victim to his own success and ability. So all I can say is that while this movie is solid it's nothing spectacular, there are no great scenes but the story is well done and it's evenly represented, a couple of weeks ago I watched Edward Zwick's Pawn Sacrifice and found it to be very pro American and anti Russian, Spileberg of course is above all this pettiness and delivers a balanced film in which both sides are fairly represented. However, I was expecting the raw power that Spielberg delivered in Munich (last time he tackled the theme of espionage) but that's not what this movie is about, it feels a lot simpler and the stakes never feel high. Bridge of spies is a good movie and can go on the B-Side of Steven Spielberg's greatest hits along with The Terminal, Lincoln, War Horse etc. while the A side continues to have Schindler's List, Saving private Ryan, Raiders of the lost ark etc.","

The Germany especially the East Berlin side was grim and bleak under communism.

His family endured bullying and taunting from friends, neighbors and colleagues. Tom Hanks was perfect in the role by the way. Alan Alda also played a supporting role.

"Bridge of Spies","siderite","30 December 2015","Personally I thought the movie was a bit too heavy-handed and that the ending was way more melodramatic than it should have been. But the movie was good. More than that, it is a story that must be shown today. I felt the ending kind of ruined the effect a little bit, though.The story is that of a lawyer who believes in the law - imagine that - and because of his extraordinary efforts to defend a Russian spy in the heavily patriotic legal system from 1957 he is tagged to intermediate a prisoner exchange. You get this idea directly from the trailer and the plot, as it were, is not deviating from that. Instead, it is Hanks' acting and Spielberg's directing that you need to appreciate, as they masterfully make the case for the spirit of America, not for its power.The film is based on a real person, and his own autobiographical book, and it is well rendered, albeit a bit paint-by-numbers. The title of my review is more accurate than I would have wanted. Even so, I felt that the first part of the movie was great and that it should have been a film on its own. You get a man that is doing his job and upholding the moral values Americans are so proud of by defending a man that everyone thinks is despicably guilty and as reward gets scoffed at, gets the evil eye and even has shots fired at his house - 2nd amendment style - from a driving by car, only to be blamed for it by the police officers called to investigate. He returns to his job only to find that cases he was assigned to were reassigned and his partners are reluctant to speak to him.That message is far more relevant today than the general result driven heroics that movies - including this one - usually portray. The point is that good means different things for different people and therefore it never actually wins. The fact that Donovan had a successful career as a negotiator later on is good for Donovan, but I felt it hurt the movie.","

"Bridge of Spies","Zoltanko","17 October 2015","It's easy to get caught up in the magnificent acting performances of this film's phenomenal international cast. Of course you expect Tom Hanks to put his usual Oscar-worthy skills on display, and he does in scene after scene. But everyone in the supporting cast is equally as memorable, not to mention Mark Rylance, who is one of the most talented actors many people may not recognize or even be familiar with. It's also easy to get caught up in the beautiful, period cinematography, locations and sets in Bridge of Spies. The look and feel of both early 1960's America plus the depressing starkness of East Berlin during the escalation of the Cold War are depicted perfectly.But what came through to me more than any of these individual pieces is the unsurpassed storytelling skills of Steven Spielberg. Not only does he get one of the best performances out of Hanks in his entire career, but his attention to detail and nuance is utterly amazing. When Hanks is confused, Spielberg makes sure you are as well. When he's feeling anxious or paranoid, the director makes you equally as apprehensive. But he does this with visual cues, glances, hints and a marvelous musical score.This is cinema at its purest and its best. Dialog is less important than the visuals, but the script is tight, crisp and taught. Nothing is wasted. In a season when there have been a great many outstanding films to hit the screen (Mr. Holmes, Black Mass, Everest) Bridge of Spies is a must-see for anyone who loves a well-told story that will make you wonder how two hours can fly by so quickly.","

"Bridge of Spies","cherold","31 January 2017","Bridge of Spies tells the story of lawyer James B Donovan's defense of a Russian spy and subsequent role as a negotiator in the trade of that spy for U.S. pilot Gary Powers.It didn't strike me as that intriguing a story, honestly, but I like director Stephen Spielberg so I thought I'd take a look.The result is surprisingly engaging. The story is simple but interesting, the movie deftly sketches out cold war tensions, and there are solid doses of humor and drama. While I often find Tom Hanks a little too noble, he nicely underplays Donovan, who comes across not, like a lot of Hanks' roles, as a man so noble that he is on the verge of tears at his own nobility, but rather a smart lawyer with a great deal of integrity. There are no speeches, no tearful moments, but you wind up really admiring the guy.Even better is Mark Rylance as the Russian spy, an odd, phlegmatic little guy with his own kind of integrity.While the movie is entertaining and absorbing, it is a movie that, like Spielberg's Lincoln, feels a little too careful and educational to really bring history to life the way a movie like Spotlight does. Spielberg seems to have lost interest in taking chances (I really think he should break out of his mold and make a Dogme 95-style film), and that can make his films seem a touch stodgy, but he still has that remarkable directorial expertise, and certainly knows how to make a movie.","

Powers was ultimately repatriated in a prisoner exchange, and the film is told from the perspective of the civilian lawyer who negotiated the deal. Tom Hanks plays the lead as an All-American, squared-jawed liberal lion, but the film is nicely nuanced, with just one moment of corn (where Hanks happens to see some wannabe escapees from East Berlin shot in the act). Spileberg directs and the Cohen brothers wrote the script, so the film's basic competenace is hardly surprising; but it's nicely nuanced story with a Le Carre-esque mood, with just one moment of corn (where Hanks happens to see some wannabe escapees from East Berlin shot in the act).

"Bridge of Spies","caseynicholson","17 January 2016","If you're a fan of historical dramas--films based on true stories and the like--then you definitely should check out ""Bridge of Spies"". I found this movie to be absolutely great, and it's very easy to see how and why it's been nominated for Best Picture.Perhaps the strongest part of this film is its overall production. I didn't know a thing about the movie going into it (I watched it as part of my attempt at seeing all of the 2016 Best Picture nominees), and so I had no clue that it's a Steven Spielberg film. That said, when you see this movie you'll be reminded of what true craftsmanship looks like in a film production. The scenes, the camera work, pretty much everything in this film just comes together to make it an outstanding effort in filmmaking.I also can say that I enjoyed Tom Hanks in this performance. I do sometimes have trouble getting into Tom Hanks movies these days, as he's sort of become too big of a star--I always see him as himself rather than as whoever he's playing on screen. That was true for ""Bridge of Spies"" as well, but the role of a random New York attorney in the middle of the 20th Century makes that whole aspect less bothersome than if he were playing a more well known historical figure.All that said, I seriously considered giving this movie a perfect 10, and I can see how many people might do just that. I've held back from the perfect rating for one lone aspect, and that's that this movie probably doesn't have the ""epic"" feel to it that I tend to want to reserve a perfect score for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is a fantastic movie that will entertain you for a couple of hours--but fifteen years from now it's probably not going to be a movie that you remember too much about. The story provides great escapism for the moment, but it just isn't so mind blowing or suspenseful that it warrants being thought of in the same category as, for me, an ""Unforgiven"" or a ""Chinatown"". Thus my 9/10 star rating.","

Well, because of all of the bad puns and jokes that have no place in a movie like this. Also, because of all of the dead air and space that Spielberg left in the movie for 'effect' (like a clock ticking for 20 seconds to illustrate that Tom Hanks was bored... Thanks.) Oh, and it was also long from all of the interludes filled with terrible orchestral music. Music can make a film, and there were times where the music was as bad as the jokes. No one wants to tell the Legendary Spielberg and Iconic Hanks that less is more, so we are left with a movie that will be forgotten by the next decade.One bright spot - the scene where Gary Powers' plane gets shot down is brilliant (not a spoiler - it was in your history textbook in 9th grade).

With a slow development of events, which is noteworthy completely without musical accompaniment (a rarity in modern cinema). The second part, this is already an action movie in the style of M (James Bond), where the whole action is accelerated and at least repel the turnover of musical accompaniment. And the second part is terrible. In the first, the USSR and the GDR are shown as barbarians. Great propaganda. The most important thing is how Spielberg fakes the facts. Berlin was bombed not by the USSR, but by the Allies. The USSR, on the contrary, helped restore the ruins of eastern Berlin. And finally Abel in the USSR was recognized as a hero and confirmed the status of a spy. And to talk about the light in which the GDR is represented does not have to, some kind of ghetto.
And most importantly, 2 part of the film is a natural B-movie, which you watch by inertia and only for the sake of acting by Tom Hanks.","

It is a bit maybe to Hollywodical"" here and there, but this is a highly involving movie and superbly crafted movie which takes place in seemingly forgotten time.

"Bridge of Spies","rubenm","7 December 2015","Who would ever have thought that the Coen Brothers would co-write a film directed by Steven Spielberg? At first sight, it seems a very improbable combination. On the one hand the traditional Hollywood giant of blockbuster fame, and on the other hand the unruly creators of weird characters and unorthodox stories.This could have been a disaster: a terrible clash of two styles of film making. But in fact, it is a wonderful cooperation. The film is mostly made according to the standard Spielberg recipe of big drama, but seasoned with some very tasteful spices of Coen-like creativity and dry humour.I think I recognized some very clear Coen-moments in the film. At one point the hero of the story, American lawyer James Donovan, walks into the Russian embassy in Berlin hoping to meet an official called Mr Vogel, but instead is greeted by a bunch of rumpled peasants. This is, I think, typical for the Coen Brothers. One other very recognizable Coen-moment is Donovan's visit to the East German prosecutor, who picks up the wrong phone. This whole scene is filmed in the slightly surrealistic way that characterizes many Coen-films 'Bridge of Spies' is a cold war drama. It tells the true story of a righteous American lawyer who defends a Russian spy, learns to appreciate his professionalism and subsequently is asked to negotiate an exchange of prisoners in Berlin. The screenplay is very clever, with three spy stories woven into one narrative: the Russian spy in the US, an American pilot who is captured by the Russians after his plane is shot down, and an American student who happens to be in the wrong part of Berlin when the Wall is built.Sometimes Spielberg accentuates the dramatic effects a bit too much, for example when the student tries to leave the Eastern section of Berlin and sees how the last peace of concrete closes the Wall between him and the West. But on the whole this film is cinematographic craftsmanship at its very best. The screenplay keeps on introducing new, exciting story elements, the sober but effective acting by Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance is spot on, and the period sets recreate the Cold War era perfectly. It is hard not to like this film.","

"Bridge of Spies","damianphelps","10 October 2020","I have enjoyed Tom Hanks' transition from average comedic actor to top line dramatic actor so the juices were flowing at the chance to watch him in a political/war drama.Unfortunately the film never really delivers the punch that it could have. I'm not talking about action bells and whistles rather, some scenes that really spark and capture the imagination. To get to the next level from ok or passable to good and then great a movie has to have an impact one way or another.Bridge of Spies whilst ok fails to deliver any note-worthy moments that could have propelled it to something special.","

"Bridge of Spies","kislaykaushal22","18 October 2015","Set in the Cold War era, in Brooklyn, Bridge of Spies is a story about a successful insurance prosecutor, James B Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is given a case to defend a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A true nationalist and yet an idealist lawyer, James draw a lot of flak from his men for his earnest and professional efforts in the case. But soon, his ideology leads him to a precarious task of rescuing an American pilot, a task gravely sensitive for the two conflicting nations. The movie is not a nail biting thriller which the title or the trailer or Saving Private Ryan might have suggested. This is a very evenly paced drama, predictable for most of the time but boasts of meticulous details, a hallmark of Mr Spielberg. The story is inherently a little weak, yet Mr Spielberg manages to spin off a decent movie out of it. James and Rudolf really hit it off and it is fun to watch them together. Tom Hanks is at his usual best and Mark Rylance befits the character of an extraordinarily wise, artistic and resolute Russian soldier. Other characters are not of much significance and a couple of them actually seem needless. The movie follows a depiction of the event as it happened and doesn't display any deliberate dramatization. Consequently, it doesn't evoke any strong emotions while watching which some people might actually prefer. Personally, I believe a better connect and impact would have made this movie far more memorable. This definitely is a decent, American film which scores completely on actors, cinematography (involving 1960 Brooklyn) and direction. But considering what Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks have done before, I had stomach for more.","

"Bridge of Spies","highstreet28","9 October 2016","Predictable stuff from Hollywood - shallow and very disappointing. Spielberg doing a kids version of a spy story. Poor Tom Hanks goes to Berlin to save the world from communism, and rescues the youth of America. And all he gets is the sniffles. Violins on the bridge, before dawn, for goodness sake. Given the accolades, I was hoping for something more suited for an adult audience. Rylance is a good actor, but that doesn't make it a good film, just watchable when he is in the scene. And those poor kids of Hank's - subject to such hatred because big daddy stood up for justice and the American flag. It isn't even interesting from the historic recreation of New York - just a demonstration of how much money can be spent on a movie that really doesn't tell much of a story. There could have been more depth, and less devotion to period drama. And the script was pretty dire at many points - dialogue when no words were needed at all.","

"Bridge of Spies","Red_Identity","24 December 2015","I really do hope the only awards this film wins are for Mark Rylance. He is incredibly mesmerizing in the role. It's a very subtle one, but he commands your gaze and attention any time he is on screen. I don't think many actors could have given the role so much effect, especially such a quiet one, but he managed to do that and more. The problem is that he's stuck in a film that is completely and thoroughly just fine. The good thing is that, except for the sentimental ending, Steven Spielberg doesn't interfere too much with the story around him. He is mostly restrained. Overall, this isn't something I will be aching to rewatch any time soon, and not something I will remember. Although it's quicker in pacing, definitely not nearly the film that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is, but it's not bad at all.","

"Bridge of Spies","DareDevilKid","12 February 2016","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.8/5 starsWith ""Bridge of Spies"", Steven Spielberg infuses new life in Hollywood's all-but-forgotten Cold War espionage thrillers from the 70s and 80s. He goes about creating an arresting, sometimes haunting milieu in the midst of a mission of wits and high-intensity at the height of the Cold War, where American attorney James B. Donovan is recruited by the CIA to negotiate the release of a US spy-plane pilot - shot down and captured in Soviet territory - in exchange of a KGB spy, Rudolf Abel, who was arrested for espionage in the US.Spielberg enters full-blown Stanley Kramer mode, and triumphantly delivers (like he has on numerous times in his distinguished career) a socially conscious tale of back-and-forth diplomacy and behind- closed-doors politics at home, at the office, and on the global stage. At the same time, he doesn't let up the tension for a moment in this richly-detailed narrative where the interactions between smart and unpredictable characters is the main focus of the Director and his writers (the maverick Coen Brothers; avant-garde filmmakers in their own right). And, eventually, it's these interactions that are the core foundation of ""Bridge of Spies"", with its real strength lying in the bond developed between its two main characters - unwitting negotiator Donovan (Tom Hanks in fine form) and incarcerated Soviet spy Abel (Mark Rylance deservedly an Oscar nominee). The warm portrait of a highly unlikely friendship is perhaps the movie's greatest achievement, even more than its sublime Direction, crisp writing, lasting cinematography, and exemplary performances.Steven Spielberg and the Coen Brothers take on the Cold War and spy world with a visually stunning, tension-filled, and surprisingly feel-good thriller that slithers along with gripping intensity and tantalizing uncertainty.","

"Bridge of Spies","kekca","6 January 2016","Okay. Because of the perspective of every idealistic person and mostly because this movie is based on real historical events it should be also presented here. Yes, the world has the need of such persons, regardless of age, gender, nationality. The final explanations in the film can best explain this.About that the highest human nature does not recognize propensities and is capable of creativity. Often transcend the established order and shines above it, although we know many cases where it remains neglected, gray and misunderstood.About the nonsense that we have caused to ourselves some time ago, and are still trying to inflict. About complete rethinking of our values. About the price and the meaning of human existence. About farsightedness and nearsightedness, which in both cases are defects, equally different world views.About the cult of personality, but also of the way that it is displayed. More decently for the one who receive himself as surpassing it will always be better if he is modest and non-woven. I.e. it may be added further quality and quantity to be removed.

"Bridge of Spies","tabuno","13 January 2019","24 October 2015. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance star in this amazing, intense, and compelling movie about the behind the scenes negotiations between James Donovan, a United States lawyer, and the U.S.S.R. and East Germany for the exchange of Rudolph Abel, a convicted Russian spy and Gary Powers, whose American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Russia in 1961. This mainstream movie directed by Steven Spielberg brings great cinematography, setting, and performances to build the tension, suspense through acting and script especially without action and fireworks. This is truly a big screen, big tent-pole event movie based on historic events as well as the poignant fear and importance of the human spirit in the face of a frightening, uncertain foreign world.There is a pungent feeling of both dread and hope in this dark mysterious world of espionage. Bridge of Spies carries its weight of deeper psychological warfare reminiscent of John LeCarre's classic Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy (1979) or Breach (1997) and with setting a similar tone and flavor of The American (2010) or Sum of All Fears (2002) as well as a same period spy movie The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965) or The Russia House (1990) presenting a smaller scale, or the more broader sweep found in The Good Shepard (2006), all possessing a powerful espionage theme. This movie is riveting, capturing the visceral emotive uncertainty and fear, sometimes powerlessness, and sometimes faithful confidence that arises from an understanding the serious game being played. In addition there are some nicely timed and edited subtle humor to balance the drama occurring on screen. Overall, this is one of the best movies of the year.","

"Bridge of Spies","eleagece","25 January 2016","When Spielberg is behind the cameras you know you're going to watch a movie which is at least correct. Luckily, Bridge of Spies is more than correct: it's a remarkable film from start to finish.Its strenghts are the great staging, the dark and cold photography and the rock-solid acting. There is nothing more to be said about Tom Hanks, he is able to make crappy films like Da Vinci Code entertaining, so in a good movie like this one, it's obvious he nails it. I've loved the other main character, Mark Rylance as the Russian spy. He transmits composure no matter what is going around him. The ties that bind his character to Hanks' one trascend the main plot and send a bright message: people have essentially the same values, and if we are confronted is just because of the part of the board we started from when we were born.Its weaknesses, well... no risks taken. The plot is predictable and based in values overused in cinema like friendship, loyalty and honesty. Even the cinematography: after so many movies Spielberg knows himself too well, and his way of managing the resources seems obvious. Don't get me wrong, that is great because with an interesting story we have an interesting movie, but far from that feeling of novelty that makes a film special. To be precise: there are shots which feel like copy-paste from other of his movies (those scenes with headlights in backlighting, those slow chases, those cars moving and braking to stop in front of the camera...) and the pace is sometimes quite slow (there are scenes in which Spielberg shows the exact same thing from different angles, adding really nothing to the movie but redundant information). But anyway, it's an enjoyable movie. In fact the best from Spielberg lately.","

"Bridge of Spies","adamjohns-42575","3 November 2020","I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did. Cold War, historical things don't usually float my boat that much, but the story itself was very interesting and played very well.Based on real events, essentially it is about James Donovan's (Hanks) refusal to endure injustice, as he fights for the rights of Rudolf Abel (Rylance), back in 1957.
Later we learn that Donovan is almost as much of a humanitarian as Schindler with the work he does in Cuba, but we don't see that in this film, it's just interesting to see that he wouldn't be swayed by anything. He firmly believes in the law and stands by it.Both of the lead actors give outstanding performances, as you would expect and deliver a tale that could have been quite dull or something we've seen before.
It's funny how we have seen so many films these days that we have come to expect horrible things or sudden changes of circumstance to hit right at crucial moments and then we realise that it is a bio-pic and things don't always happen like that in real life. It actually adds to the tension and makes stories new again, because it changes the current formula of movies. Sometimes even when you know how the history actually turned out, you can still find yourself expecting the hero to be shot, even though you know he grows up to become the president or something?Based on the IMDB Trivia section, very few bits were added to flesh out the story and none of them really make much difference to how it made me feel, so you are getting quite a genuine interpretation of the events as the occurred.This film actually taught me a few things I didn't know, showing up huge gaps in my historic and geographic knowledge, but if you're more clever than me (It's not hard (That's what she said)) you may not experience this. I had no idea the USSR had control over East Germany and that's what the wall was all about, but then I did fail my Mock history exam and never turned up for the real thing. I shouldn't have taken all those days off school.I can't really say what made this one so good, but it's probably a lot of things all coming together as one, the filming, lighting, direction, sets, costume, all working collectively alongside the superb acting perhaps?","

Steven Spielberg once again made a great movie, and just like I said about Ridley Scott about how great it is that we still can go to the cinema today and see a new movie directed by an icon.Steven Spielberg is the type of director you never know what you're going to get and I'm talking about the type of film making he uses. Spielberg will always make a well directed movie even when some of his movies are not great or something you'll never watch again, it will still be well directed. Steven Spielberg's directing in Bridge of Spies was absolutely superb, because every scene is so perfectly crafted and Spielberg knows when to cut to a emotional reaction with the characters. These a couple of scenes in this movie that I didn't notice was all in one long wide take with no breaks, and that's because I was so locked in on what was going on with the characters and the scene itself. Spielberg brilliance is still present today as he's masterful style of film making is still alive today. If you love that kind of film making that's so masterful, perfect and old school, then Bridge of Spies might be the movie for you. This is one of the best directed films I've seen this year.Tom Hanks is one of the most lovable and respected actors of are times, as in every role he dose, he never disappoints. This is he's fourth collaboration with Spielberg after: Catch Me If You Can, Saving Private Ryan and The Terminal, and in Bridge of Spies Hanks once again deliverers a magnificent and believable performance. This is an Oscar worthy performance as he made his character so relatable, funny and very likable. Without spoiling anything, there's a scene in this movie where Tom Hanks character (James Donovan) gets followed by this unknown figure and at one point Donovan goes to sit at this restaurant to confront this man and the scene itself is just amazing, because Donovan knocks this guy to the ground with no action, just dialogue. Tom Hanks was amazing in this movie.Another performance that blow me away was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. I have seen this actor before in the hit TV show ""Wolf Hall"", and he was great in that show, but he impressed the hell out of me in this movie, because Mark Rylance was absolutely fantastic. This guy deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and I hope he dose, because it would be a huge sub if he doesn't get nominated. Mark Rylance was fan-freaking-tastic in this movie.The cinematography was excellent, the score was great, the dialogue is outstanding and the story was really good.Now for the problems: These a couple of scenes around the second act that wasn't that interesting to me.If you don't like talky movies then you may not enjoy Bridge of Spies, because this whole movie is nothing but talking and I know some people may not find that enjoyable. I'm the kind of person who likes dialogue driven movies and that's why I enjoyed this movie, because of the movies excellent dialogue and I how locked in I was while watching it, but I know it's not going to be for everyone and if you think this movie is boring because it's a talky movie then that's fine.Overall Bridge of Spies isn't Spielberg's greatest movie compared to his other ones, but it is a well crafted movie with excellent performances, fantastic directing and great writing. Bridge of Spies is the best Cold War thriller I've ever seen.","

What will make me wonder for a while is how on earth did Mark Rylance win an Oscar as an actor in supporting role for this particular movie, and Tom Hanks was not even nominated? Yet again, to date I don't understand how Emily Blunt was not nominated as a best actress for The Girl on the Train... I will never understand how the Globes and Oscars committee work to give the credits.

Watching masters doing what they have done over and over, for many years is OK, but felt stale. It's a good story, well acted, directed and written, but lacked spark. The first 30 minutes or so seemed pointless. They make good use of period cars but that was about it. Anticipated Schindler's List, but got 1941, not great. There is a moral compass but the energy was flat. Something is missing, no excitement, no chemistry. The family scenes felt inauthentic, forced intimacies.

He rightly takes all the plaudits, but some must be left for Mark Rylance who is also brilliant as Abel. The support cast also more than pull their weight, too.Undeniably worth your time.

The story itself is great, the insurance lawyer ending up way over his head, but approaching it with perfect calm. The mysterious spy. THe tension of the cold war. And the people involved in making this movie are also fantastic. From the Coens, to Hanks, Spielberg and so on. The movie looks good, and the actors do a good job.It seems like they tried to make a movie that is a bit more nuanced than good versus evil, where the characters aren't just black or white, but complex moral beings. But it doesn't really succeed. I like the way they explore the act all of the nations has to put up, and how all of them blunders, but do try to avoid war. But at the same time, the movie does not take the time to show the East Germans and the Russians as more than narrow minded. It was a terrible situation, and it should not be excused, but even a big movie like this should try to do justice to the (very real) people who lived back then, on all sides of the conflict. Much like Donovan does, in the movie.The movie is somewhat split into two, and the first part is definitely the best.","

"Bridge of Spies","akcenat","28 January 2016","This film was one of the most anticipated movies of 2015. It's directed by Steven Spielberg, has Tom Hanks in the lead role and has a script written by Joel and Ethan Cohen, but...it's more conversational and seems to be more dialogue intensive rather than any movement or action. Also, the movie is too long for the story and unnecessary baggage of scenes are added. Absence of adequate background score makes many scenes sound boring. Generally, there's not as much tension as one might hope, especially once Hanks is in Berlin, when film becomes slow as we wait for the deal to be brokered.It is OK movie, but that's about it. The film runs for over two hours and is almost nothing but talk, which makes it a bit of dull historical movie. In some ways, it feels like a film for school children. The flick's headlining novelty is Mark Rylance, who plays Abel with mesmerizing performance. Compering to him, Austin Stowell as Powers comes off as the equivalent of actor negative space.

"Bridge of Spies","GusherPop","20 May 2021","It's in the middle of WII, and James B. Donovan is an american lawyer and United States Navy officer in the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the Office of Strategic Services. And he got the case that would change his life and history. Donovan is recruited to defend a russian solviet spy in court (Rudolf Abel). At the same time work with and help the CIA arrange and exchange for the american spy for the soviet spy. The director, Steven Spilberg did an astonishing responsibility making a film that will have an effect on the younger generation, and the older generation. Some rare facts about this film is all the actors were very comfortable with each other. Tom Hanks took the job without reading the script, Powers' son was very concerned about getting the accuracy of the movie right, and Francis Gary Powers wasn't instructed to commit suicide upon capture.The characters in the Bridge of Spies are so well casted, and written, James B. Donovan is such a big and important character because he inspires Rudolf Abel to keep fighting to get back home, and don't give up, and fights for his rights, and freedom's. The characters have a special way of taking and putting a mode into the film and making the words come to life. Everyone deserves a defense. Every person matters. ""Everyone deserves a defense. Every person matters. You're asking me to violate the constitution. I'm an insurance lawyer. I'm not sure I want to pick it up. Everyone will hate me, but I'll lose."" James Dovovan's character really doesn't define what he does, it defines what he does and says, and he doesn't care about the law or the constitution says, he wants to save and get the trade done, no matter what it takes, even if he has to break laws. Most of what Donovan says, and his passion for securing over 9,703 men by July 3, 1963. This really adds to the film because a man or woman that wants to make a change or save a life(s), describes recognition or a movie on them, and respect. Bridge of Spies really shows how much power James Donovan had, and he didn't abuse it, he used it to save over 9,000 women and children from Cuban detention. The film was beautiful casted, Tom Hanks (Sully) , Mark Rylance (The BFG), Joshua Harto (Magnum P. I), Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone), and Alan Alda (M*A*S*H). All the Actors portrayed all the characters so well, I believe that they went through what the characters did.There are so many symbols in this film, The most important one is the handshake at the end, which shows James Dovovan and Rudolf Abel's friendship becoming more than friends, there family now, and over the entire film they get to know each other, and begin to trust each other, and become best friends. The next symbol is the picture of Donovan that Rudolf drew by hand, and he was given the plane back from russia. This shows that Rudolf showed respect and a thank you to Donovan for saving his life, and returning him to his family. The last symbol is the Glienicke bridge, it explains the division between the American government and the Solivet Union, and they have different views, political ideals, and way they treat their citizens.Some eye opening shots in ""Bridge of Spies"" is one of the last scene where they're walking on the Glienicke bridge and it's all dark and all the light is on the ground and the bridge, and it is such a rare shot in any drama I've seen. Another great shot is when Donovan is going to Germany and the Nazis ask for his papers, and the shot is over 2 shoulders and just shows James Donovan's feelings and emotions and speaks a little german.The Theme of Bridge of spies is ""Everyone matters"", James Donovan gets involved because even Soviet spies deserve a fair trial. The main dilemma for him in the spy swap is his determination to rescue not just the high profile, spy plane pilot, but the unimportant student too, and the movie covers issues related to today. Bridge of spies teaches you, everyone matters, even the smallest kid to the smartest person alive they matter. When I watched this film when it came out on October 4,2015. As I watched it, it made me reflect on my life. Did I give everyone a chance, did I respect them, etc.. It made my think so deep, i watched it over and over and over till I got what the movie was trying to teach me which was don't believe what the news, people say about another person, get to know them and ask them there side of the story, and get to know them, and respect them, because you never know how you can change a life if you don't start caring and putting a little love back into the world.","

Mark Rylance has a more challenging role, since Rudolph Abel is given very little back story, but as Donovan slowly warms to this cold enigmatic man, so do we, the audience. The trial scenes are inevitably slow and static, like their equivalents in LINCOLN and AMISTAD, but when events move to Germany this becomes as enthralling as anything else maestro Spielberg has brought us. Berlin in 1961 - a seamless mixture of set and CGI, presumably - is almost the real star of the movie, grim and oppressive: we see the Wall being built and some heart-wrenchingly desperate escapes. BRIDGE OF SPIES is history, with only a little jazzing-up (and some condensing of the time-line), so we know how it's going to end, but Spielberg and Hanks manage to generate terrific tension in the final scenes. This whole picture is a chilling reminder of the darkest period in East-West relations, hopefully never to be repeated.","

"Bridge of Spies","kapelusznik18","9 April 2017","***MILD SPOILERS***True story of the capture conviction and later exchange of Soviet master spy Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance, who was caught in his Brooklyn hotel room by the FBI trying to relay,in a hollowed out US nickel,a secret documents to his Soviet controllers back in 1957. What seemed like an open and shut case of espionage Abel was given insurance lawyer James B. Donovan, Tom Hanks, to represent him to show the world as well as the hated Soviet Union that he was to get a fair trial before he's to be executed or at least sent away for life for his crimes. Donovan really takes his job as well as the US Constatution seriously and defends Abel to the best of his ability only to have his client convicted and given a 30 year sentence which to many Americans seems like a slap on the wrist: That's after the Rosenbergs were executed for the very same crimes that Abel was convicted of some five years earlier.With Abel locked away in federal prison in Georgia and Donoven appealing his conviction US Air Force pilot Francis Gary Powers,Austin Stowell, is shot down with his U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union on of all days May 1-May or Workers Day in the USSR-1960 giving Abel a lifeline for an early out by the US Government who's ready to exchange him for Powers. It was Powers who against orders didn't end up killing himself with a cyanide tipped needle before he was captured by the Russians alive that exposed him as a US spy not a weather man as the US Government claimed he was.With Donovan still Abel's lawyer he's told by his government to negotiate Abel's release in exchange for Powers who's been given a three year sentence, a lot less the Abel was given by the US courts ,behind bars as well as seven years house arrest-In the Moscow Hilton- by the Soviet peoples court. It's with all this going on a love sick American collage student Fred Pryor played by Will Rogers?, not the one you think it is but someone else, is busted by the Communist East German police in trying to get his German girlfriend out of the city of divided Berlin before it's walled up by the East German police as well as military. With the US more then willing to let the totally innocent Pryor hang-by his you know what's- but only wanting to get Powers, who in fact was spying on the USSR, freed Donovan makes it a point to get both Pryor as well as Donovan freed or else he just won't cooperate with his string pullers in both the State Department and Pentagon.***MILD SPOILERS SINCE HISTORY ALREADY SHOWED US WHAT HAPPENED***Donovan prevailed in the end getting both Powers as well as Pryor freed for the return of Rudolf Able in a nail biting exchange on the Berlin Gilenicke Bridge with out as much as a shot, in anger or celebration, being fired. Donvovan who was hated and called a dirty Commie by almost everyone who knew him is now a hero not only by getting Powers and Pryor back but later getting over 9,000 Cuban freedom fighters and their families back to freedom after being captured and arrested by Castro's troops in the disastrous ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion of Communist Cuba in 1961. As for Francis Gary Powers the main man in this movie he never was given the respect that he deserved in him not killing himself before the Commies or Russans captured him thus exposing the entire U-2 spy operations to the world at large. And putting the US, who up until then said it was national policy not to spy on anyone, the self proclaimed ""Good Guys of the Free World"" in a bad light.","

"Bridge of Spies","RossRivero99","27 October 2015","Steven Spielberg's latest film ""Bridge of Spies"" is another great historical masterpiece in his entire film-making career but with this one being much different than the rest, with Schindler's List talking about a very successful businessman at the time who also happened to be a member of the Nazi party who ended up saving 1200 Jews from concentration camps, Saving Private Ryan talking about the D-Day invasion and the casualties on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, Catch Me If You Can talking about the early criminal life of Frank Abagnale Jr., Munich talking about the five men assigned by the Israeli government to eliminate the terrorists responsible for the Black September bombings at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, as well as Lincoln talking about the last few months of Abraham Lincoln's presidency, and now with ""Bridge of Spies"" not only does Spielberg tackle the Cold War but also takes on the subject of communism along with it. The movie stars Tom Hanks (in an Oscar worthy performance) as a Brooklyn insurance lawyer named James Donovan who is told by his boss Thomas Watters (played by Alan Alda) that he was the unanimous choice to defend a Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) whom the majority of Americans want to be hanged but I'm not going to give anything away. After the trial is over the mission of the U-2 spy plane is in effect which it's job is to take pictures of what is going on in the Soviet Union from an altitude of 70,000 feet in the air and the person on that mission is an Air Force Lieutenant named Francis Gary Powers (played by Austin Stowell).After Powers gets arrested and jailed by the Soviets Donovan flies to Berlin to negotiate an exchange between Abel and Powers, soon after a college student majoring in economics gets arrested and immediately ends up being a part of the exchange. Spielberg directed this movie with suspense,passion, and a huge love of country, and not to mention those scenes with Donovan and his wife Mary (played by Amy Ryan) are just heartbreaking. This movie is undoubtedly in my mind the best movie of the year.","

"Bridge of Spies","iquine","14 September 2017","(Flash Review)This movie's story is very linear and straightforward. The story objectives are clear as lawyer Hanks is tasked with negotiating an international exchange of a downed American pilot for a Russian spy while in Germany in the 1950's. Hanks must manage a few negotiation twists and read between the lines to keep and get leverage. The movie highlight must go to the sets and production crew. It looked and felt greatmuch like Munich. Hanks was quality as usual and the editing kept the pacing moving along at a nice clip. The best character was the Russian spy; tremendous performance. The movie could have somehow added more tension or emotion or to help me care for the character's outcomes. Overall, a very solid movie without causing much cognitive effort.","

"Bridge of Spies","Figgy66-915-598470","27 November 2015","27 November 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Bridge of Spies Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks reunite for this tale based on the true events resulting in Gary Powers and his U2 being shot down over the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. America had in their possession a man they believed to be a Russian spy and James B Donovan, an unassuming insurance lawyer was coerced into negotiating the exchange of the two men. This film was pure Spielberg. Extremely well shot using interesting angles to provide menace and intimidation, combined with writing provided by Matt Charman and the amazing Joel and Ethan Cohen, this film had me glued to my seat. It wasn't all action, it was gritty, moving, and in places even amusing. It was also very sobering as we were treated to scenes of the wall being built between East and West Germany and the desperation of people trying to cross before it was completed. The plane spotter part of me was happy to see the U2 being depicted (whether it was real or a model I don't know but it looked pretty good). I could easily watch this again. Superb performance from Tom Hanks and I really liked Mark Rylance, who played the 'Russian Spy' Rudolf Abel, spy or not his performance evoked empathy for the character. It was good to move away from superheroes and disasters for a while and get my teeth into a gritty drama.","

"Bridge of Spies","feakes","25 August 2016","Bridge of spies is based on a true historical event. When Rudolph Abel is caught sending secrets to the Soviet Union and is found out to be a spy Abel needed a lawyer and when no one came forward to do it. One lawyer named James Donovan was appointed. Donovan formerly a criminal lawyer and had served at the Nazi war trials had settled down and became a Insurance lawyer. Donovan doesn't want it. But it becomes clear to him that the case has already been tried and Abel found guilty in a court of public opinion. Donovan decides to do his best to win by any means Legal. This makes him a target in many quarters and unpopular. In an age where anti communist feelings ran high. The case was done in a highly illegal manner and Abel found guilty. Donovan however found a way to save Abel's life by suggesting that he may be useful in the future if say a American Spy had been caught. In this Donovan was smart and foretelling the future because that is what happened. Francis Gary Powers and A young medical student are captured as spies Powers for his failed U2 flight in which he got caught shot down and Pryor for being on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. the U.S. Government wanting to secure the release of both men but not seem involved ask Donovan to work for them but Publicly Donovan works for himself his mission get Powers home. Donovan finds out about Pryor and is determined that Both men come home. Donovan is on his own. no gadgets no tools no back up a lot of handlers watching him and giving him orders which he ignores some he takes seriously but over all he refuses to give up on Powers of Pryor. both men he insists are innocent and are coming home. Alone in a strange country not speaking the language and scared Donovan does the impossible. And that is the movie in every bit of glory. This humble man that would never think of himself as a hero is one. And this man who does the impossible wants one thing to go home and get rid of his cold.This just may be the best spy movie to come out of the last 35 years . and it also is tom Hanks best. Mark Rylance shines as Abel the unworried spy who becomes a pillar of strength to Donovan in the darkest points of the trial. You're not worried Donovan asks him and his reply is a classic No should I be ? would it help if I was ?These are the things movie gold is made of.","

"Bridge of Spies","BeneCumb","29 February 2016","When Spielberg and the Coen Brothers create something together, the result should/could be at least solid and versatile, even if the topic is controversial and/or not bespeaking wide audiences. This was my benchmark when I decided to spend almost 2.5 hours in front of screen; I had some vacillations as the Americans tend to approach European events and characters in a different manner we are used to. Luckily, it was not the case here - European venues seemed authentic, German characters spoke/were German, there was no black-and-white approach regarding ""us vs. them"", etc. And as the plot is based on true characters and events, then realism prevails, and artistic exaggerations just ensure more spirited and dynamic course of events, diminishing aridity usually so characteristic to Cold War spy movies. Thus, the main ideas of justice vs. fairness and legality vs. humanity were skilfully moved to the surface. As for performances, they are good as well, particularly Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan and Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel; unlike many other movies with Hanks' starring, he does not dominate here, he is not evidently ""better"" (= so more famous) than his co-stars. And just today, Mark Rylance obtained his first Academy Award. Congratulations!PS Only last fall, my country experienced a similar event: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Dressen","

Spielberg's directing is top notch, Hanks and Rylance's acting's cutting edge and the Coen's writing adds comedy to a serious film. There are two parts to Bridge of Spies. First part sees Hanks' lawyer defending Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) during the Cold War. In the second part Hanks' James B. Donovan negotiates a prisoner exchange; Abel for a captured American pilot. The coming together of the cast and crew make Bridge of Spies a riveting watch. Tensions are constantly high, even though there's minimal action. The few jokes spread throughout make it no less thrilling. Mark Rylance and Hanks are superb. It's hard to say whether one outdoes the other when they share the screen time.","

"Bridge of Spies","Danusha_Goska","18 October 2015","""Bridge of Spies"" is a big-budget, beautifully produced movie that is unabashedly geared toward thinking adults. There are no nods to fanboys who need to see ""part four"" after a title or a comic book superhero in tights to commit to a film. If you go to movies for fast- paced fight scenes, explosions or strippers, stay home. ""Bridge of Spies"" is an historical drama about the Cold War. It's based on real events. Insurance lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is pressured by colleagues to defend Russian spy Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), who has been caught in 1957 Brooklyn. It's his patriotic duty, they tell him, to provide the accused with counsel, even though the accused is a Russian spy at the height of the Cold War. Donovan does such a good job defending an unappealing client that he is later selected to help negotiate the release of downed U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. No, this isn't the most scintillating of plots. Most scenes consist of men over fifty wearing suits conversing in cagey language and subdued voices about big, big issues. Lavish spending by gifted costumers, set directors and cinematographers is all over the screen. The interior of a middle- class American home in the 1950s-1960s era is beautifully recreated, right down to the divided aluminum foil trays for TV dinners. It would be hard for a male to watch this film and not feel serious fedora envy. Women may yearn for the day when a woman could single-handedly prepare a five course meal for an intact family that eats together in a formal dining room, and yet appear at that dining table looking like a Vogue cover model with cinched waist, pointy assets, firm hair and bright lipstick. And then mom, dad, and the kids hold hands and say grace, and no one looks at their cell phone, or even the TV. They all pay attention to each other. As soon as the camera moves from the United States to East Berlin, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski drains almost all color from his images, the way Dracula drained blood from his victims. The sky is dead white, without clouds or sun, and almost everything you see is the lifeless gray concrete of the Berlin Wall or the charred gray of remaining bombed out buildings. People dress in gray wool; their grim faces are the only vague smudge of color. East Berliners attempting to escape are shot by snipers in watchtowers. It's a totalitarian nightmare. When Donovan enters East Berlin to negotiate Powers' release, he enters an absurd maze of petty manipulations and espionage that would be laughable were it not so deadly. These scenes are reminiscent of the depiction of the state apparatus of petty terror in real Eastern European films like Andrzej Wajda's ""Man of Marble."" Russian actor Mikhail Gorevoy as Ivan Schischkin, a Russian negotiator, is simply a weird and scary looking and sounding man. He wonderfully channels Peter Lorre. We all know, love and trust Hanks so much that there is not as much tension in the film as there ought to be. We know he's going to do the right thing, in spite of every obstacle, temptation, threat or sneer from a stranger on a train who recognizes him from a newspaper photograph. Somehow ""A Man for All Seasons,"" as many times as I've seen it, gives me the sense that maybe, just maybe, this time Paul Scofield's Thomas More will figure out a way to compromise with Henry VIII's demands and not be decapitated. That tension that maybe Donovan will weaken or sell out or be even slightly less than utterly heroic is missing from ""Bridge of Spies."" Spielberg wanted an uncomplicated hero, and he has created one. Mark Rylance gives an amazing performance as Russian spy Rudolph Abel. Rylance is apparently a highly celebrated British stage actor but I'd never heard of him. Rylance does virtually nothing noticeable except tuck his chin into his neck and elevate his eyebrows, yet he is riveting, moving, and memorable. Now that's acting! Abel was just one of the spy's many aliases. His real name was Vilyam ""Willie"" Genrikhovich Fisher. He was of German-Jewish ancestry. Did that play any role in his dedication to Communism? He had lived during the Holocaust. Did Communism offer the only brighter tomorrow in which he could believe? It would have made his life so much better if he had defected to the West, rather than go to prison. Why did he not? The film offers no clue. ""Bridge of Spies"" recreates for the viewer the undercurrent of daily fear during the Cold War. Schoolchildren cry during a school ""duck and cover"" presentation. A boy fills his bathtub with water so as to be prepared for nuclear attack. What was missing for me was what each side offered: an articulation of capitalism v communism. Perhaps the film could have included scenes where Donovan and Abel present their respective systems, their promises and flaws. There are reasons the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, and came down in 1989, reasons that seem to elude the supporters of US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. As it is, there is a marvelous scene where Donovan tells Hoffman, a CIA agent who looks a bit like Bobby Fischer (another pawn in the Cold War) what makes an American an American – the Constitution.","

"Bridge of Spies","RileyOnFilm","26 December 2016","""Bridge of Spies"" is a film directed by Steven Spielberg. For some these days, that may not be persuasive enough to buy a ticket so let me say it is crafted to make a historical event come alive on screen. It stars Tom Hanks but doesn't rely on his huge appeal. Hanks lets the story play out on its own without grandstanding with his character. There's an excellent cast with him and they all work together to make this film amazing.There is so much to enjoy here. It's first of all interesting because it is a true story. Second, it heralds the accused's right to a solid defense. There is much here about negotiations in and out of country. It's also a period piece replete with authentic props and there is a remarkable conclusion one may or may not expect.""Bridge of Spies"" is top notch storytelling about an event that should be remembered from the cold war. A couple questions are addressed:How can people thought of as evil make grand gestures of humanity? Why should we put effort into defending the rights of those such as a foreign spy?There are parts of those questions that require a long telling so the length of the movie may put off some. I was bored at times but I kept regaining interest. If one can keep ones attention span alive between the slower scenes, ""Bridge of Spies"" has many engaging moments and a most intriguing payoff. This is yet another in the sequence of movies I've been reviewing lately that definitely could win movie of the year. It is a story told by Spielberg worth watching.","

"Bridge of Spies","PipAndSqueak","5 December 2015","This is a very creditable attempt at telling the real story of 'Rudolf Abel' and the Cold War shenanigans that happened after the Second World War. Rylance manages to give a slight Scot's accent to Abel who was in fact born near Newcastle Upon Tyne (i.e. he would have spoken with a Geordie dialect). Never mind, Rylance conveys with perfect restraint the imperturbable front any spy worth his salt ought to aspire. This compares starkly with the slightly inept attempt at 'keeping secrets' shown by his American swappee, Powers, when subjected to interrogation. Spielberg manages to apply rose tinted spectacles at strategic points but thankfully, not too detrimentally. Compelling to watch for both Hanks' and Rylance's performances, you may be tempted to find out more about the characters they portray. Nice intro to the history!","

OK, I think my Bridge of Puns is nearly extinguishing you from further reading. But please continue to read for puns' sake. This 1950's true story film adaptation stars the splendiferous Tom Hanks as insurance lawyer James Donovan who inexplicably is delegated to defend arraigned Russian spy Rudolf Abel, exceptionally & subtlety played by Mark Rylance. Donovan is conflicted on defending a Russian spy and all the negative publicity it will receive; and not to mention how it will affect his family. Spielberg once again puts on the genius directorial cap with his intelligent direction of a Steven flick; and there are no bridge of lies with that statement. Another truth you have to handle is that Tom Hanks keeps on putting up strong work; he captivates with his starring performance as Donovan. But it is Rylance here who is the master thespian of the movie, and you can rely on that. Would you want me to add more on the movie? Would it help? But a few tidbits I will add: loved Thomas Newman's score of the picture and the solid screenplay from Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman. That's all I have to say about this movie.

"Bridge of Spies","burlesonjesse5","22 October 2015","Spielberg and Hanks. Hanks and Spielberg. Their collaborations have become legend. You've got 1998's Saving Private Ryan which I never went gaga over. Then there's The Terminal, not an awful film just meh. Finally, we have Catch Me If You Can, the duo's entertaining masterpiece (this is just my opinion). Bridge of Spies (my latest review) is the current synergy between these two celebrated, Hollywood giants. It's cinematic hot chocolate recommendable because of historical significance. ""Bridge"" with its darkly-lit scenes and bloated two hour- plus running time, falls into Steven's two categories of movies being hyperactive, action adventures and historical sagas. It hightails into the latter meaning it's talky, draggy, and mostly devoid of anything compelling. I felt as if I was watching Lincoln again minus the circa range of 1865. Translation: No second viewing for this camper.Taking place during the Cold War via 1957, featuring a cast of virtual unknowns (a Spielberg emblem), and written by none other than the Cohen brothers (Ethan and Joel Cohen of course), Bridge of Spies chronicles real-life insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Hanks). He's a family man, a dude bent on doing the right thing. When he gets saddled with defending a Russian spy (Rudolf Abel played uniquely by Mark Rylance), Donovan helps said spy avoid the death penalty while attempting to trade him for two American refugees (a fighter pilot and a graduate student who are both detained by way of espionage). The flick then involves globetrotting within the territories of Germany, Russia, and you guessed it, Brooklyn, New York. Scenes build to a slow creep combining negotiation dialogue that spews mannerisms at verbatim (Tom's James B. has the flu, we get it). I sensed that I'd been in the theater for ten hours and sat through three drawn-out endings (the final sequence is reminiscent of 1985's White Nights. It looks like a soundstage which is uncharacteristic of the mighty Steven Spielberg).In retrospect, the acting (as expected) is solid with Tom Hanks being well, Tom Hanks. We all know he's the quintessential everyman. Will he get a nomination from the Academy? Maybe but this is October so there's sixty days left in the fiscal year. Bottom line: The World's most socko director provides us with admirable storytelling, technical skill, and period detail of the highest order. Does he entertain the moviegoer in the process? Not entirely. Be sure to bring heightened intelligence and an attention span (the size of Texas) to actually feel immersed. This is a ""bridge"" too far if you ask me. Rating: 3 stars.","

"Bridge of Spies","justinwfirestone","1 February 2016","Why would Stephen Spielberg want to make Bridge of Spies, a Cold War spy thriller, when there's already plenty of better movies out there, like The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, the original Manchurian Candidate, The Lives of Others, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, or even The Third Man? The answer seems that Spielberg is using Bridge of Spies to draw thinly-veiled allusions to the modern War on Terror and enemy combatants, with warnings about xenophobia, government propaganda, and global hyper-nationalism.Bridge of Spies is engrossing and Mark Rylance is especially good as a dispassionate pawn, seemingly apathetic to every part of life and every person, except he has a deep respect for people who get knocked down and stand up again. However, the movie is simply good, not the great movie it wants to be. It lacks the necessary noir and suspense, two aspects hard to achieve in color.We get a legal procedural followed by some low-intensity negotiation and some minor history lessons. Our hero, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), also plays a manipulated pawn, but he has a few tricks up his sleeve because he's compassionate and thoughtful and impervious to propaganda. Information is key, and thus also secrets, so we must keep secrets about lies and lies about secrets (insert modern discussion of cryptography here). Eventually, no one knows who is zooming whom.We have the Rule of Law, which so often breaks down to the Rule of Man, because people write laws and choose whether and how to enforce them. America wants to show off it is better than evil police states, but the lesson here is maybe that's all we do. We simply show off we are better without the actual moral higher ground.Maybe Mario Puzo wrote it best in The Godfather: ""The lawyer with the briefcase can steal more money than the man with the gun.""","

The Russian is so sensitive and human and so is Tom, but everyone else is cold and mean!It's like someone sat down and asked themselves, what are most extreme things we can show happening to evoke as much self-righteous indignation as possible and as much support for our wonderful hero, and then doubled it. I lasted fifty minutes but I can't do any more. Sorry if it gets better after that, but I just couldn't take any more.","

"Bridge of Spies","abouhelier-r","5 December 2015","Bridge of Spies premiered at the latest New-York Film Festival, is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks. I loved this film but I have to admit that going to the movie I did not really know what to expect. You never know with Steven Spielberg; though it's more than likely it will always be a well directed film. However as far as Spielberg is concerned there's two types of well directed historical movie: Saving Private Ryan and Lincoln (that last one is perfectly crafted but if you've seen it once, you'll probably never watch it again). Here, the entire cast is engaging down the line. Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actor. He's genuinely one of the most likable actor in cinema history. This film is his fourth collaboration with Spielberg and once again he nails it.His performance is ultimately Oscar worthy with dry humour and reserve of intelligence that makes his character a man with very particular American ""greatest generation"" characteristics such as modesty, fundamental adherence to core principles he's been raised to value and live by. Hanks plays the movie's voice of conscience, he also can go dark but wasn't built to remain there for too long. Plus, Mark Rylance portrays a Soviet spy: Rudolf Abel with all his contemporary stages actor skills. He's very good bringing fascination and very, very subtle comic touches to a man who has made every effort to appear as bland, even invisible, as possible. Rylance really does a fantastic job, best supporting actor nomination at least.Like I said earlier, most Steven Spielberg's films are consummate entertainments that swipe you up with pure cinema. Bridge of Spies wonderfully comprehensive detailing of 1950's American life in the opening stretches, slides the viewers into the period. This is genuinely one of the best, if not the best, directed movie of the year so far. It's easy to say that because of Spielberg but I can easily see myself rewatching that film. Obviously Tom Hanks' character isn't sent to the Soviet to kill spies, but to negotiate a deal: so there's a lot of talking involved. You may be bored. But if like me you get butterflies in your body when you watch a perfectly crafted scene. When you notice that you've just seen a long wild single take of two people talking with no break, all because of Steven Spielberg brilliance: simulating a close up and mid shot. If this is your jam, you are going to enjoy this film as much as I did. Moreover, you get invested in this non-physical war. A war through words. Spielberg directed it as it was an action movie. He heats up the drama with some action, throws in crowds, chaos and transforms ordinary spaces like a home, an office or a street into battlefields. This film elevates to a new level of intrigue, tension and complexity in its last act and shapes up expertly into a John Le Carré style. Finally, this film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does nowadays. Overall, Bridge of Spies is one of the best Cold-War thriller I've ever seen, a true life espionage tale smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. Masterful old Hollywood style filmmaking.","

"Bridge of Spies","TheExpatriate700","17 October 2015","I did not come to Bridge of Spies with particularly high expectations. Based on the commercials, it looked like an attempt to put a patriotic spin on what was an extremely embarrassing international incident for the United States. However, even though Steven Spielberg brings his usual optimistic outlook to the proceedings, he still crafts a well done film, boosted by an excellent cast and a script by the Coen brothers.Bridge of Spies focuses on the early 1960s prisoner exchange of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel for captured American pilot Francis Gary Powers and graduate student Frederick Pryor. Tom Hanks gives a strong performance as James Donovan, the American lawyer pressured into representing Abel and ultimately negotiating the exchange deal with the Soviets. He is backed by a strong supporting cast, especially Mark Rylance as Abel. Rylance deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the very least.The proceedings are prevented from descending into historical pageantry through a strong, witty script by the Coen Brothers. The serious national security proceedings are permeated with humor, particularly from the deadpan Abel. The script also manages to maintain a certain level of suspense, not a small feat given that we know how the events turned out. At the same time, the film offers important messages about the true nature of patriotism, lessons that are all too needed nowadays since patriotism has been reduced to militaristic fervor.The film does have some notable flaws. At times the pacing is rather slow, and the proceedings may lose the interest those with weaker attention spans. Furthermore, it downplays just how embarrassing the U-2 shoot down was for the United States, particularly after President Eisenhower was caught lying about the U-2 program at a US-Soviet summit. Nevertheless, the film is well worth your time.","

"Bridge of Spies","steiner-sam","14 June 2021","The film is ""inspired by"" events between 1957 and 1962 that culminated in exchanging a Russian spy for an American spy in 1962.In 1957 Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested in New York City by the FBI for spying. This is the middle of the Cold War, and it's only four years after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for giving secrets about nuclear weapons to the Russians. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is an insurance lawyer asked by the American Bar Association to defend Abel. Donovan is noted to have had experience as a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials.Donovan takes the case, defends Abel very well with strict adherence to the rule of law, and resists pleas by the CIA to reveal what Abel has said to him in privileged conversations. He appeals Abel's conviction to the Supreme Court but loses. He does convince the judge to sentence Abel to prison and not execution.Meanwhile, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Sowell) is a fighter pilot who is one of the ""drivers"" for the CIA's U-2 spy plane program. These planes flew at 70,000 feet and were thought to be unreachable by fighter planes and SAM missiles of the day. However, in 1960 he is shot down, captured by the Russians, and convicted of spying.This led to the thought of an exchange. Donovan is asked to do the negotiation in East Germany, not then recognized by the U. S. Donovan had no official status and thus was free to make an effort, but also offered deniability to the U. S. if things didn't work out.So the 140-minute film follows the storyline to the end. There is also an American graduate student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), who gets arrested in East Berlin about the same time. Donovan insists that Pryor be included in the exchange, though the CIA only wants Powers. Donovan's negotiations in East Germany take place while the Berlin wall is being erected. There are many opportunities for the dramatization of events, and Spielberg takes full advantage.Shots are fired at Donovan's home at one point, and he is mugged for his overcoat by some young toughs in East Berlin. Donovan forms a warm relationship with Abel, whom he regards as only doing his country's duty.This is a film dominated by Tom Hanks, and to a lesser extent, by Mark Rylance. Tom Hanks plays the ""everyman"" Tom Hanks; I have no idea if there is any relationship to the real James Donovan. Mark Rylance is a very appealing Rudolf Abel--a quiet little man who likes to paint and serve as part of the conduit of information to Russia, where his family lives.When I see ""inspired by"" (not even the more promising ""based on"" real events), I know the story is mostly fiction. James B. Donovan was a prosecutor at Nuremberg, but he also worked for the OSS for years. He was no simple insurance lawyer. All the violence in the film that Donovan observed actually never happened. Rudolf Abel's major spy work was during and immediately after World War II. He was pretty much a minor cog in the system at the time of his arrest. The U-2 planes had been flying since at least 1958.Most of the events portrayed around Frederic Pryor didn't happen. And on it goes.If you like Tom Hanks, you'll like the film. Mark Rylance does a remarkable job of playing a spy with a fatalistic worldview; I thought he alone was worth watching the film. The FBI and CIA guys are mostly ciphers. The Cold War clichés are milked a bit (""duck and cover""), and reference is made to Donovan's later work negotiating the release of prisoners held by Fidel Castro after the Bay of Pigs disaster. For some reason, the film has received a fair bit of critical acclaim.","

"Bridge of Spies","cdjhood-65924","7 January 2016","Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time with his massive and mostly amazing filmography this was one of my most anticipated movies of 2015 and it lived up to most expectations. Tom hanks is fantastic in this movie he is instantly likable as he is set up from the first scene as an honourable and hard working man. But my god Mark Rylance was outstanding in this movie, he stole every scene he was in and his ""Standing Man"" speech is one of the best monologues of the year. The era of the Cold War was very well done as it was clear how many people hated the soviets in this movie and also made for a lot of very intense moments and gave the impression that things could fall apart at any moment. Like most of Spielberg films Bridge of Spies is superbly directed with most of the scenes are long cuts, tracking shots and close ups. It could have been very easy in a dialogue driven film like to cut a lot but Spielberg doesn't fall for it. This film is not without its flaws, for one Powers' are in this movie was slow and honestly unnecessary as looking back at Savung Private Ryan the person they were trying to save in that movie didn't even make an appearance until 2/3 of the way through and that type of decision would also have worked very well for this movie. The film also suffers from a slow paced second half. With certain obstacles becoming a bit silly and drawn out and being a bit repetitive after a while. The ending however was just perfect for what it needed to be. Not without its flaws but still a great movie and another Spielberg classic. 8.5/10 A-","

"Bridge of Spies","cosmin15","9 May 2023","Quite surprised how mediocre this movie is!Great actors + Spielberg and a flop.Many negatives, I'm afraid...This movie is slow. Really slow. Hence 2h long. A quicker pace would have benefited the movie as a whole and cut it down to standard length.It's a gray movie. Gray upon gray and some more gray. Situation was difficult post WW2 but I find this constant gray unnecessary. It is a spy movie not a concentration camp movie.Actually it's not a spy movie, because nobody is spying anything, it's an attorney/court room movie but unfortunately nobody is doing any attorney work at all and there's no court room debate at all! And that's the main problem with this movie. It's about nothing!It's just people meeting and discussing casually some issues but never diving more than skin deep in the problem, if at all.Maybe you can earn an Oscar for just 10 min play while you say 2 lines, but this was far from it. Springs to mind Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder but Cruise wasn't even credited for his appearance!An interesting story butchered by lack of direction.","

"Bridge of Spies","tonypeacock-1","11 May 2023","I missed this on its release in 2015 so I had pleasure in catching a viewing on the day it was announced in the Best Picture category for the 2016 Oscars.Steven Spielberg directs Tom Hanks as a lawyer (James Donovan) more used to mundane insurance claims than international espionage brinkmanship. However in the late fifties at the height of Cold War tensions between the USA and the USSR he does just that when he is asked to defend an arrested Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance).Donovan is unsuccessful and becomes as hated as Abel in the process! However when US U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers is captured by the Soviets, Donovan leads the negotiations in East Berlin to exchange the pair. Also involved is a young US student who has been unluckily captured by the East German Republic during the Berlin wall construction. I usually dislike Hanks but his performance in this is great. Spielberg has directed historical stories like this before and continues his good track record here.The film moves along at pace. It never drags and keeps you enthralled with the story and East Berlin tensions. The motor vehicles used to recreate the late fifties/early sixties era are great.","

The attention to detail , the charismatic leading man ( Hanks ) and the sentimentality . There's nothing not to like about this film but is that enough to make it great ? Probably not. Although Tom Hanks is excellent I think the standout performance is from Mark Rylance who plays the Russian spy , Rudolf Abel . His understated dour acting is brilliant to watch. If you are expecting an action thriller then you will be disappointed. It's not that type of film. This is pure drama and an enjoyable one at that.

"Bridge of Spies","regula1","16 October 2015","In my mind, there are only two kinds of movie: good and bad. What makes a good movie good depends on a variety of factors that boil down to one thing: does it satisfy the needs of the audience? If you go to an action movie, chances are you go into it expecting many things to blow up and not a bunch of romantic interludes. If you get a lot of booms, then you are satisfied, or if you get a lot of romance, you will probably be dissatisfied.""Bridge of Spies"" is a very satisfying movie.This is not an action film by any stretch of the imagination, mind you. Only three or four booms occur and only a handful of gunshots are seen. This is not a spy film, either. True, the main points of the film centers around two ""spies."" For those not well versed in history, here's the set-up:In 1957, Rudolph Abel, played very simply yet effectively by Mark Rylance, is arrested in New York by the FBI on charges of espionage. Appointed to his defense is Tom Hanks playing James Donovan, an insurance lawyer with a good family struggling to raise his children in the midst of the Cold War atmosphere of paranoia.In 1960, Francis Gary Powers is shot down flying a U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union and is captured alive. In 1961, the Berlin Wall is erected, completely separating East Berlin from West. Finally, in 1962, a prisoner exchange is arranged for Powers and Abel in Berlin, on the Glienicke Bridge, known as ""the bridge of spies.""Donovan is given the unenviable task of defending a self-admitted spy, putting him in a position much like that of John Adams who took the case of the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. Hated by his own people for defending values that everyone in America should value, Hanks' Donovan must wrestle with his morals in the face of people who have bought into their own propaganda and forgotten what is truly at stake.Spielberg puts the values of America at the heart of this movie, but doesn't rub it in your face. On the contrary, through the simple but powerful character interactions and very simple background music, Spielberg lets the audience come to the conclusion for themselves the results of sticking to your values, even when you don't want to, with implications that easily apply today (think Guantanamo.)For those interested in history, the set directors did a wonderful job showing Cold War-era America and Berlin, Berlin especially. It's amazing to think that even 17 years after the end of World War II, East Berlin still had large sections of the city in ruins.Don't look for anything fancy, but don't look at anything at face value. Appreciate the simple yet smart repartee that Hanks shares with characters such as Abel, FBI agents, and Soviet and East German bureaucrats. Reflect on the messages that this film sends in parallel images seen throughout the film. Hopefully, you will come out of the theater feeling ... satisfied.","

"Bridge of Spies","peterp-450-298716","3 February 2016","""I am Irish, you are German. But what makes us Americans? Just one thing, The rulebook. We call it the Constitution and agree to the rules, and that's what makes us American.""Spielberg returns to the history of war long after ""War Horse"", a story of a stallion with a Lassie attitude during WWI, but not with heroic images of the battlefield as in ""Saving Private Ryan"". ""Bridge of Spies"" takes place during the Cold War. A period during which espionage was commonplace and super powers completely distrusted each other. As a result a whole arsenal of nuclear missiles were aiming at the main cities in both continents. Spies infiltrated into society and gave the authorities and agencies all sorts of secret information. And those spies just look like we imagined them. Dignified dressed men with a long coat and a stylish trilby, shyly and cautiously moving through the crowd and revealing a rolled up piece of paper somewhere out of a wall. After that they deciphered this message by means of an ingenious mechanism and a complicated decoding key in their sober furnished apartment. And that message contained the new coordinates where the next message was hidden. Well, in my childhood I imagined it would be like that. The most successful part of this film are the overall eye-catching images and decorations. The setting looks absolutely beautiful with lots of details. The city of New York in the 60s with its boulevards full of beautiful cars, the costumes, the atmosphere and family values in that period. Thus we are introduced to the the family of James Donovan (Tom Hanks). A typical American model family, residing in a house decorated in atom style, elegantly dressed in the fashion of those days and with a disciplined lifestyle. In contrast, a bit later we are witnessing the construction of the Berlin wall that splits this city into two parts. A grim, postwar, snow covered Berlin where heartbreaking scenes take place.Key figure in this espionage drama is James Donovan, an ordinary lawyer who's specialized in legal cases with insurance companies. From one moment to the other he needs to defend the recently arrested Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). In those days anyone or anything that has to do with communism is automatically suspicious and should be condemned immediately. This means that this cold-blooded spy can't count on a fair trial. But they forgot about Donovan, because this principled lawyer convulsively believes in the constitutional rule that everyone, no matter what their crime or origin, is entitled to a defense and isn't guilty until proved otherwise. The result is that the hostile public opinion isn't only focused on Abel but also on Donovan, someone of Irish descent but American at heart.Did ""Bridge of spies"" make a huge impression on me? No not really. Not that the perfectionistic images are disappointing. Or that the acting is abominably bad. But because I wasn't waiting for the umpteenth historical war-documentary. The used clichéd contradictions between the two superpowers was a bit to obvious. For instance, the circumstances of Abel's imprisonment seemed more comfortable than those of the American prisoners in Eastern Europe. And the cunning way Spielberg bypasses the historical character and gives it a more adventurous and heroic touch, shows that he must make concessions to Hollywood's management. On the other hand it was a relief to see that the image of a spy is shown in a realistic way. So don't expect James Bond or Ethan Hunt situations, filled with impetuous action and death-defying stunts while making use of high tech gadgets. The spies in ""Bridge of spies"" are ordinary characters who perform their ""spy-work"" in a simple and less spectacular way.And finally, the importance of a star actor such as Tom Hanks is of course crucial for this film.Hanks is and will always remain one of my favorite actors. A charismatic and versatile actor who turns each role into a masterpiece. He dominates in every movie. Without Hanks this would only be a typical historical drama that has taken shape in the mind of the master himself, Steven Spielberg.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT","

"Bridge of Spies","ethanbresnett","22 February 2021","Spielberg and Hanks, what more could a movie fan want? Individually the two rarely miss the mark with their projects. Stick them together and the results are often sensational. I wouldn't class Bridge of Spies as sensational, but it is a gripping, stylish and engaging thriller nonetheless.The story is remarkable and one that I'm very glad to have learned about. We follow Hanks' lawyer James Donovan as his case to defend an alleged Soviet spy drags him deep into the Cold War. There are some great themes explored, and the performances are exceptional. Hanks is a cut above the rest and delivers his dialogue with such sharpness and wit. Bridge of Spies really is all about the dialogue, which is always excellent. Don't go in expecting an action packed thriller. This is more John le Carre esque, playing out like a game of chess.My only criticisms of this film would be that it never quite reached the heights I was expecting or hoping for. The level of peril always felt quite low. I was hooked don't get me wrong, but the ending felt fairly obvious and as a result there was no great danger or suspense. Then there were the characters. I wasn't that enamoured with any of them. The film was more about the events and how they unfolded, and characterisation and development appeared to take a back seat.Aside from this, everything about Bridge of Spies was great. The direction from Spielberg was expectedly fantastic, Hanks was so magnetic and watchable, and the score, sets and costumes set a brilliant tone and style for the film.Very enjoyable and most definitely worth a watch.","

"Bridge of Spies","phatdan","26 October 2015","Propaganda plays out in this latest Spielberg effort. At the start we see a Russian spy arrested by the FBI. He is a most pleasant fellow played by Mark Rylance. Evidently typecast for the part, he is as soft- spoken and sincere as he was in 'Angels and Insects'. With a pleasant, Scottish brogue, he exhibits a spy with profound integrity. The depiction of the American response to his escaping the death penalty is embarrassingly sophomoric (Actually, as I can remember as a teenager, there was little or no public outcry at the sentence). The incompetence of American military intelligence is also depicted (70,000 ft wasn't high enough for the U-2 spy plane to avert being shot down). But military incompetence has always been an easy target, especially to a liberally biased Hollywood. Nonetheless, it is well-crafted and enjoyable. And, propaganda evens out as we see the Berlin Wall erected, and the consequent brutality of Soviet tyranny.","

"Bridge of Spies","steven_torrey","6 December 2015","I'm 70 and I seem recall as a kid at least once getting under my desk to protect us from nuclear bombs. But I think only once. Too young to know of Russian Spy Rudolf Abel; but I clearly remember Gary Powers U-2 incident and the subsequent exchange of Abel and Powers.I thought the drama taut, well crafted, suspenseful. Interesting characterization of Abel (Mark Rylance) and Donovan (Tom Hanks). (I refuse to say 'great acting'--that is why they get paid millions.) The film conveyed the greyness of those years--the greyness not only in America but in East Berlin. The sense of being slightly depressed about something--though in East Berlin there was lots to be depressed about.Donovan challenges Abel, he challenges the court case, he challenges the CIA, the US Military, the East German thugs, the East German politburo. And in the end--he gets the release of not only Gary Powers but an American economics student--Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers)-- who got himself captured when he crossed into East Berlin. And crossing into East Berlin should not be seen as some easy cross the border jaunt; it was fraught with peril of being arrested as a spy on trumped up charges and incarcerated and interrogated mercilessly for any length of time. So Donovan crossing into East Berlin took huge guts and risks.I was never certain of who or what Wolfgang Vogel (Sebastian Koch) was--was he an embassy functionary or an East German Communist Party Apparatchik? In the end, he clearly was not to be trusted.Rudolf Abel was a Russian Spy and in the movie he aids Donovan or tolerates Donovan in being certain that Pryor is released as well as Powers--something the Russians agreed to by releasing Pryor at Checkpoint Charlie while Powers and Abel are exchanged at the Glienicke Bridge.While in the movie, Donovan is portrayed as an insurance attorney recruited for Abel's criminal defense, and later recruited by the CIA Allen Dulles for the prisoner exchange, the film neglects to mention that he was also employed during the war in the OSS (precursor to the CIA). So his experience in the world of espionage was recognized and justifies choice for him in these sensitive assignments. So when he goes to Judge Mortimer W. Byers ((Dakin Matthews) to request Abel be sentenced to time in prison because the US may need him for tactical negotiation for a future potential prisoner exchange, he is working from some insight into the world of espionage. The film fails to make Donovan's relationship to this world of espionage clear.There was a sort of Walter Mitty moment in the movie, when at the end, his family learns from the television news that Donovan was in reality a special Envoy to President Kennedy in a top secret mission. How cool is that: every child wants their father to be a secret agent in reality. It was just one light touch among several that gave the spy thriller an added dimension.For escapist drama but well grounded in reality, it was really a great movie--well worth the time. And apparently the film hews pretty closely to actual events--given the inevitable need for film drama.","

"Bridge of Spies","Yelitza-screenwriting-student","25 October 2015","Loved this film!The title is actually literal! It's all revealed in the last sequences of the film. Wonderful impact! But watch carefully seeds are planted at the very beginning of the film to guide your mind into the end. The pace of the film is perfect – no time for boredom, and enough time for exposition to understand what's going on and keep the suspense. Some apparent loose strings come together at the end—it all makes sense and it's wonderful.The world building is realistic: Spielberg shows us the destruction of East Germany, the horrors of the wall, and the economic and social devastation. Of course Spielberg is a superstar in this territory—he's done war masterpiece films before. He knows how to compose images that stir curiosity and deep emotions. The writers did a superb job with a sequence of scenes that makes us (the audience) care very much for Jim (Tom Hanks) and his missions. We understand him. We want him to succeed: he's a man of altruism, honor, generosity, and justice. He's a warm and kind husband, father, and citizen. He sacrifices his reputation. And he's so smart! He uses his knowledge in probabilistic insurance models to make decisions on his spy negotiations. Brilliant.When Jim says that the Russian spy should be given incarceration and not electric chair because he could be used for an exchange, in case the Russians get an American spy this gave me the hint of what was coming later. Even though there's some predictability, the whole situation of an American lawyer in treacherous enemy territory to hold negotiations is incredibly suspenseful.I was on the edge of my seat I laughed with Tom Hanks mannerisms and sense of humor (his trademark shouts and gestures) in rough times. I got teary in the last sequence of the exchange, and how Jim's kindness won the Russian's spy's heart.Tom Hanks is the master of showing emotional engagement and astute acting. He is a delight to watch on the big screen. The rest of the cast does a fine job and thanks to them the best and the worst of Jim's character shows up on the screen. Conflict and suspense are part of every minute of this film! Jim took measured risks—for the sake of doing the right thing—and he succeeded. Wonderful 2 hours! Loved it!I was super surprised to see the energetic sequence of the airplane taken down by a Russian missile! An unexpected exciting moment of action and thrill! Because of this event, at midpoint in the film things flip upside down for Jim – he has to go to East Berlin to negotiate 1 for 1 exchange, but while he is there, he learns there's a student that happened to be at the wrong time and got captured and he makes it a 2 for 1which becomes an incredible difficult and dangerous task This is a masterpiece to be absorbed and relived many times. Cheers.","

"Bridge of Spies","mgumsley","4 December 2015","Tom Hanks has found it difficult to replicate the kind of performance he produced for Forrest Gump, here he effortlessly matches it with his subtle portrayal of a lawyer who is cast adrift with a case that makes a pariah of him, but sends him on a relentless journey for the truth.Hanks, the perennial good guy epitomises all that is good in America at a time when it poisoned itself with Cold War fears. He defends a spy who is, well, a spy and finds he is defending a man who is as honourable as he is inscrutable. Because he is a man who is determined to make an honest job of a thankless situation, he finds himself drawn to his client and defends him to the bitter end.The plot is clearly drawn by wonderful writing from the Coen brothers, and the subplot of American spying closely following the case until the inevitable climax involving an exchange of spies is realistically told with spellbinding cinematography. Mark Rylance comes of age as a regular on the big screen and makes a convincing foil for the more eloquent Hanks.

"Bridge of Spies","lucasversantvoort","14 December 2015","Spielberg's been more and more interested in 'true stories' lately, what with him directing War Horse, Lincoln and so on. The same goes for Bridge of Spies, the story of how one insurance lawyer managed to negotiate the exchange between a Soviet spy and an American army pilot in East Berlin during the Cold War. Spielberg, armed with a script co-written by--of all people--the Coen brothers (oh ya betcha, yaaa!), manages to bring this piece of history to life, as a film about history should.1957. A Russian spy, Abel (Mark Rylance), is arrested in New York. James Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer is brought on to defend him. But, he is told, it's basically a farce, since everyone and their mother wants to see this guy hang. The trial is merely to show the world he was treated fairly. Donovan takes his duties seriously, however, and defends Abel to the best of his abilities, to the dismay of pretty much the entire populace. During this time, his relationship with Abel seems to develop into a strange friendship, a sort of mutual understanding despite their differences. The judge presiding over the case wants to see Abel found guilty as much as anyone, but Donovan manages to persuade him to sentence him to jail rather than the chair. At this point, the film's second half begins. An American pilot on a top-secret mission is shot down and captured by the Russians and the CIA asks for Donovan's help in arranging the exchange: Abel for the pilot. Donovan travels to East Berlin, around the time the Berlin Wall was being built, to meet with the Russians, to have the conversations their governments can't.What I found most appealing is something that is ironically also probably the source of that Spielberg-ian sense of Americana: James Donovan's sense of honor. James and Abel find each other in a way. They value each other's sense of honor and duty. Donovan argues in court that America should behave according to its own well-established rules, even during wartime, otherwise you're also dismissing the Constitution and how could you possibly represent American and all it stands for if you do that? Spielberg must have felt Donovan's message was relevant today. Then again, whenever we see Abel being fairly treated in prison (the way Donovan would've wanted), it's immediately contrasted with how the American pilot is harshly interrogated in Russia, so there's also a righteous America vs brutal Russia undertone, perhaps referring to how the Russia of today is fairing under Putin. Maybe both meanings apply simultaneously, with Spielberg urging humane behavior from both world powers.If there's one thing the film doesn't sell well, it's the family scenes. Amy Ryan gets the unfortunate role of the nagging wife. That's selling her a bit short, but every time we see her, she's worried about Donovan, the family, the way society perceives them. That's her primary emotion: worry. And what about the son? There was not a single scene where I believed I was watching a father-son relationship. I get that he symbolizes the poisonous influence of those prepare-yourself-against-the-Russians video's from the fifties, but how am I supposed to take him seriously when their house is fired upon and they first thing this kid does is eagerly say he followed the correct procedure in case the Russians attacked them? If they wanted to increase the emotional stakes with the family scenes, well, they failed miserably.Another (minor) complaint is the build-up to Francis Gary Powers' plane crash. It's just technical stuff we learn here. We're not becoming emotionally attached to Francis at all. Therefore, the only tense part of his inevitable capture is the CGI-ridden crash itself. You introduced the student only minutes before his capture, so why does the pilot deserve all this endless build-up? Either do a build-up like this right, or let it end up on the cutting room floor. The film's long enough as it is.Overall though, the film's quite good. The drama is never overbearing, the film manages to infuse the proceedings with a sense of humor that essentially ridicules this strange part of history (perhaps à la Strangelove) and, even with what I consider some superfluous scenes, it's wonderfully paced. Definitely not a bridge too far.",NA
"Bridge of Spies","DHWaldron","11 November 2017","Bridge of Spies stars Tom Hanks as the real-life lawyer James B. Donovan, who must defend the captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, who has directed and produced many war-time films (such as Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Schindler's List) he sets this film during the bleak conditions of the Cold War, just as the Berlin War completes construction.Bridge of Spies employs fantastic acting from all cast members, especially Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, who emit a strong yet realistic sense of camaraderie and friendship due to their, at first, mutual relationship which develops into a bond so tight that the audience doesn't want it to be broken. The film also manages to contrast image and words, which work brilliantly, such as every scene where Tom Hanks is on a train, where no words are spoken, but one hundred ideas are broadcasted via the strong emotional face of Tom Hanks. These Grade-A performances as well as the completely differing settings of the two halves of the film, perfectly execute the mood integral for this serious, often heart-tugging moments. As mentioned, the scenery is gorgeous, with frequent switches of location; from America to Berlin and back, the location/cinematography greatly enhances the atmosphere of this film as do the uncoverings of background characters emotions and feelings towards Hanks' character such as a random policeman he meets, all questioning him: ""Why are you defending that traitor?"", revealing to the audience the side some must take for their country.Overall, the film is magnificent with perfect performances, a contrasting climate (from sun to snow) and the nuanced characters makes Bridge of Spies a fantastic film with strong underlying morals and values which still apply to this day.",NA
"Bridge of Spies","ALSHEHRI_A10","26 January 2021","Tom Hanks, how awesome you are, you deserve an Oscar.
Mark Rylance, yes, you are the Oscar.There are two scenes for two different walls
A safe and stable homeland, and another broken and dividedLet's put a question:
Is there a fair trial for the spy?
The answer:
Anyone deserves to be defended, because anyone's life matters
And anyone deserves decent treatment as a human being.(Law is the only means of justice for human beings, and for preserving their humanity).When the world tightens and you are surrounded by the sharp and critical gazes of people, just because you are a doer of principle that you see from your point of view that nothing disgraces your position, will you remain steadfast in your position even if this position costs you the security of your family or contempt for your neighbors, or will you swim with the current and submit to the pressures of your society ..Do what you think is right without looking at the considerations made by others. It takes two kinds of boldness, the first is your boldness necessary to make a decision, and the second is your boldness necessary to take responsibility for your decisions.",NA
"Bridge of Spies","krocheav","20 October 2016","Although very good to look at and mostly continually interesting (while maybe a little over length) this bridge may not hold as much weight as it could have. I suppose we should know what we can expect with Spielberg at the helm. While I agree this is one of his better movies, it still offers the usual over exaggerated bits just to liven up the action - while some facts get overlooked for the sake of 'entertainment'.We don't get to know anything about the character the whole show is built around - not even what his bit of folded paper was all about, so have to assume this was perhaps mocked-up to hold our interest. Mr Hank's wife is just a bit too difficult to believe - especially her reaction after their home and family get shot up!- then again, with that whole segment being a fabricated beat-up (this looks like Cohen Bros stuff) I guess it also fits in with the way Hollywood saw 50's women. It's mostly good based on fact dramatic entertainment with an element of fanciful trimmings - what more could be expected of a Spielberg/Cohen partnership?. Another positive comes in the way Award winner Marc Rylance as Abel (the spy) and Tom Hanks as his defense, perfectly bounce words and glances off each other.",NA
"Bridge of Spies","leftbanker-1","20 April 2021","Tom Hanks was perfect for this role as a sort of avuncular action hero whose superpower is decency and common sense. The Soviet spy was portrayed as a highly honorable man who believed in his cause and was willing to die for it. Powers, on the other hand, was a pawn in the American intelligence apparatus without the proper training to fend off even the mildest sort of interrogation. U. S. Aircrews have been receiving much better training since.I have to say that I'm not a huge Spielberg fan (please don't tell him that, I don't want to hurt his feelings), but he took what could have been a really dry and boring page of history and turned it into a fine movie.Almost 60 years later in 2021, we still have our Russia problem. We can only hope the our new President, Joe Biden, will play the role of Tom Hanks and deal with the Russian oligarch Vladimir Putin with the same sort of no nonsense determination. Trump wanted Putin to be his friend. Putin is not our friend.",NA

"Bridge of Spies","rjsf96","2 January 2016","Steven Spielberg is one of Hollywood's most prolific Directors. He does not have the best track record and yet he creates far more great films than poor ones. It will come as little of a shock then that Bridge of Spies is a great film, with Spielberg on fine form, showcasing tremendous showmanship, craft and talent. Bridge of Spies bears the distinction of being his best film since Saving Private Ryan, so applause in this case is necessary.Based on a true story, Bridge of Spies is set in the fifties in America, during the time of the Cold War. James B Donovan works as a lawyer, but soon the CIA involves him with a suspected Soviet Spy by the name of Rudolf Abel. They ask Donovan to help Abel out in court. What they really mean is to make the proceedings look civilised and yet they all know that Abel does not have a hope in hell. That is until Donovan is willing to truly help him.What Bridge of Spies has really got going for it is an element of intrigue as well as a dash of surprise and suspense. How often is it that we get a film set in the fifties with the amount of drama, wit and excitement that Director Steven Spielberg and writers Joel and Ethan Coen can stir up in us? It's rare for a match between material, writers and director that is quite literally made in heaven. With Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance at the helm, Bridge of Spies is exceedingly well acted and I am not a loyal devotee of Hanks, but here oh my goodness how he shines like never before! His character has heart, warmth and humour. The most important aspects in making us love a character. He is not once misjudged. Thank the marvellous writing from the Coen Brothers for that one!Still considering the talent involved when you have the Coens on board, in all honesty I wanted Bridge of Spies to be a greater film than it actually amounts to. But don't get me wrong this is terrific film making. Yet there's something lacking. What is it? A sense of flowing momentum and precision. Which is all to do with the script. At first glance there's no problem to be had here. Yet upon further scrutiny it does not hold up. My main issue? We are shown scenes that do not need to be seen. They detract from the thrust of the story. We almost forget about Donovan and that's a crime itself. Luckily it's only for ten minutes at a time, but I must admit that these departures from the essence and heart of the story do hurt the film. It's also too long for its own good and I strongly suspect that Spielberg inflated the runtime so that the Academy would pay more attention to the film during awards season. The gamble does not pay off.But let's not get negative here. Bridge of Spies is no question or doubt in my mind an excellent film. Not perfect alas. But brilliant all the same. If anything its further proof that Steven Spielberg is the best at what he does in the business. Particularly if the subject matter is a) A Biopic b) centred around a well-drawn individual and c) about courage in the hardest to find places. Spielberg don't ever stop making movies while I'm around.B+",NA
"Bridge of Spies","antoniotierno","27 December 2015","A Cold War thriller starring a Tom Hanks seeming inexplicable. Steven Spielberg's technique is to pack intrigue and movement into every shot, to fill his characters and story with fidelity to the era's realpolitik. It's a movie without much glamor and it's enjoyable though there's no impetus or pace. Spielberg can't animate a Coen brothers script combining espionage and court room. 141 minutes is an excessive runtime but the story successfully bets the house on the interplay between an all-American archetype and a reserved but fragile traitor looking like a bank clerk. All these characters are perfect and that's enough in a film built on legal conversation.",NA
"Bridge of Spies","tyingling7766","27 February 2017","Bridge of Spies. I hate that I waited so long to see this movie. It is so amazing. Stick around and see how so.Synopsis: In the cold war, a lawyer, James B. Donovan is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers. The pilot was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission and stays in the company of a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel, who was arrested for espionage in the US. Starring: Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance Director: Steven SpielbergFirst thing is, there is hardly anything wrong with this movie. The only downfall is the fact that it ran two minutes longer than it should have. Just a mere two minutes was the matter of this movie being a 10 or a 9. Throughout Tom Hanks' character's whole time in Germany he was saying all he wanted to do was get home to his bed. When that happened at the end of the movie it should have just ended there. There was no need to show that people respected his character after he got back. Falling onto his bed and going to sleep was enough in my opinion.Now that we got the one bad thing out of the way, let's talk about the best thing of the movie. Mark Rylance did deserve the best supporting actor for his role. He was so amazing in this movie. Was he a spy or not? Yes, the truth has come out and he was a spy, but nobody knew that at the time. The way Rylance played it off as if you couldn't tell was superb. If he see this movie for anything watch it for Rylance's performance.Tom Hanks in this movie was as amazing as he always is. Well, after he stopped doing those romance movies. And outside the two I have mentioned, there was no one who stood out. That's okay. The whole situation was about how Donovan treated Abel respectfully and worked over the Russians and Germans to get what the U.S. needed.Unlike a lot of Spielberg's movies in the last twenty years this one did not have a pacing problem. Even though it was nearly two and a half hours long it didn't feel that way. You are so entranced in the story that you don't realize you were sitting there for two hours and then the movie is over.How this movie didn't win more awards is beyond me. It was so good. This is one of those movies that will stand the test of time. I guarantee it. Watch it.Rating: 9 out of 10",NA
"Bridge of Spies","proud_luddite","2 September 2018","Based on a true story: In 1957, James Donovan (played by Tom Hanks) is a partner in a Brooklyn law firm who deals mostly in insurance claims. After he is assigned to defend a convicted Soviet spy, his life and mission are changed entirely.Director Steven Spielberg succeeds in evoking earlier periods: Brooklyn in 1957 and Berlin in 1962. The physical atmosphere has a mood of its own in each city. These evocations are well aided by the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski.The beginning is rather good but is occasionally predictable even to those of us not aware of the historical events. Donovan also seems too earnest and we don't fully get why he would be this way considering the danger his convictions place upon him and his family.The middle of the film successfully portrays the bleakness of Berlin as the infamous wall is being built; but it tends to sag and seem overlong.The final scene, which takes place in the titular location, lifts everything to make the film worthwhile. The bleak winter night is made even harsher as the tension and suspense reach their heights. Here, Spielberg shows once again what makes him great.There may be an overall message: that countries with good laws must maintain those good laws to stay great, even when such countries are being threatened. This principle could still be a source of today's discussions about similar situations..",NA
"Bridge of Spies","vistheindian","30 November 2015","Quickie Review:When a Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in the height of the Cold War is arrested, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend him in an American trial. Meanwhile an American pilot is captured by the Soviets, thrusting Donovan into the responsibility of negotiating between two world powers on the brink of war. Bridge of Spies, balances the gravity of politics on a world stage with the relations and fears of the people behind it all. This film is yet another great example of what Spielberg and Hanks can achieve when they team up together. Will this be a classic from years to come? I expect not, but the quality of acting and directing is undeniable.Full Review:Considering Spielberg being one of the best directors and Hanks being one of the best actors in the Hollywood business, it is hard not to get excited for this movie. I'm not completely familiar with the real-world story, so I can't say much on the accuracy but on the movie of course I have my opinion to share.In terms of the performances, everybody was flawless but the clear stand-outs for me was Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. The character Donovan is unwavering when it comes to his duty as a lawyer, even when he has to defend an enemy of his country. He believes in the importance of unbiased justice, so strongly that at first it may come off as naïve. However, there are understated moments where we can see clearly his resolve being tested to the limits. Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy, is a man of few words but with that limitation he is able to convey so much about the character. He is defeated and fearful for his life, but when Donovan shows that there is still hope he will crack a joke. The key here is subtlety, that brings the power into the more dramatic moments without it feeling forced. I didn't feel like I was watching actors, I felt like I was watching real people.Another aspect that really grabbed my attention is the Cold War setting. It is of course the perfect time period for any political thriller story (a real one at that). Despite it being decades ago, it is hard not to see the parallels between the Cold War era and present day. We get to see the xenophobia in USA surrounding communists and Soviet spies, people quick to draw conclusions from their emotion. Could we really say things are any different now? Unfortunately not. So it is interesting how the movie feels relevant in modern day politics. The second half of the movie shows the delicate nature of negotiations. There are moments of manipulations, lies, and deceit. Yet through all that a trust has to be built to have any movement in the talks. How the characters try to build that relation for mutual benefit is what intrigued me the most.I only have one complain, that is it feels like two movies in one. The first half feels like legal drama, and the second half is a political thriller. So I would've liked more consistency between the two plot lines. Bridge of Spies, in the end achieves the authenticity in its characters and the setting. That's why I highly recommend seeing this movie. Personally, movies (not documentaries) that are based on real stories should prioritise authenticity and not accuracy. That I think are two very different things that deserves a whole entire post to explain.",NA
"Bridge of Spies","Equalizer16","12 December 2015","There so much history we don't learn till, many years later, lie I didn't know that Tom Hanks was an American hero.Bridge of Spies follows the acts of an American lawyer who is tasked with defending a soviet spy, but leading him to become the key to peace between two nations. Tom Hanks stars as the brilliantly smart, wise, and very likable character while trying to do the best that he can for his country and relations with the Soviet Union, he becomes caught in a moving tale of an eye for eye, and doing the morally right thing, no matter what is safe.Honestly though, the film took a while to get going for me, as the film mainly consist of men in suits talking and drinking, along with some brilliant dramatic music. However, when we come to the main plot of this exchange in Berlin, the film pulls you in, and now you never want to fall asleep. Even if the event is known to you, you are feeling the suspense.You also get a real life feel of what it was like during the cold war and the tension between the USA and Soviet Union, which makes it a powerful film. This pulls the audience into the time and place, and you get strong emotional reaction in some scenes.I wouldn't say though that the film is unique, I think the story definitely so, but the film is one I've seen a few times.That being said the best part is the final Bridge scene, which really gets you on the edge, not just for suspense but also in pride, and emotion. This was a unique scene for me.Bridge of Spies is a strong 8/10, and is definitely in my list of nominations at the Oscars.",NA
