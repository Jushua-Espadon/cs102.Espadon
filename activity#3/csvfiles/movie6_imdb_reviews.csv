"Iron Man","TheLittleSongbird","12 August 2014","When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"Iron Man","SnoopyStyle","7 December 2013","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a hard playing billionaire genius. He is captured in Afghanistan after demonstrating his newest weapon. He is forced to create new weapons for his captor. Instead he makes an armored suit to escape. He also makes an arc reactor to keep his heart going and shrapnel from killing him. Once back in the States, he moves his company to concentrate on arc reactor technology and stop weapons manufacturing.This is all RDJ. He and he alone makes Iron Man work. It's doubtful if anybody could have done it better. It's certain that he's made it next to impossible to replace him. Director Jon Favreau has built around him the dazzling array of tech fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow as his Girl Friday. It is RDJ's fast talking, quick wit, and personal history that makes him the perfect Tony Stark. Great character, fun movie.","

"Iron Man","bjoernidler","7 October 2018","In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: 
Is Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.","

"Iron Man","repojack","7 February 2021","MCU 2021 MarathonMCU #1:Iron Man was my favorite Marvel hero. As a teen I collected 1-150 with the main series. I doodled the Iron Man helmet during class at high school when bored.So it was a huge surprise when this came out in 2008 and it was so freaking GOOD! Jon Favreau, the guy that had done Elf and Zathura (the Zumanji sequel) had just started a cinematic revolution? What!?!? (And Favreau is doing it again with The Mandalorian).Robert Downey Jr. was made for the part of Tony Stark. The origin story was modernized and handled well. They included most of the early Iron Man suits from the comics. They took the time showing the more modern invention of the suit and the challenges of making it work (e.g. maneuvering with the repulsors).I finally understood what Spiderman's fans felt like when Sam Raimi's Spiderman series became a massive pop culture sensation years earlier. Fantastic!There are issues. Pacing mostly. Jeff Bridges is too much the stereotypical villain with an over-the-top fight scene at the end.This was the beginning of the MCU world building effort which was more ""slight-of-hand"" in the earlier movies -- Stark's OCD making itself evident, that Shield guy at the party, and Samuel Jackson pinging Stark about Avengers in the end credits.It began and ended with Iron Man. That makes me happy.""I am Iron Man""","

"Iron Man","jhudson-11704","27 July 2017","With a B-list superhero, a risky lead actor, a genre that hasn't really done much other than say Nolan's Batman, this movie had a lot to prove. Wow, did it ever. It proved that superhero movies can be realistic, emotional, funny and have highly entertaining action. This is the movie to launch the MCU, and started the shared universe that DC comics and other franchises are following.Let's start with the number one reason why this movie is so good: Robert Downey Jr. I am so glad that Jon Favreau kept pressing the studio to make sure RDJ had this role because he completely nails it. He effortlessly portrays the cool, sarcastic, alcoholic, playboy that I don't even think he's acting. He's clearly not perfect as he is the guy we think is awesome but don't necessarily want to be. This role is basically synonymous with RDJ now because you can't think of Tony Stark without immediately thinking of RDJ. Iron Man wasn't a househeld name before but thanks to RDJ's performance, it is now.The action in this movie is incredible as you get to see him fly around, take on terrorist cells and fight the main villain. What I even found to more intriguing is Stark's entire time building his suit, both in the Afghan cave and in his garage because it is amazing to see his genius at work, while still being snarky and basically a tool.The writing and humor is also very good in this movie. I read that a lot of the lines, especially RDJ's were improv, which is able to keep this movie very fresh, not Rotten Tomatoes style, but it helps a lot by breaking the molds of superhero movies.A couple complaints in this film is the pacing and the final villain. The pacing starts off very well, not really rushing into him being Iron Man, establishing his character very well before his abilities. Then the final battle comes around and it's basically just an evil version of his character, which sort of works with the problem of his technology getting into wrong hands, but the fact that it's just fighting a mirror is kind of boring. The final battle comes around pretty quick and it resolved fairly quick as if they are trying to wrap it up really quickly. I did like Bridges' Obadiah Stane with his intimidating yet charming persona but in the end he was just a reverse of Iron Man, not that interesting.+ Robert Downey Jr + Fresh, new start for superhero movies + Writing and pacing (mostly) + Action and Humor - Final Villain Final Score: 9.3/10","

"Iron Man","planktonrules","12 April 2009","I finally saw this movie last night on DVD. Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office, I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it, but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already, mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead, let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also, I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally, while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film, it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog, but the end was all special effects. Still, I must admit that they were very, very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character ""Pepper Potts"" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular, Graham Chapman, coined the term ""Pepperpot"" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged ""ladies"".UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance, the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film.","

"Iron Man","jaredmobarak","29 April 2008","There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flicklet's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out backstory. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, ""no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can."" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liason, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show ""Dinner for Five"" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the backstory and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years.","

"Iron Man","Smells_Like_Cheese","2 May 2008","Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.Tony Stark, rich, handsome, incredibly wealthy, has it all. He also creates war weapons, when he goes to Afghanastan to introduce a new missile, he is captured and told to create the missile for the terrorists. But Tony has other plans, he creates a metal suit and escapes, he goes back home and announces that he wants to retire and close down Stark industries due to the violence he saw. But when he learns that the weapons of his are in the wrong hands, he realizes that maybe he could re-create a metal suit and become Iron Man, the incredible machine to save man kind.Iron Man is a sure fire hit that I'm sure you won't want to miss. It has everything you could want for a comic book film: action, humor, a great cast, romance, and ultimate effects that just get you excited. Even the soundtrack gets you pumped up and ready to root for Iron Man. The only complaint, as much as the action was cool, I wish it wasn't the war on terrorism they used, I know it's part of the story, but it hits so close, that it may seem inappropriate. The climax, a little cliff hanger, but I'm already smelling a sequel for next year probably. But Iron Man is a fun movie that all ages could enjoy, Iron Man is the new Spider Man for 2008! 8/10","

"Iron Man","DICK STEEL","30 April 2008","With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.This may irk the fervent fans of Iron Man, but face it, the superhero belonged to Tier B where superheroes are concerned, languishing behind easily recognizable peers who already have movie after movie being made. But thanks to the advancement in digital technology, bringing Iron Man to life no longer consisted of the prospect and worrying thought of having a man running about in a rubber suit passing it off as metal, the way Ultraman would have been done, complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and fool the visual sensory. Here, we have a very detailed rendering of the entire design from scratch to final modification, and we're in at every step of the way, with many cheeky and sometimes a tad implausible scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in.I thought Iron Man the story worked because of stark (pardon the pun) similarities with Batman Begins, also an origin story which took its time to dwell on the man behind the suit, nevermind at the sacrifice of having less action sequences, or by not giving the fans what they want through the showcase of more than the basic powers. Advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel, and as the first movie used to establish its characters, I felt that it succeeded, given too that it had a cast of capables (just like Batman Begins had) to pull the movie through without resorting to over the top and campy performances, starting of course with the lead in Robert Downey Jr.In a nutshell, Downey is Tony Stark through and through. His affinity for the character shines, and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own personal, and Stark's life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle. He was allowed to become a Two-Face of sorts, on one hand being and later acting out his flamboyance self whose mission in life was the continuation of his father's legacy of Stark Industries, a weapons conglomerate, versus his personal mission in ridding his own weapons from the hands of the bad guys, now updated to be freedom fighters in the Middle East. The dialogue contained within each scene of Stark's, except perhaps during captivity, is full of one-liners done in double quick time, you probably would think it boiled down to a whole host of natural ad-libbing.But while Starks spends significant amount of time in his unsecured basement building his masterpiece, his human interaction come in the form of faithful secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who actually, for the first time I admit, looked really good on screen as Stark's most trusted aide, bringing about some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the two characters of opposite sex, more so than any other comic book movie I have seen. And good friend from the air force Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) complete the circle of trust who knows of Stark's secret identity, and you'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the toss of a teaser of a certain War Machine appearance should the sequel be out. Who's the main villain in the movie? It points the finger at Corporations, or at least here, the weapons manufacturers and the shady deals that go through in the name of profit, the sole objective for any corporation's existence. And Jeff Bridges, in a rare villainous role, got to personify that greed and wrestle for absolute power just like the trailer already suggested. While his performance is refreshing as he disappears behind the ball head and bushy beard, you could see his motivation and how the plot would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for Iron Man to duke it out in a, sad to say, ordinary finale which any audience would probably be able to stay a step ahead.As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of similarities with the Dark Knight of Gotham in Christopher Nolan's reboot, but more so because of properties inherent with the likeness between Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day job to pursue their ""hobby"", both have to suffer personal tragedies in order to wake up to the cruel world, and in the movie, both fall prey to the corporate raider type, spend time perfecting their suit of war, have assistants they would trust their lives with, and of course save them from impending doom, and a finales set at their facilities.But Iron Man is still a special effects extravaganza offering a thrill ride especially when he goes into battle mode, and without a doubt, Robert Downey Jr probably should be credited for raising the profile of this once Tier-B character, to perhaps becoming more recognizable now, and obviously, expanding the fan base of this weaponry filled suit of metal, which of course, in this origin movie, we were only given a glimpse of its potential. can everyone now spell sequel and clamour for more please? Iron Man has set the bar for the other upcoming comic book movies to try and surpass this summer season!","

These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.Now I would say that this movie has slow but steady momentum-building. It is a movie for people who has never known Iron Man in the comic series. The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.Acting was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far. Effects were believable and not overwhelmingly CGI, except for the tank scene.This movie, however, has sequel written all over it. We know that because there are many scenes that could have lead to more.It's well worth its ticket price.","

"Iron Man","The_Film_Cricket","1 April 2014","Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"" brings the superhero genre to a rock star status. Frankly, it needs it. It is a breath of fresh air after the Superman and Batman pictures which have been so vapid and overproduced that they forgot to be fun. This movie overcomes all the handicaps that have kept the others down including the labored weight of the origin story. Yes, Tony Stark builds and Iron Man suit and becomes a superhero, but the script isn't belabored by getting all the pieces in place. This is a fun movie that allows it's hero to learn from his mistakes.What makes ""Iron Man"" work is that Favreau and his writers realize that a man in an iron suit can only be interesting as far as the special effects can carry it. So, their movie is heavily weighted toward the performance of Robert Downey Jr. who, as Tony Stark, is given free range over his best gift, his mouth. Stark is old money, a billionaire whose company builds on the legacy of his late father, building weapons to – quote – keep the peace – end quote. As the movie opens, he's in a convoy in Afghanistan, drink in hand, headed to a presentation of his new weapon system. You don't have to have superpowers to guess that his convoy is ambushed by members of a terrorist cell who want the famed metallurgist to build them a missile. What does he build instead? Well, just look at the title.What a guy this is. He has enough many to keep a small country in luxury for decades. He can build anything with a hammer and welding torch. He lives on a vast mountaintop estate in Malibu, California. He has jets, cars, and even a robot butler named J.A.R.V.I.S. whose voice sounds suspiciously like Paul Bettaney. He's also got a Barnum-like gift for salesmanship, selling arms around the world to keep things in line. This is caused him grief. He's been called a Merchant of Death, a man whose company deals in making war profits. He argues vehemently that his company helps keep the world at peace by fighting back against those who bring about war. That builds the bulk of the movie as Stark builds the Iron Man suit, his company.After an incident in Afghanistan, he decides to shut down the weapons division and focus on building his iron suit. That doesn't sit well with his second-in-command Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), and therein lies our villain. Bridges makes a good one. He's familiar to us as a nice guy, but here he proves that he can convincingly play a villain. It's not just a standard evil villain. There's something about Stane that gives he fuel to want what Stark has. It's a good performance.Also good is Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Starks's personal assistant and love interest. She could have been stuck in a thankless role, but Paltrow has been given something much more substantial to work with. She isn't all lips and glossy eyes. She has a brain and she tires of her employer's wreckless personality, that is, until she falls into his arms. The chemistry between Paltrow and Downey is something special.Yet, the greatest gift here is Robert Downey Jr. who's on the comeback trail. He's a wonderful actor who fell into a personal crisis but now seems to be on the road back. Recently, he's been turning in magnificent work in ""A Scanner Darkly"", ""Zodiac"", ""Tropic Thunder"" and the little-seen ""Lucky You."" He has a God-given talent and it's nice to finally see him getting back to great work. He gives a better performance here might seem necessary. He could have done a lot of posturing, but he gives Stark a personality that is light-hearted. It's a joy to watch.So is the movie. Jon Favreau has created a film that is exciting and fun. The script gives us more than we might expect, and it isn't all rock-em-sock-em crash and bash (though the movie employs those things). It isn't overwhelmed by marketing. This is a smart movie, with a lot of energy and style.","

"Iron Man","sacflyzone","23 April 2008","Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film.","

"Iron Man","ffiisshh","21 April 2008","WOW WOW WOW.This is the movie I have been waiting for for a very long time. I am an avid Ironman reader. I have collected the comics all my life (from #1 in 1968 to the latest in 2008)...40 years of Ironman. Since I was a kid, I used to say to my friends that they should make an Ironman movie, but everyone laughed and said that the special effects would look ridiculous...mind you, that was back in like in the early 1980's. But, now we are in the age of CGI, and what an age it is. Just for you Ironman fans, to see him come to life with such spectacular graphics is reason enough to spend your hard-earned $10. The plot is also pretty well thought out, and the acting is just fine. What better pick could you have for Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.? (just wait for the sequels when they can delve into his alcoholism...Mr. Downey has been there and beyond...that's probably why they chose him for the role...fore-thought)The rest of the cast is right on par, as well. The pace is brisk, and the whole thing works as a great addition to the Marvel Universe in the Cinema!! Enjoy!","

"Iron Man","Joejoesan","16 April 2008","From the first moment Robert Downey Jr comes on screen as Tony Stark, you know that this movie can't go wrong. We are in some desert in Afghanistan and wisecracking Stark tells something about his playboy life to some soldiers. Yes, this ain't no nerdy Peter Parker or tortured Wolverine. Our hero is a person who generally enjoys life (and women) and has no second thoughts on how he lives it. Without any doubt, of all the superheroes that exist, Tony Stark is the coolest person there is! But of course his bubble bursts when Stark is kidnapped by terrorists and forced to reproduce his killing missile, the Jericho. The sacrifice of a fellow scientist makes him humble and after his spectacular escape Stark decides to better his life. No more manufacturing of weapons for Stark Industries. From now on Stark wants to help his fellow men. Although this decision impresses some (like Stark's secretary Paltrow) it also infuriates others (like Stark's partner Jeff Bridges). This all leads to a action-packed finale in which Iron Man must face a deadly enemy...Iron Man is the big Robert Downey Jr. show. Downey not only brings humor and flamboyance to his role, he also manages to make you believe that an egocentric person can indeed change into a real humanitarian. The scene in which he realizes that someone is willing to make a sacrifice in order for him to escape is even a moving one. Well done. Downey is really a great actor with great charisma.But there is a lot more to Iron Man. There are four or five big action scenes. The first four are so great (the escape from the cave and a sequence involving an Afghan village) that the last one - the big finale - disappoints a little bit. But that's okay. There are also a lot of smaller scenes to be enjoyed, focusing on the relationship between Downey and Paltrow and the development of the Iron Man armour. Jeff Bridges is always great to look at, although his role could have been played by several other actors. Maybe his storyline is the weakest of the film. His betrayal is no surprise, but his early involvement in this is hard to believe. Iron Man is a spectacular and funny popcorn ride that not only has great action scenes, but also some great actors. Hopefully it will do very well at the box office, because I can't wait to see Iron Man 2. Enjoy!PS: no Samuel Jackson in this version either!8,5 out of 10","

"Iron Man","Chrysanthepop","9 May 2008","Until May 2008, the few releases this year that I've seen ranged from below average to downright rubbish with the exception of two movies. One being 'Iron Man'. This is the movie we have been waiting for this year. So does it match up to expectations? Hell yes! On the surface, 'Iron Man' isn't very different from other superhero films but on the other hand it isn't like any other superhero movie. This one has rich characters, it perfectly blends humour, drama, action and it has heart, all of which are presented on screen in a wonderful way that keeps the viewer staring at the screen right till the end. The writing is great as 'Iron Man' sticks to the main story all the way. I liked how Downey Jr's Tony Stark grows from this carefree business-minded tech-tycoon who's only concern is Stark Industries to a man with a mission to save the world and in the process he still stays the same person as he maintains his sense of humour, his courage and his integrity. The dialogues, especially Starks's one-liners are sharp, witty and funny. This movie is an introduction to the famous title character thus those expecting only action from start to end (like 'Transformers') may be disappointed to an extent. But for me there was enough action along with substance to make it a hugely enjoyable experience.Jon Favreau is proving to be a more versatile director and his impressive filmography, both as actor and director, prove that he's experimented with different kinds of cinema. 'Iron Man' wouldn't have been an easy film to direct but Favreau does a magnificent job. The CGI is excellent as I loved how much attention was given to detail and how the viewer is shown every step of the making of Iron Man. Of course, there's some humour added to lighten up the mood instead of technologically overloading the viewers.'Iron Man' is just the movie that Robert Downey Jr. needed and it couldn't have come at a better time. At a time, when this talented actor's performances were hardly getting enough notice, 'Iron Man' brings him back to recognition. After seeing him, one would conclude that the part was made only for Downey Jr. His dialogue delivery seems so natural that it would be hard to tell whether he was acting, if the scenes were taken out of context. I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow has ever looked better. Though the role does not allow her to really stretch her acting, Potts isn't just a typical superhero's dame. She is Tony's confidant and the one who supports him through thick and thin. Paltrow provides the necessary charisma, sex appeal and soul that makes Pepper Potts shine and she shares a sizzling chemistry with her male lead. Terrence Howard has a smaller role as Tony's good friend but there's a hint that he might have a more prominent role if a sequel is made. Finally, there's Jeff Bridges as the villain. An odd yet brilliant choice as the actor is refreshing and like his costar, he too needed an 'Iron Man' to give his career a boost.I noticed that some people were complaining that Muslims/Middle Easterners were portrayed as bad guys just like in any other American movie but I would like to state that this is no 'Vantage Point'. Here, these people weren't portrayed as terrorists working on their own but as men hired for a specific reason (I won't say more to give away spoilers). So I just thought to briefly clarify that this is no anti-Islamic or anti-anything (except, well okay, anti-weaponry) movie. It's a movie for everyone.Perhaps the story itself isn't anything novel which is what makes it somewhat similar to other superhero movies, but the treatment of it and its execution is quite unique. Add to that a fine cast and dazzling special effects among many things, this is the summer movie experience I've been waiting for in 2008. I wonder what else this summer has to offer as I doubt that it would succeed in providing anything close to the sheer entertainment of 'Iron Man'.","

"Iron Man","sidfargas","15 April 2008","All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Mark my words, Iron Man is such a movie. I've been privileged enough to view an advanced screening and, honestly, it's the best big budget movie that I've seen in many years. It hits a high standard of excellence for mass audiences by combining humor, a smart plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. The special effects and CGI are probably the best I've ever seen in terms of relatable effects. They're not over the top and don't overwhelm your senses. What's even more remarkable is this movie will surprise a lot of people with its depth while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Iron Man delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.The cast is obviously stellar but that doesn't always mean greatness. (American Gangster, Street Kings anyone?) I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Downey himself delivers one of the greatest performances in a comic adaptation film EVER. Maybe it's because the character itself is one of the most complex and intriguing that any genre has to offer but that doesn't diminish just what a home run Downey has hit. They took the character seriously but still remembered to include fun and humor. I almost can't convey how much I enjoyed his performance.Minor SPOILER....My only real complaint is the rumor of a Sam Jackson cameo was not fulfilled. He is even listed here as playing the character of Nick Fury. He did not appear in the cut that I saw. After browsing, it's been offered that his cameo was probably just removed for the early screenings. I hope that's true and they put it back for the final cut. This means I'll just HAVE to see this movie again. LUCKY ME!","

"Iron Man","disdressed12","23 November 2008","this is one movie that was way better than i thought it would be.it's not just an action movie.it's also a smart,cleverly written movie,with some great dialogue.it also incorporates real global problems,serving as a sort of commentary on our times.it's not preachy,it just shows how far we've progressed.or maybe regressed as a society.there is also the theme of redemption in the movie.i mentioned the good dialogue.an example of that is the witty banter between Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.)and his assistant Pepper Pots(Gwyneth Paltrow).beyond that though,Stark is generally witty.i liked the origin story of the film,though i can't say whether or not it's accurate to the comic book.naturally,there are some great action sequences,especially the flying scenes and the combat scenes.and that suit is very impressive,both in looks and functionality.as to the cast,Downey is very good as Stark/Iron Man.Paltrow is very likable as Pepper Potts.Terrance Howard is good as Stark's military friend Rhodey,but i feel he was underutilized.oh well,maybe the sequel will rectify that.i heard that Howard is being replaced in the sequel by Don Cheadle.nothing against Cheadle,but i think they ought to stick with Howard,since he originated the character in the film.but the best actor in the bunch,in my opinion is Jeff Bridges,who gives a William Hurt type performance,understated,yet simmering with passion and charisma.that's just my opinion.anyway,,the movie is fun and engaging,but it's no empty headed action movie.not that there's anything wrong with that.no,this is a smart movie with heart and soul.my vote for Iron Man: 9/10","

"Iron Man","g-bodyl","17 November 2008","Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called ""Ten Rings"" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion. I rate this movie 10/10.","

"Iron Man","jdkraus","16 May 2008","From all the hype I heard about this film, I decided to see it. I thought this would be another superhero movie disaster that has too much CGI and no plot, but I was proved wrong. Most superhero films don't have an academy award winning script, but ""Iron Man"" pulled off with a decent story that has no holes. I was very impressed by it, particularly with a surprising anti-gun/war message delivered nicely by Robert Downey Jr.To my surprise, Downey did a pretty good job as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He's funny, entertaining, and a hero that could easily be liked. Terrence Howard as the amusing Jim Rhodes and Gwyneth Paltrow (beautiful as ever) as Iron Man's assistant are pleasant additions to the film. Jeff Bridges wasn't a bad villain, although I did not find him to be in the caliber of Jack Nicholson as ""The Joker"" or even Willem Dafoe as the ""Green Goblin"".The one thing that I did not like about the movie though was the lack of romance. Whether it is Batman or Spider-man, the good guy always had a girl. Gwyneth Paltrow's character can be considered a damsel in distress at the end, but the relationship never grows between her and Iron Man. I'm not trying to sound like I am a lover of chick flicks, but in my opinion, a good superhero should always have a girl, or at least someone to love.Overall this is a great film with a solid plot, decent acting, and wonderful CGI that is not overdone. For you popcorn lovers, this is your ticket. 8/10","

Jeff Bridges was great, I thought Paltrow developed well as the film went on.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the acting and the visuals. Of course I liked the touches of humour that Robert Downey Jr. Added.Unlike some of the newer Marvel films I've seen, there seemed to be more focus on the plot and the characters, it wasn't just a special effects parade.8/10.","

It's Probably No Surprise that the Comic Book Company Knew just what to do with Their Own Creations. Although, Nothing in the Movie Universe is a Certain Thing, the Studio certainly Worked Wonders with this, one of Their Second String Characters.The Casting is Brilliant with Robert Downey Jr's. Perfect Embodiment of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and the Rest Contributing to the Fun. The Director, Jon Favreau, was a Risk. Hardly Known for Big-Budget Action Movies, He Captures the Spirit of the Comics and turned in an absolutely Brilliant Film from Top to Bottom.Fans of the Silver-Age Comics will No Doubt be Impressed. When Iron Man First Appeared in ""Tales of Suspense"" #39, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were in the Embryonic Stages of Reinventing Comics and the Marvel Super Hero Line was being Tested and no one At the Time (except maybe the Fans) had a Clue what They were Witnessing. In the Origin of Iron Man and for a while, the Character was this Hulky, Bulky, Tank-Like Hero, in a Clunky Iron Suit. Not the Sleek Hot Rod Red Iron Man to Come Later. In the Film, this Likeness can be Seen in the Opening where Tony Stark Creates the Character ""in a cave with a box of scraps"". This is a Spot-On Recreation from the Comics Origin Issues and it is a Great Insider's Inspiration and a Fine Tribute to the Movie's Paper Origins.This is just one of the Charms about Iron Man, The Movie.

"Iron Man","anaconda-40658","3 June 2015","Iron Man (2008): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Shaun Toub: Explosive action adventure about the unstoppable. Tony Stark is a genius weapons manufacturer whom is kidnapped in Afghanistan during a missile demonstration. In captivity he builds a suit of armor that would become his Iron Man persona. Director Jon Favreau establishes a plot that flows without pause. Favreau previously sprung success with the Christmas comedy Elf. Robert Downey Jr. plays off the sarcasm of Stark. He is wealthy yet intelligent as he must survive several months of captivity as well as confront a corrupt mind that was formerly on par with himself. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his loyal assistant who rises above being a standard damsel. She is instrumental in his recovery as well as becoming a safe source for his ideas. Jeff Bridges plays the villain whom uses Stark's weapons against him. They were friends at first until he becomes corrupt and musters into something of opposite proportions to Stark. Only Terrence Howard seems cardboard in his standard military role and friend that hardly elevates beyond routine. Shaun Toub plays a captive of Stark's but the character is apparently changed from his comic book identity. Tremendous special effects using Iron Man's initiation as a weapon as a statement regarding arms forces. Score: 9 ½ / 10","

"Iron Man","snoozejonc","27 December 2020","A billionaire weapons engineer builds a flying suit of armour.Iron Man is a highly enjoyable superhero origin movie powered by the charisma of Robert Downey Jr.The plot is a fairly simple redemption story that sees Tony Stark become Iron Man and do battle with villains both abroad and domestic.Special effects and cool technology reigns supreme as we are presented with a multitude of visual and auditory spectacle. The suit feels real and it provides scenes that both thrill and generate humour.There are some nice themes explored around warfare, weapons manufacturing and blood money. The character of Stark really is a good opportunity to address topics like this.Downey is perfectly cast and it's his personality that carries the film and entertains above all. Supporting performances work perfectly, particularly Gwynneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges.The soundtrack acquired for the movie enhances the rock star persona of Stark and probably rejuvenated sales of certain heavy metal albums.Ninety percent of the movie works for me until we get to the final showdown where I found myself somewhat out of the swing of it and at one point became highly aware I was watching two animated robotic characters smashing each other about.The final scene is excellent and a cool subversion of the standard identity cliches usually found in the superhero genre.","

"Iron Man","southdavid","1 February 2022","Having powered back through the Avengers films recently, and the ""Spider-man"" MCU series - I asked my son which set of films he'd like to see next and he chose ""Iron Man"". So, one Saturday afternoon we stuck it on and though some of the effects are starting to betray it's age a little - it's still a really solid base upon which the MCU was built.Having been captured by a terrorist organisation, billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) is ordered to create a missile for them, but instead creates a weaponised suit of armour that he uses to escape. Having seen the real usage of his weapons, he decides to withdraw Stark Enterprises from that industry and focuses on refining the suit idea making it one of the most powerful weapons in the world, but one that remains in his hands. These plans do not sit well with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), C. O. O of Stark Enterprises, who looks to remove his protégé from the company, one way or another.Again, it's interesting to see the film again, seeing it as it is now - the first step on a 25 film (so far) odyssey that would take us across the Galaxy and the Multiverse. Tonally, it's pretty much there from the start. Funny, but not a comedy. Honouring the inspirations but not beholden to them. There are so many parts that are already in place; Agent Coulson and SHIELD, Paul Bettany as JARVIS - a throwaway part that could have been played by anybody really - that developed into the Vision Role and Leslie Bibb, who would replay Christine Everhart several times across various aspects of the saga. Even stuff that was clearly a retrofitted, such as Peter Billingsley playing Riva - who would then appear in ""Far from Home"", 11 years later and play off his scene here. Most key though, is the post credits scene, both the concept of them - and the ""I'm putting together a team"" line.What's less consistent ... well, they would recast Rhodey, obviously and Howard Stark as he became a more important character in subsequent films. It's a lot less in terms of consequences, than most films would be about in the future - admittedly, there's keeping a weapon away from a bad guy, which thinking about it does become a staple plot for the MCU - but it's not about saving the world or even America this time. As I said above too, occasionally the CGI is showing it's age a little - with regards interactions between RDJ's fact and the Ironman helmet specifically.Looking back now, is it one of my favourite MCU films? No, not really - but that speaks more to the quality of others than to any failure on behalf of what is a fun, funny and fantastic film.","

"Iron Man","bowmanblue","5 July 2014","'Iron Man' is the surprise superhero hit from Marvel Studios which charts the tale of billionaire weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark, to the flying metal superhero 'Iron Man.' It seemed that, despite its impressive budget, no one quite imagined this lesser (when compared with the more famous – and bankable – superheroes such as Spiderman, Batman and Superman) hero to become quite as bigger box office draw as it turned out. And it definitely isn't 'wall-to-wall action' which drew the crowds in.To be honest, there isn't an awful lot of 'Iron Man' in Iron Man the movie. Our hero, Tony Stark (expertly played by Robert Downey Jr) only gets inside his costume about three times in a two hour movie. Therefore, don't expect a load of 'Michael Bay-style' explosions every few minutes.You have to get the 'origins' side of Iron Man out of the way here, showing how he transgresses from playboy billionaire to concerned citizen, prepared to put his life on the limb to save the world. So a lot of the story is taken up with HOW he becomes the titular character.However, don't let any lack of action fool you into thinking this isn't going to be one hell of a ride. Somehow, everything just works and the two hours fly by faster than Iron Man outrunning some jet fighters.You don't have to love comic books or superheroes to appreciate that this is a really fun film. It's nowhere near as dark as Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and sticks to its upbeat and colourful comic book roots. It's a great popcorn film for all the family and even having Gwyneth Paltrow in it doesn't detract from the fun element *miaow! http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","

Tte only thing I felt was lacking in the film was the twists, which were all, admittedly, very predictable, there was not anything that surprised or shocked me. It is an action packed, thrilling adventure, it had me at the edge of my seat many times as we genuinely care for these characters.

"Iron Man","Chris_Docker","30 April 2008","Since Marvel Comics and CGI started their mystical marriage in the late 1990s, we've had superheroes galore. Hulks, Surfers, Spidermen, not to mention constantly renewed Batmans and Supermans. So what does Iron Man have to offer that's different? A flawed character that becomes honourable is the answer, triumphing in the battle of Good over Evil in spite of being a bit of a prat.Add to that some of the best features of Robocop, Batman Begins and Terminator II, and you have one of the more satisfying comic-books-turned-blockbuster that we've seen for a while.Billionaire and genius Tony Stark  with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes  is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. Forced to work for them, he has other plans. Stark, nicely played by Robert Downey Jr, fashions a hi-tech suit of armour - before going on to save the world in usual exemplary fashion.This long build-up  to explain how he becomes Iron Man  is arguably the best part of the film. Ingenious special effects give Stark's futuristic Malibu mansion a sci-fi rather than fantasy feel. And the subtle build-up makes us more forgiving as the story slips slowly into comic-book reality.There are, of course, compromises. It has to appeal to kids as well as adults, so there is none of the gutsiness of Terminator I (or similar adult-orientated sci-fi). And in spite of the heavy moral-political issues at stake, Iron Man stays politically bland  this being the only way to get D.O.D. approval and hence associated goodies like fighter jets and military hardware.One of the most interesting ideas for me in the film was the idea of 'zero accountability'. This takes the form of having all the wealth, brains and playboy attributes that fiction writers can imagine, but could also be a symbol for U.S. military might, for instance. Stark's first premise, of power being the ultimate deterrent (and hence a peace-keeping force) is undermined when the enemy gets hold of the same weapons and starts killing indiscriminately. Theologians might also muse how power itself has no moral authority. Good guys have to grudgingly beseech permission from whoever wields the biggest thunderbolt.Iron Man, essentially a symbol of power, abounds in biblical references, even if these come more from the comic book creators than any learning on the part of filmmakers. Jericho, the name given to Stark's finest military weapon, was the city that had to be destroyed, 'as an outward display of faith.' Which makes for great symbolism. Until you consider that modern-day Jericho is in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, and then Stark's 'rockets' start to look a lot more loaded.Iron Man's technology has a special feature to avoid targeting civilians. Now this is one military development I would love to see.The second half of the movie is pure action, but with a well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged. Out-of-reach love-interest materialises as Gwyneth Paltrow, who I found very agreeable to watch, and the excellent supporting cast also includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. This is a film that tries to please everyone and largely succeeds. It's a two-hour thrill-ride that offers a new action-hero for our CGI-sated palates.On a personal note, my big disappointment was the title track  or rather lack of it. Having heard one of the most famous heavy metal riffs of all time in the trailer, I couldn't wait to see Iron Man flying through the skies to the sound of Black Sabbath's rock anthem. Sadly, the riff is all you get (probably cos the words seem to be based on an altogether different story). But if you sit through the closing credits hoping for more, you do at least get a very important extra scene. So you've been warned: don't leave the cinema beforehand!","

"Iron Man","tomgillespie2002","11 May 2013","It seems strange to think that this was considered a big gamble back in 2008, when Marvel Studios finally began putting into place the ensemble of superhero films that would lead to the fantastically entertaining The Avengers. They hired a relatively rookie director in Jon Favreau who, up to this point, had made the shoddy Made (2001), Will Ferrell vehicle Elf (2003) and kiddie-flick Zathura (2005), and cast Robert Downey Jr., an actor that was still trying to piece together his career after years of drug and alcohol abuse. After all, Iron Man is basically a story about a rich genius who fights crime in a flying metal suit, and had it not being given the necessary thought and care, this could have been a disaster. Thankfully, it's anything but, thanks to Downey Jr.'s infectious performance, a razor-sharp screenplay by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, and Favreau's confident direction.Weapons manufacturer and playboy Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) travels to Afghanistan with his good friend Lt. Colonel Rhodes (Terrence Howard) to show off his new weapon of mass destruction, the Jericho. He is ambushed and taken hostage by a terrorist group that call themselves the Ten Rings, who seriously wound Stark, causing shrapnel to lodge dangerously close to his heart. An electromagnet is developed by fellow captive Yinsen (Shaun Toub) to keep the shrapnel away from his heart, and the two are forced to build the Jericho from parts of Stark's stolen weapons. He instead builds a prototype metal suit, which he uses to all but destroy the terrorist group and escape back to America. After calling a press conference where he announces that Stark Industries will cease war profiteering, Stark builds his Iron Man suit with the help of his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Seeing stocks falling and the potential collapse of the company, Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) wants the technology for himself.The main problem that faces most superhero origin films is having to combine the protagonist's development into the hero of the title with a villain capable of giving the hero a genuine threat to face, as well as blending them together to form one cohesive storyline. Marvel in particular have had trouble with their super-villains, with only Thor's multi-dimensional Loki, played with a thespian quality by Tom Hiddleston, proving successful. Iron Man suffers here too, only it seems almost irrelevant. Obadiah Stane does eventually don a gigantic metal suit for a big showdown at the climax, but Stane's menace comes from his corporate greed, offering only slight hints at what goes on in the big, bald dome of his, while coming across as a trusted friend to Stark.It is Stark's personal development that takes centre stage, and it's a true joy to watch it. At first, he is cocky, smarmy, and filthy-rich, and after he gets a wake-up call, he is still cocky, smarmy and filthy- rich. Only now he understands the devastation his weapons program is inflicting of thousands of innocents, who up until now, Stark has casually viewed through the safety of his television. In the wrong hands, Stark could have been a disaster, apparently caring little for the ramifications of his actions, buying priceless works of art he'll never see just because he can. Downey Jr. injects the same energy he's been putting into his characters throughout his entire career - fast- talking and wise-cracking, almost comically narcissistic. But Downey Jr. is best at giving his characters an underlying sense of damage beneath the cocky exterior, perhaps a reflection on his long-standing problems in real-life, and this helps give Stark an undeniable depth, and therefore making him effortlessly fascinating to watch.Iron Man is most entertaining when showing Stark at work - bashing various parts together, interacting with his robots and his house computer Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany), and testing his newly acquired powers. His first flying trial has him hovering uncomfortably and struggling for complete control, destroying his hoard of expensive super cars in the process. It's a funny, exciting scene, rounded off with ""yeah, I can fly"". It's rare for a superhero film to be so successful in portraying the development of its character, whether having to experience a mutation, an experiment gone wrong, or facing childhood fears, this proves that simply building a metal super-suit is far more entertaining. This is still Marvel's best pre-Avengers effort, including it's vastly inferior sequel, and Tony Stark was the best to watch amongst the massive ensemble when the giant ego's finally came together. But that's all down to the care given to this film, which is quite simply a massive hoot.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","

"Iron Man","Vartiainen","17 August 2013","This stands in my personal ratings as one of the best superhero movies of all time, if not as one of the best movies of all time. It's that good.What makes the movie stand out from its brethren is, first of all, the sheer quality. Everything in this film feels just right. The character of Tony Stark is dead on. I believe that even the most hardcore Marvel nerd would agree that Robert Downey Jr. was perfectly cast for this role. He epitomizes the character beautifully, from the raw charisma to the brilliance of mind to the witty comebacks to the vulnerability of alcoholism. The movie would work just because of him (which the sequels will show), but luckily we get even more for our money. We get special effects that defied all of our expectations, we get a fetching origins story, we get Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Cane (one of his best recent roles) and Gwyneth Paltrow as the perfect Pepper Potts. This is very heavily a character film, which I don't mind at all when the characters are as good as this. Sure there are great action scenes and it's a nice film visually, but it works and it's so good because the characters work off each other so well. You can feel the underlying tension whenever those three share screen time.I could nitpick here and state that perhaps the whole film felt a bit rushed because they had to cram to much material into a single film, or that the final battle could have been slightly better (mostly because of the villainous gloating cliché), but all these minor complaints pale in comparison to the film as a whole. I love this film. It's a brilliant character study, an even more brilliant action film and one of the best superhero movies yet made. See it, love it.","

"Iron Man","Michael_Elliott","23 December 2008","Iron Man (2008) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is forced to build an armored suit in order to escape from a group of terrorists but after reaching safety he decides to use technology to help people. I never was a comic book movie guy but my opinion on them has changed over the past couple years since directors and screenwriters decided to throw some brains into the film. Here's another fine example of a film that has something to say and doesn't just resort to non-stop action and slapstick violence. The movie is extremely well made, wonderfully acted and contains some great special effects and that makes it one of the better films of its type. I think the key to this film working is the performance by Downey, Jr. who makes you feel as if everything you're watching could really happen. I think a lot of times you really have to suspend your disbelief but that's not the case here because Downey is so great that you feel he really knows how to create this suit and make it work. I loved the early scenes before the terrorist attack when Downey uses his comic skills because this shows what a changed man he is after he is able to escape. The supporting cast is also very good with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges doing fine work, although I felt both of their characters could have been written better. Gwyneth Paltrow is the one who really shocked me because I had seen many of her artsy films and was shocked at how well she could handle this material. The chemistry between her and Downey is great and adds a lot of suspense to the film especially in the final minutes. Favreau does a wonderful job with his directing duties and manages to keep the story movie and to keep the viewer entertained even though the final Iron Man doesn't show up until a hour into the film. I'm not a fan of CGI because I feel most directors don't know how to use it but that's not the case here because the effects fit in well with the story and they never try to be the main focus of the film.","

"Iron Man","caseynicholson","8 January 2015","This film is not the first movie to feature characters from Marvel Comics. The 2000's saw the ""X-Men"" franchise, a ""Hulk"" movie, two ""Fantastic Four"" movies, and the Toby Maguire ""Spider-Man"" trilogy. However, all of those movies were films that Marvel outsourced to various companies--notably Fox and Sony. ""Iron Man"" is the first film to be made in house by Marvel Studios, and as such it's the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, i.e. the first film that will come to interact with characters from other films that are not direct sequels. For this reason, ""Iron Man"" is worth watching if you happen to be a fan of any of the other MCU movies, especially ""The Avengers"" series. ""Iron Man"" begins the process of building continuity across different Marvel films, and for the true nerds amongst us there are many tidbits of information in this movie that are beneficial to understanding the rest of the MCU films. Still, the main reason to watch this movie is not its place in the MCU, but its value as a standalone film. Marvel Studios set out to prove themselves with this movie, and they delivered a hit. The film is a solid two hours of thrills that features a robust and engaging storyline and fantastic acting. Robert Downey, Jr. defines the role of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges all turn out dynamic performances. Bridges especially shines as Obadiah Stain, and contributes much to the movie. That said, I give this film nine out of ten stars. It's one of the best in the comics movie genre, and I only stop myself from giving it a ten because I try to reserve that score for movies I see as not only great, but perfect. ""Iron Man"" comes mighty close to that, and I'm sure you'll agree that it deserves high marks. Oh, and don't forget to watch the post-credits scene, which foreshadows the rest of the MCU!","

"Iron Man","SubZeroMK","31 May 2009","I was hyped for the movie when it was on the internet as news. I wasn't the biggest fan of Iron-Man at the time, but I always liked Robert Downey Jr., because he's a phenomenal actor. Not only that, but having Jon Favreau on board made me want to watch this film even more. He's a great comedic actor, and would seem like a cool buddy to hang out with.So I went in there with high expectations and I came out very satisfied at what I just had seen. I couldn't think of anyone else who could play Iron-Man better than Robert Downey. Thanks to this film, I put Iron-Man at the second spot in my favorite super-hero list. Blade comes first.Of course I bought the blu-ray version of the movie, watched all the special features and it was great. The action was great, it was planned out where it was needed. Jeff Bridges also did a great job on his character, acting as a mentor and then as Iron-Man's enemy. He didn't like to put up with the selfish rich guy, I get it, no one likes that.Overall, a 10/10 for creativity. Now, I'm anxious for the sequel, and you know what they say about sequels, they're always the best ones in the series.","

"Iron Man","IPyaarCinema","3 February 2021","Review By Kamal KIron Man, one of the most important movies of its kind. When it first came out in 2008, I don't think anybody expected it to be as big a hit as it was. A B-list superhero played by a washed-up actor being produced by a barebones studio? Are you nuts? And then we were all surprised to see how great it was.It's thanks in large part to Robert Downey Jr. He really is Iron Man. He manages to give that real sense of a ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."" It's hard to imagine anybody else playing Tony Stark this far along in the franchise's lifespan.This movie was most people's entry point into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Having only recently re-watched it, I still can't believe how small it was at this point. Nowadays we see aliens, talking raccoons, and sentient trees, but Iron Man has a realism to it that keeps it grounded while still being comic-booky.Twelve years after its release, the special effects still manage to hold up. The Iron Man suit's CGI still looks as real as possible, and it would still be in the same elite company as movies like Thor: Ragnarok or Ant-Man.Again, this is a movie that really shouldn't have worked so well, but I'll be damned if Jon Favreau and Kevin Feige didn't pull it off. It's a movie that I'll return to for years to come, if for no reason other than to marvel (heh) at how much Tony Stark has grown up since. Can't wait for new fans to experience this movie as well as the rest of the MCU.","

"Iron Man","Quinoa1984","2 May 2008","Iron Man is about as close to perfect popcorn entertainment as we can expect in this beginning of the summer season. But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark's as a character not exactly the usual 'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada' thing. He has a more jaded attitude, slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait, sorry, iron, or alloy as it is). I'm almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters, only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money, lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire, and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don't identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And, when the time comes, he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time, when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, he does have a level of conscience from the start, realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there, though it's pretty much that), and wants to not want this any longer. Instead, basically, he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan, he'll come and wipe em out in a jiffy. In this sense it's pure escapism, but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True, it might be much to imagine, but in the realm of a comic book movie, where we're already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he's that damn good.It's a thrill-ride, and it's very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in, for example, Ghost Rider. It's genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane, yeah you read that right), or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake, this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast. You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man, but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can't do it with a George Clooney, but with Downey Jr. it's a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He's able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero, but also hint at the fact that he's playing this character for what he is, and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him, it wouldn't work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it's due, also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is, basically, the ""anti-dude"" as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark's technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow, where'd she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well, and a couple of other supporting parts, they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director, who should get credit where it's certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer, going up through Made, Elf, and the recent bomb Zathura, it's a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go, he doesn't tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick, efficient film-making, and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched 'test' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here, Favreau's is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line, and how its delivered and in the context, is worth the price of admission.Oh, and by the way, stay through the end credits. If you're geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches), you'll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.","

"Iron Man","ametaphysicalshark","5 May 2008","Unlike pretty much all the superhero movies out there other than the Hellboy movies, I found ""Iron Man"" improved on second viewing. I'd go as far as saying that it's the best superhero film to date, although I'd have to see ""Hellboy II"" again before being sure about it. This film is near perfect as a summer entertainment. Light and largely insubstantial, but still not dumb in the slightest, and actually featuring some interesting writing for Tony Stark. The standard-issue moral dilemmas are handled well, without the stifling seriousness and heavy-handedness which sometimes let down the Nolan Batman films. We care about the dilemmas not necessarily due to their nature but because Tony Stark is such a convincing character.I'm going to be drawing comparisons to ""The Dark Knight"" throughout this 'review'. I do so not because I dislike ""The Dark Knight"" (in fact until a few hours ago I thought I liked it a tad more than ""Iron Man""), but because I'm attempting to make a case for ""Iron Man"" as the best summer blockbuster released in 2008, and the best superhero film to date. ""The Dark Knight"" is often praised for being more adult and darker than any other superhero film to date. First off, 'more adult' and 'darker' aren't necessarily the same thing. ""The Dark Knight"" is, on paper, really not all that more ludicrous than ""Iron Man"", nor is it a better story, nor are the characters more interesting. Bruce Wayne barely exists in ""The Dark Knight"", Rachel Dawes isn't up to much, Harvey Dent's transformation isn't all that convincing.Beyond just that, the film is stiflingly dark and humorless, almost to a fault because, well, it is about a guy walking around in a batsuit and fighting a maniac in clown makeup and a guy with half a face. The dialogue is often of an obviously expository nature. Where ""The Dark Knight"" is better than ""Iron Man"" is in the visual style. It also boasts a better villain. On the other hand, ""Iron Man"" is a straightforward superhero movie. It's odd, after so many superhero films, to finally see one which really feels like reading a superhero comic. I am not a fan of Iron Man or Marvel in general, but have read some good Iron Man comics in the past, and this film so wonderfully captures the nature of a superhero comic. Sure, Jeff Bridges' villain isn't great, but he fits very nicely into the story of the movie. The story's really very good too. The real heart of the film though is with Iron Man himself. While I give a lot of credit to Robert Downey Jr., who gives a performance which, like Heath Ledger's in ""The Dark Knight"", is well beyond the standard for popcorn fare. The complaints about the film having no character development are also pretty unwarranted. Granted, Pepper Potts isn't up to much, but what really matters is Tony Stark himself and I found him not only convincingly portrayed but quite excellently-written as well. The film is concerned with the origins of Iron Man, not with the origins of Tony Stark. We hear about his father, we see what he was like before being in captivity, but the film doesn't bother with the usual clichéd approach which basically usually means the character is defined by two, maybe three if you're lucky, big, clichéd events in his life. All we need to know for this specific film (there's more to come from Iron Man, let's not forget) is who Tony Stark is NOW, and what went through his head after being in captivity and building the suit. With that in mind I felt ""Iron Man"" provided a well-rounded lead character, much more interesting than Bruce Wayne in ""The Dark Knight"" and more substantial than Hellboy or Peter Parker or pretty much most of the rest with specific regard to the movie incarnations of the characters.The screenplay's wise approach to the origin story means it can focus on the story. It's all pretty standard-issue stuff but done well, and while not insightful or deep or anything it certainly isn't a totally lunkheaded approach to the subject matter: the impact of weapons technology and advancements in the field on the world. Also what really matters is that it's a tight, lean screenplay, and while the climactic battle is a little underwhelming (and unfortunately starts feeling a bit like ""Transformers""), it is at least very well-shot, with a sort of clarity which helps all the action scenes here shine. The film is a well-made, tightly-constructed movie which is as long as it should be, and one which strikes a solid balance between character and story. Robert Downey Jr. is a big part of the film's success, no doubt, but credit should go to director Jon Favreau and the writers as well, because they really managed to deliver a movie that's a hell of a lot of fun, and one with easily the best central character in any superhero movie to date, and I say this as someone who definitely doesn't count Iron Man as their favorite superhero as far as comics go.","

"Iron Man","mstomaso","4 May 2008","Tony Stark - playboy, technological genius, and CEO of the world's largest defense contractor - is about to have a major change of heart. Inexperienced in the reality of war and arms trading, Stark is about to become a prisoner of of a terror cell in Afghanistan. The experience will change everything for him. To escape, he must exceed his greatest technological achievements, and in so doing, he envisions a new way to live for him and his firm.Iron Man is, far and away, the best film adaptation of a comic book 'origin story' that I have seen adapted to film. Marvel is certainly on a roll at the movies, but the real genius here is not just in the original material. The casting, script and directing make Iron Man a thorough-going success. The film has the pace of a military thriller (though it is more of an action film), the visual appeal of a well-crafted sci-fi spectacular (though it never sacrifices story to spectacle), and an abundance of talent (although star power does not drive this film).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges (Obie Stane) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper) own the screen, and are nicely supported by Terence Howard and a number of talented character actors. Downey is a perfect Tony Stark - flippant, too-smart-for-his-own-good, utterly dedicated and - at times - hilarious. While the film is far from a one-man-show, Downey's performance could have made this a great comics film even without the fine work by the rest of the cast.I was also pleased by the appearance of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the film, and hope that their appearance is a foreshadow of things to come, not just a cameo.Highly recommended for fans of the genre.","

"Iron Man","Buddy-51","19 January 2009","Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age). A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion. He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a ""merchant of death,"" but he balks at being called ""the Da Vinci of our time""). Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity. Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and vanquishing the wrongdoers.""Iron Man"" soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards. But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time. He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made ""Iron Man"" what it is without him. Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory. These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen. James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in ""Iron Man"" - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie. It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film. And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be. It's nice to see that somebody finally got things right.","

"Iron Man","utgard14","30 May 2014","Outstanding movie and possibly the best Marvel's done to date, at least as far as their shared universe films go. Let's cut right to the chase: Robert Downey, Jr. makes this movie work. I'm not going to say he's the perfect Tony Stark because Downey's Stark is really very different from how he has always been in the comics. But it works far better this way and is a huge point in favor of deviating from the source material, which is the eternal struggle between Hollywood and anything it adapts. This is one case where the changes they made worked out great. The rest of the cast is terrific, all following Downey's lead very well. His enthusiastic performance is a joy to watch. I'm sure it must have been a ball for Paltrow, Bridges, and the rest to act with him as they all seem to be having a great time in their scenes together. Jon Favreau does a praiseworthy job of directing, especially when he hadn't really done this type of movie before. The action and special effects are great. The script is smart and funny, though a lot of the humor comes from the ad-libbing of Downey and co-stars, so I'm not sure how much credit I can give the script for that. It's really a wonderful piece of entertainment without being mindless or crude. One of the best superhero films ever made.","

"Iron Man","CinemaClown","23 March 2015","Marking the commencement of Marvel Cinematic Universe, catapulting Robert Downey Jr. into the league of Hollywood's biggest stars & also announcing the arrival of Marvel Studios into motion picture filmmaking for it is their first fully-financed project, Iron Man not only succeeds as a quality blend of style & substance but is also amongst the best origin stories cinema has come up with for a comic book superhero.Iron Man tells the story of genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark who, while on his tour to war-torn Afghanistan for the demonstration of his new weaponry to United States military, is ambushed & taken hostage by a terrorist group. Working with another captive, he designs an exoskeleton to get out from there & after returning to US further refines his design. The plot covers the change his captivity brings in his entire personality.Stylishly directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man aims for the same grounded approach Nolan applied in Batman Begins & succeeds amazingly well for the most part. The screenplay is brimming with energy, wit & charm, and is brilliantly written & narrated. Production design provides it a very modern feel, Camera-work is vibrantly carried out, Editing briskly paces the whole story which also benefits from Ramin Djawadi's fitting score as well as clever use of existing songs.Coming to the acting department, Iron Man features a star-studded cast in Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges & Terrence Howard but the film belongs to Downey Jr. who blazes brightly in red n gold with a performance that's absolutely fantastic, effortlessly charismatic & downright polished. Overshadowing the input of the rest & fitting the suit perfectly, this is one role that couldn't have gone to a better actor & how this gifted talent renders Tony Stark on screen is a further proof of that.On an overall scale, Iron Man has enough power in it to please both fans of the comics as well as newcomers. Sure its third act isn't as impressive as the first two but the positives eclipse the negatives by a huge margin. Balancing its storytelling aspects with big budget extravaganza to triumph as a work of quality in the eyes of viewers n critics alike, Iron Man is a highly refreshing, wildly entertaining & largely satisfying crowd-pleaser that's hugely responsible for the foundation on which Marvel Studios stands today. Highly recommended.","

Yes it lacks the real gut-wrenching depth of the Dark Knight Trilogy, but it wasn't really aiming for that.This is incredible action, humour met with a good story and the most excellent decision to cast Downey in the titular role.Hit the lights, pump up the volume, popcorn at the ready....GO GO GO","

"Iron Man","ivo-cobra8","21 October 2015","Iron Man (2008) is American Marvel Superhero Action film and the best one in the trilogy. It is my favorite best superhero film that I love to death!!! The film has awesome Action sequences, it is Entertaining with full suspense, it is intense and it is fast paced. The film is not boring or lame it is brilliant and awesome. You have to put brain in this film. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man did a wonderful job portraying a comic book superhero. I love the Action sequence, the Drama, the genius and brilliance of Tony how he was so brilliant as to build those missiles for Military but get's caught by the terrorists and he is hold as hostage in the caves of Afghanistan, against his will he has to build more missiles for the terrorist, but he builds for himself a suit and he escapes from the caves, he returns home. Tony shut's down the factory and than he starts building an red yellow armor suit and he turns him self in to a vigilante to an red yellow armored suit ultimate superhero ""Iron Man"". He goes back in to Afghanistan and destroys all his weapons and he defends the weakest people. He also has a blue heart in the chest because the shrapnel hits him. He finds out he was betrayed by his dad's partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who turns him self into Iron Monger on the end there is an ultimate showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane did a wonderful job portraying a super villain in this film. Gwyneth Paltrow did a beautiful terrific performance as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant and his love interest. I love this film and is one of my favorite Marvel Superhero action films. Everything in this comic book film is in here. The CGI Iron Man are believable and terrific I have ever seen. They aren't bad, they are good. Jon Favreau did a wonderful and amazing job as directing this film and playing Tony's bodyguard as Harold 'Happy' Hogan the same time, that was amazing!! This film is brilliant I love how it shows Tony's tests scenes when he is building the armor suit, I love how Shows that Tony isn't self selfish centered jerk, he is a good heart person and he wants to do the right thing. To defend an innocent people from his weapons that he build and that his weapons got in to the wrong hands. It is an awesome how he redeem himself and how he had a conscious what was he done when he was building those weapons and how many people had to die. The original film is very good :) One hell of a film. The chemistry between Tony and Pepper is great, this film has a heart. The acting was great and the story was really good! This was definitely one of the best origin stories out there and the ending was fantastic! The fight scenes between Iron Man and Iron Monger was weary intense and awesome kick ass battle between those two super villains and heroes. I went into this film with an open mind and what we got, we got an fantastic comic book film. Paramount pictures sends a strong message to film comic book fans. So Iron Man is one of those movies. Jon Favreau did an amazing job of bring Iron Man to life. He so took the comic and make it look like we just watch this first time. The writing work so well with the actors with their roles. There's a lot of development into the writing and made relate to the comics. But of course the main that people loved this film is Robert Downey Jr. He killed it as Tony Stark and Iron Man. I couldn't see any other actor to take the role. He brings so much development and emotions into Tony and make you relate to him real easy. The rest of the actors did very well, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Palltrow all did an amazing job with their roles.After surviving an unexpected attack in enemy territory, jet-setting industrialist Tony Stark builds a high-tech suit of armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man. Straight from the pages of the legendary comic book, Iron Man is a hero who is built - not born - to be unlike any other.Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.1 It is the first installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, with a screenplay by Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway. It stars Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub and Gwyneth Paltrow. In Iron Man, Tony Stark, an industrialist and master engineer, builds a powered exoskeleton and becomes the technologically advanced superhero Iron Man.Iron Man is one the most surprise and best superhero films of all time with it's great story, amazing acting and great writing. If you people want a fun superhero film, then this is the one for you. Iron Man (2008) is my favorite best Marvel Action superhero alongside Batman, Captain America, Spider-Man, Thor and Superman. I love this film to death. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Marvel Studios, Paramount Pictures Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L.

"Iron Man","dunmore_ego","18 May 2008","*Iron Man* is a steel-belted planet-crusher of a film; alloy feet on the ground, red-and-gold armor streaking for sub-orbital skies. Based in a reality close to current, like the shrapnel lodged in Tony Stark's chest, we feel it close to our heart technology, physics, corporate backbiting, intimate asides and a self-made hero that speaks in tongues to our wild fantasies of power.Not just for 14-year-old boys.Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, all-American, arrogant, insouciant, egomaniacal billionaire playboy weaponry wizard, who sustains a shrapnel wound in Afghanistan (comic book lore tells us a land mine in Nam; movie places Stark in a *current* non-essential conflict), imprisoned by generic Arabs and forced to make a WMD for them, instead designing an armor suit, first for escape from his oily-complected captors, and then as avenger (wink wink) *against* his own weapon creations and the corporate back door deals that cede those American weapons into oily-complected hands.Departing considerably from comic book canon, all the familiar characters are here, but tweaked: Jim Rhodes (excellent Terence Howard) is not just Stark's pilot, but a high-ranking air force officer; Pepper Potts (moderately cute Gwyneth Paltrow) is Stark's yearning Girl Friday, who sees the parade of fluff through Tony's bedroom as a prelude to her ultimate spanking; Obadiah Stane (an uncharacteristically sinister Jeff Bridges) is not a corporate competitor but in Stark's trusted inner circle, making his betrayal all the more treacherous Directed by Jon Favreau (Vince Vaughn's wife) and screen played surprisingly well by its four writers, *Iron Man* takes its time focusing on the man inside the metal, rather than the mayhem the metal man musters. (Can I have a prize for that one?) In captivity, a fellow prisoner, Yinsen (Shaun Toub) creates an electromagnet to keep the shrapnel from entering Stark's heart, which Stark refines into a glowing ""reactor"" or something, forever to remain his albatross - and simultaneously a cool superhero chest-piece.Yinsen turns Stark from unrepentant war dog to humanitarian avenger by telling him of his ""life's work in the hands of these murderers."" Let's get the ""murderer"" definition straight: when Stark shows off his death-dealing toys in callous arrogance (""Respected or feared? I say, Why not both?""), he merely echoes the stance of the Amerikan Military War Machine, who also believe the ""best weapon is the one you only need to fire once."" Who are the murderers again? Secondly, a business genius like Stark should know how the supposed ""enemy"" market is the house of sand the Amerikan military economy is built upon. When it comes to killing for profit, Amerikan ethics are quite, quite plastic. The first taste of the crude, silver armor is magnificent. Though the '63 comic book version now looks like a clown suit next to his red-and-gold juggernauts, the movie gussies up the suit with mechanical ganglions to lend it cave-cred. And in this roughshod mechanical man, Stark escapes the Arabs like a runaway tank.Back in ""civilization"" Stark turns his focus from corporate warfare to one project  his new armor. Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges scares us with his shaved head.Seeing Stark create and test the powers of his technological marvel is half the fun of this origin tale - and when the full armor suit is eventually revealed, it is the sexiest beast this side of Optimus Prime! CGI is used as sensibly as Ridley Scott used it in *Gladiator*  to enhance the story rather than to blow our minds with cheap shots. Seeing Iron Man out-fly combat jets and take on tanks is action enough AND - the worst part about Doctor Doom in *Fantastic Four* was his voice remaining the fruity scientist's drawl even when he donned the mask  but when Stark slams on his iron man  yeeees! - he has a Vader thoom! We have CGI to thank that Favreau didn't put Downey in a rubber suit and dub in clanking foley. And with the armor's complexity, it is only logical a machine should suit him up - and only CGI could render that machine, rather than having to see him pull on his gleaming jeans one pants-leg at a time.The CGI only falls overboard once, when Stane dons giant armor to battle Iron Man in the final scenes, the movie suddenly turning into *Transformers 2: Electric Boogaloo* for a bad second. In the final cut, no one will notice the ethics paradox  it's not for this movie's target demo to tangle with. *Iron Man* is still one of the great superhero movies.IRON MAN opens with AC/DC's *Back in Black.* And we're played out by Sabbath's *Iron Man*! Not just for 14-year-old boys. But it'll sure make you feel like one.","

"Iron Man","VithDos","17 April 2008","So the world premier of Iron man to regular movie going audiences happened to be here in Seoul Korea on an army installation. I got to check it out and I was delightfully surprised.Much against the hype, I thought this movie would have been torrid trash acting mingled with cheesy fight scenes. I mean Robert Downey Jr as an action superhero? But I am glad to admit that I misjudged the movie completely. Downey played a very good Tony Stark, in generally every way. From his jokes to his obnoxious lifestyle he looked and walked the part very well. His banter with his right hand assistant Ms. Pepper Potts isn't mind numbing and actually found myself laughing aloud at some of the wit.The movie itself moved at a very good pace. Mixing action, comedy and some drama to just about the right proportions. As with most superhero movies, its rather predictable, but in all the right ways you'd want a superhero movie to be. The animation used was almost seamless, and of course the Iron Man costume was kicking major ass.My only gripe with the movie was the fact that several characters were thrown into the mix with little behind them other than 2D character attributes. Leslie Bibb's character, Christine Everhart, is pretty useless other than the two or three lines she has. Hardly worth a hardbody like Leslie Bibb to play. Several other characters didn't feel fleshed out at all. Raza (Faran Tahir), Obediah Stone (Jeff Bridges) , and even Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) feel hollow in the fact that they have little justification for many of their actions.So All in all, I'd give this movie an 8.3. Fun for the whole family, great pacing, and a Superhero movie to give the next Batman movie a run for its money.","

"Iron Man","r96sk","13 January 2021","My first taste of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A great start!I absolutely enjoyed seeing 'Iron Man'. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as the titular character, who is a blast to watch throughout - love the design! The plot is very entertaining, I like how it tells the story; simply, but very effectively. Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow, meanwhile, all add to the film with good performances.The special effects are very neat, as are all the action sequences. I will say the score isn't the strongest, at least in terms of what I'd expect from this sorta film. I wouldn't say it's bad per se, just not as spectacular as it could've (should've?) been; especially with someone like Ramin Djawadi composing. I love a film with great music, so hopefully that improves as I watch the MCU expand.I know, I'm extremely late to this particularly party but happy to finally begin watching.","

"Iron Man","eric262003","20 April 2009","Of the top, my all time favourite superhero movie is the 1989 Batman, and my second favourite was the 1994 Alec Baldwin superhero movie ""The Shadow"" (the other ones seem to lack a certain formula that doesn't appeal to me very well).Not trying to be picky, but for a superhero film to work, isn't quite necessarily based on the excitement, the colours, the special gift our hero possesses or the colourful villains. It's fundamental priority is centered around the person behind the costume, the humanly characteristics our hero portrays. That in itself lures me into watching superhero action films. The superhero persona is only the frosting on the cake as to what drives the person behind the goals the character wishes to accomplish and the tactics he/she possesses and the dangers they encounter along the way of their quests.""Iron Man"" is an inspiration of how superhero movies should be made. The man behind the robot, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) suit represent raw emotion, real characterizations and a drive behind his motives. In addition to that, he is fun-loving, intelligent with just the right amount of quirkiness that is over-blown serious or overly silly. A great trait about the movie is that it isn't forced or rushed into the action scenes right away. ""Iron Man"" starts with the story behind Tony Stark and gradually it builds up the action. That way, it makes room for more further development as the story progresses. We can easily observe the dilemmas that Tony Stark is faced with and what he plans t do to overcome the obstacles that are upstaging him. Unlike other superhero films with cheesy dialog, in ""Iron Man"" the acting is surprisingly excellent. Downey is born to play this complex character, and succeeds rather well with his usual wit and low-key acting. It is by far the best I've seen since Michael Keaton in ""Batman"" and that was almost 20 years ago. His Tony Stark and the hardships he faces is convincing enough to sympathize with.Gwyneth Paltrow turns in another compelling performance as Tony Stark's loyal aide Pepper Potts. She provides a certain kind of charm and kindness that isn't just the female lead. Her facial expressions of concern and bewilderment speak more volumes than her voice (though her dialog was excellent too). Terrence Howard shines as Col. Rhodes, but I would've liked him to have more air time and better interactions between him and Stark, that might be my only criticism there. Plus Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the villain Obadiah Stane. The special effects are amazingly stunning in a way that it doesn't usurp the dialog like in many superhero moves. It succeeds in it being even balanced and avoids the cheese factor immensely. Last year I went to the theaters expecting to see another cheap-thrilling superhero action blockbuster, boy it was one of those rare moments where I was glad I was wrong. It was everything I ever hoped for in a superhero movie. Especially the development of the man behind the suit rather than the Iron Man himself. Stay tuned next year folks, the long-awaited sequel is coming soon. Get your tickets while they last. Get that camera rolling Jon Favreau.","

It has great pacing and lots of action. The build up of the characters is good, at least enough that you care to see what happens to them.This is a great movie that is worthy of rewatching. I was sad to see how quickly the hero franchise went downhill but at least I will always have this one to fall back on.","

"Iron Man","taylorkingston","26 May 2015","I really love this movie. It's a great beginning to an awesome series of movies. This movie is about Tony Stark. Genius. Billionaire. Playboy. Philanthropist. He is the son of a legendary inventor of weapons, and after his death, Tony continued on with his Father's work. But one day, when demonstrating a new weapon in the Middle East, he his kidnapped. He is forced to build his weapons for terrorists, but what he really does is build a suit that he controls. Then he beats the crap out of everyone, escapes, goes home, and continues to save the world as Iron Man. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.","

"Iron Man","ccthemovieman-1","10 October 2008","Simply put, this was a very entertaining movie.Despite the movie running a little long for an intense, action movie, overall it was still very interesting and fun to watch because the pacing was so good. Neither the action segments nor the lulls, the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but, frankly, what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a ""kids"" movie made today. Thankfully, that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent ""Transformers"" film I viewed.The scenes with ""Iron Man"" a.k.a. ""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance, catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot, piloted by the corporate bad guy ""Obadiah Stane"" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see, too.Some complain the film is not really all that ""smart"" and it's a bit too predictable, but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters. Speaking of characters, it wasn't easy to recognize Bridges with a bald head and full beard but once I heard his distinctive voice, I knew who it was. Gywneth Paltrow played a sweet role as Stark's loyal secretary, ""Pepper Potts."" (Nice name!!). The Afghanistan villain was credible. Actually, I liked him better than the obnoxious Liberal news reporter, who was annoying.The ""moral"" of the story the screenwriters preach is that military might as a deterrent to fighting terrorists can easily backfire as companies which manufacture arms for the U.S. could also be acquired by bad guys (because of greedy and corrupt U.S. businessmen). This is naive Liberal propaganda, the kind I would expect out of the movie industry, whether in Hollywood or Europe. Sadly, there will never be a shortage of bullies and evil people, who will then crush an unarmed foe as the people in this film attempt to do. It's also implausible any company like the one shown in this movie could so easily travel to a hot spot like Afghanistan and deal with terrorists. It's unrealistic, but that's today's movies for you. Also, despite the nonviolent message in the story, the good guy sure wipes out his share of people with a variety of weapons! For someone preaching peace, he sure didn't hesitate in killing opponents.Iron Man's metal suit is definitely very cool, equipped with about anything you'd need to fight an army of terrorists, or anyone else. The suit - and his super pacemaker - turn him into a Superman-type guy in that he can fly pretty high and pretty high. The latter part - how high he could fly - makes a nice conclusion, by the way, regarding the good guy's battle against the ""bad Iron Man.""","

"Iron Man","zetes","4 May 2008","A good superhero movie, but I'm more than a little shocked at the insanely good reviews it's gotten. Perhaps I'm just getting sick of the superhero movie formula, at least the initial installments of them. Same old same old, really. The only real positive element of the movie is Robert Downey Jr., who plays himself as he pretty much always does. If you don't like the actor, you'll find the movie torturous. I love him, personally, and was happy enough watching him do his thing with a few big action sequences adding some spice. And you've got to appreciate the casting of Jeff ""the Dude"" Bridges as a super villain (kind of a spoiler, I suppose, but if you don't see that coming you're a bonehead). Favreau finds a way to make Bridges enormous and intimidating in every shot, even while riding a Segway, which is a triumph of some sort. But, really, what does Iron Man provide that no other superhero movie has before? I certainly don't see it. The character is actually pretty boring, as are all the supporting characters. Are we now raving merely because of competency?","

"Iron Man","FiendishDramaturgy","30 April 2008","I have to ask ... Who better to play a middle-aged, wrung-out, loser than Robert Downey, Jr.? I say that with the utmost fondness, however, as I loved the IronMan comics as a kid, and I've never minded Robert Downey, Jr. as an actor. But in this role, he seems to have found his niche. I hope this run lasts for YEARS and gives Downey the inner Zen he needs to finish out his career with some pride.Going back to the origins, as in ""Batman Begins,"" and a plethora of other comic book-to-movie lines (Check out upcoming X-Men ""Origins"" movies, ""Wolverine,"" and ""Magneto.""), seems to be the best formula for launching a new franchise, or breathing new life into a dead one. It certainly worked for Batman and Spiderman, and I'm sure it will work with audiences this time, even though IronMan is a ""lesser"" character who usually stands in the background vying for his 15 seconds of screen time. I am happy to say that Downey and a respectable budget resolves that condition and elevates this franchise to something more desirable and far more reverent than many other comic book attempts on film.Downey really seems to connect with this character, and Gwyneth Paltrow is so funny as Pepper Potts. Yes, she's sexy, too, but she's FUNNY and so is Downey. I do believe audiences the world over will subscribe to this newly resurrected Marvel superhero in that he is completely human. You get Tony Stark, warts and all, and Downey plays him that way. He comes off so at ease in this part that it seems he was engineered specifically for this role.All in all? It may be a little too risquÃ© (in places) and violent (in others) for the kiddies, but the rest of humanity should LOVE it. It is gritty and holds some thread of reality, which weaves itself throughout, although I must say that the finale is a bit tepid. It left something to be desired in the big finish and felt a tad anticlimactic. Still awesome, though.And the toys ... there are loads of gadgets, toys, and comfortably spun one-liners. This is a story-driven, blockbuster-y , KABOOM flick with very little popcorn-ery to be had, although this IS an effects BLOW OUT of a comic book flick! It features a slick production style, top notch film quality, and a superb screen play. This superhero endeavor seems to be the birth of a new (and great) franchise, and I certainly hope it will not be the last. Indeed, there are hints as to another story line for a possible sequel. Did you notice?It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.","

"Iron Man","TxMike","29 October 2008","A really, really good comic book action movie. The snappy dialog, good acting, and good directing make all the difference.I've always enjoyed Robert Downey Jr., even in his TV roles, and here he carries the movie as Tony Stark, boy genius and inventor who after his father's death gains control of the biggest corporation making missiles and other machines of war. Tony continues what his father had built, and takes it a few steps further with his own inventions.Another actor I always like is Terrence Howard, and here he is long time friend of Tony's, and a military officer, Rhodey.Tony's right hand man in his company is Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. He had run the company while Tony was still growing up and seems to want to continue his expanded role.Good as Tony's trusty personal assistant is Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. She is not only a loyal employee but also a sort of ""pal"" to Tony, yet it seems that she wishes there were more between them.The story centers on an incident where Tony had travels to a war zone to demonstrate to the US military their newest weapon. But there is a motorcade attack and Tony gets imprisoned, with the demand that he develop the new weapon for them. Instead he invents something new, a rather crude iron man suit that he eventually uses to break free. But the experience changes him, as he sees that even the enemy have weapons that his company makes. His big decision when back home is to quit making weapons and instead concentrate on helping humanity.SPOILERS: When back home Tony works hard to perfect a sleek new Iron Man suit, one that can fly anywhere and even at supersonic speeds, and that has exotic weapon and navigational capabilities. In the process he has Pepper track down through company records how enemies were getting weapons. It turns out to be Obadiah, who is trying to get Tony killed so that he can run the corporation and enrich himself further with illegal weapons sales. The climax comes when Obadiah gets into a larger, more powerful iron man suit, and he and Tony battle. With Pepper's help he overcomes Obadiah, and in a conference reveals that he, Tony, is indeed the Iron Man.","

"Iron Man","oneguyrambling","30 October 2010","I know that it is fairly well documented by now, but apparently Robert Downey Jr wasn't supposed to play Tony Stark / Iron Man, now that I've watched it a couple times I can't imagine anyone else having a crack at it.I'm not a comic book guy, I read comics as a kid, but more Donald Duck vs the Beagle Boys stuff. I never got into The Phantom or Captain America stuff, in fact everything I knew about Iron Man I learned from listening to Ghostface Killah albums, hardly a lengthy study. Tony Stark is yet another creation of Stan Lee, the man responsible for seemingly half of the big budget movies of the last decade, and Stark has a good backstory.Tony Stark was born into money, but it helps that he is a creative genius also. Hardly a shrinking violet or a reclusive inventor, he does what everyone (at least thinks) they would do if in a position to do so. He bangs supermodels, often two or more at a time, drives fast cars and spreads his money around.He is witty, smart, sophisticated, vain and a little flawed, a description that also exactly suits RD Jr, casting him was probably the smartest move that was made, and allowed Iron Man to be strong enough to be mentioned in the same breath as the new Batman movies, although it is in my opinion just a minor notch below both.What Iron Man isn't, is derivative or indulgent, when the credits roll and everyone walks away happy it is a feeling well earned.Tony Stark is the head of Stark Industries, a massive company responsible for creating and manufacturing the best weapons on the planet. You know, ""When it comes to spreading fear, 9 out of 10 terrorists prefer Stark Industries weapons."" The movie gets right into the action, Stark is traveling with a military escort after a weapons demonstration when the convoy comes under fire. Most if not all soldiers are killed, and Stark is sent flying by one of his own weapons.Oh the irony! When he comes to, he has been taken hostage and thanks to a fellow prisoner who happens to be a doctor has a magnet strapped to his chest to prevent shards of shrapnel burrowing into his heart and killing him. The terrorists, realizing who they have in their hands, demand Stark build a superweapon for them using all the tools at their disposal. Instead of doing this Stark builds a metallic suit, the bulky and unwieldy ""Mark 1"".Using the Mark 1 Stark escapes, amazingly the suit takes a huge amount of direct fire, some near misses by rocket launchers, but literally explodes when it crashes into a sand dune on its maiden flight.Regardless, once Stark gets back to captivity he decides to ""go straight"" and tells the press that Stark Industries is out of the weapons game, which shocks the hell out of Obadiah Steyn, the public face of the company when Stark is under the weather or out whoring it up.Stark's right hand man is Pepper Pots, his secretary who handles all the everyday running of his life and tries to make sure that he stays on the straight and narrow where possible. Gwenyth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots, and really doesn't have a great deal to do. He also has a good buddy in the military Col. Roads, a virtual butler named Jarvis and a couple of robotic assistants who are largely along for comic relief.The Mark 1 inspires Stark to hone his design, and he does so successfully after some amusing failed attempts. Once he completes and test drives the suit (which looks and performs in a cool manner), it obviously becomes sought after by various parties, most of them thinking naughty thoughts, and the rest of the film has Tony Stark fighting for truth justice and the American way, (or something similar).Downey Jr is quick witted and rarely shuts up, though he is never boring or annoying, Terrence Howard sorta sleeps through his role as Col. Roads, but as a hardened military man he is supposed to be calm and stoic I guess. Paltrow plays the role that only several thousand random interchangeable Hollywood women could play, and she seems bemused to even be there after a decade of so called ""serious"" stuff.The strangest thing is how old Jeff bridges looks with a bald head and a full beard, I had to remind myself that I was watching ""the Lebowski Dude"" but I must say he has an immaculately shaped head that look great bald, and played the almost Father figure to Tony Start quite well. There are some great setpieces, some snappy dialogue and quite a few more laughs than the Batman flicks, or a season of Two and a Half Men for that matter.The acid test: my wife watched Iron Man with me, all the way through, without once walking off in disgust or needing to ""Oh sure!"" her way through long scenes, which happens in quite a few action or guy movies that she has witnessed. I might take the ultimate challenge later this year and see if my Dad will sit through more than 15 minutes of this without leaving the house.The best part? I actually really look forward to Iron Man 2 & 3, as opposed to say X-Men or Spiderman when you know you'll watch the inevitable sequels but don't expect much.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. This is a very entertaining movie that also works as a serious film. That doesn't happen too often. So as long as Downey Jr is Stark and Favreau is directing, I'm aboard for the ride.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com","

You have to agree with me because The Dark Knight has brains, it's serious, and it's amazing. Iron Man is one of the best films ever, but The Dark Knight is the best film ever. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark, a cocky weapon builder who is held captive. He is forced against his will to make a weapon called The Jerico. Instead he builds a suit which is his one way ticket out of there. So he returns to L.A. and decides to shut down his business. Because he saw tons of people murdered by his weapons. His friends Pepper(Gweneth Paltrow), JIm Rohdes(Terrence Howard)and Obideiah(Jeff Bridges) are all surprised. Tony begins experimenting with his iron suits. He soon fights crime as Iron Man. Iron Man has amazing visual effects. To think it's directed by Jon Faverau. Everyone in Iron Man is great and I think Robert Downey Jr. deserved an Oscar nomination for this and his role in Tropic Thunder. This film boosted his career back up. Robert Downey Jr. is here to stay for a while. Iron Man 2 will be out on May 7, 2010 and I can't wait til it comes out.","

"Iron Man","DesertDogMedia","20 August 2014","Title: Iron ManCondensed Storyline: A billionaire, playboy, weapons maker called Tony Stark is kidnapped and held captive in the middle east, so he has to escape. He does so with his new battle suit, but there is a traitor close to him Notable Acting: This movie was the movie which secured Robert Downey Jr in Hollywood, after having a troubled life prior to this movie, filled with substance abuse and poor acting roles. But when it came to the 2008 movie Iron Man this made him an overnight success as it was his first blockbuster movie and paved the way for his acting career. He fits the role so perfectly, because he is able to act pretentious and stuck up like his character of Tony Stark is. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the secretary/love interest of Pepper Potts, her character was enjoyable, but felt more like a secondary character compared to that of a primary character. The same could be aid about Jeff Bridges who plays the big bad of Obadiah Stane in this movie. Costume: The costume of Ironman was made with a stunning mixture between CGI and practical effects, and in all honesty, that is the bet way they could have done it. Because if they had done it with all practically effects, it would have looked lacking of sorts. And if it was done with all CGI it possibly would have looked cheesy. So I think they got it as good as could be. Incorrect Science: The arc reactor is used to keep the shrapnel out of Tony's heart, yet Yinsen talks about the arc reactor running his heart, feels like a nudge to the audience there. US soldiers are trained to never stop while ambushed in a convoy. All US army HMMWVs are armoured, the shots shown in the ambush scene go right through the door and window, they wouldn't do that if it was armoured. They would also give such a wealthy man added protection if he was visiting a warzone. Ironman encounters icing on his first flight with the MK2, but with no visible moisture in the air or on Ironman, so the air around him would have to be around -30 to -40 for icing of that magnitude to form. Overall Feel: Before this movie Ironman was in the B-list heroes group, the guy normal people wouldn't know. But the nerds or fans of the Avengers comic would know him. But after this movie, he was thrown right up there with the best. I used to watch the Ironman cartoon in the 90's and I can say that this did it justice, they stayed close to the source material and made some adaptations here and there, but it was a great movie which allows Marvel to get a foot hold for their cinematic universe. Before this they only had Blade in the late 90's and Spiderman in the 2000's. But even Spiderman could have ruined this movie, by ending it's trilogy on a bad note with Spiderman 3.","

"Iron Man","helmutty","30 April 2008","The movie does live up to my expectation. Iron man is one of the best movie in 2008. It is good to see some rising star such as director Jon Favreau, who directed Elf and Zathura and acted as the sidekick of Matt Murdock in Daredevil, now directs a big marvel movie and I am glad that he manages it well. The acting is good, CGI is good too and there are couples of intense scenes. Not much of a disappointment. Even the few action scenes are managed well so as we would not feel bored or felt that its CGI make up for the few action scenes.The story: Tony stark is rich, a Playboy and a genius. He is having his perfect life until when a group of terrorists captures him and force him to make a powerful weapon they want. Shortly, Tony decides to build an amour to protect him while escaping. He escapes, he decides to upgrade the amour and uses it to protect people. Robert Downey Jr is a good choice to play Tony Stark. While all the others are good too. CGI is amazing, it makes Iron man flexible. It is one of the most intense marvel movie I saw and that is what that makes it good, awesome. There is pretty much humour too even when fighting.Overall: As I says, Iron man is one of the most intense marvel comic movie I ever saw, it is worth watching it in cinema. The CGI and the battle scenes are worth it and it makes up for the few action scenes. The story is intense. It should be the 1st at box office and will. This will leave you craving for more, it feels quite short although it is 2 hours and will want Iron man 2. This will be added to my best movies which includes Transformers. Now CGI is really realistic.","

"Iron Man","phubbs","18 November 2014","I admit, I was expecting this to be dreadful but I was wrong, its amazingly very good. The usual obvious origins story line of course with everything you tend to expect when a super heroic legend begins. The first thing that hit me was the suit, its sex on a stick for sure! it looks so so damn cool. The way it attaches itself to Downey and locks in place, the HUD display in the helmet, the weapons on the arm sections, its fantastic, finally there's a competitor to the Stormtrooper armour.This is what I wanna see for the next Robocop, but with a more violent tone of course. This movie shows what can be done if done right, how 'Transformers' could have looked, its very impressive indeed. Not only are the actual Iron Man suits extremely well made for real in certain sequences, but the CGI is top notch in other outlandish sequences. I'm no fan of CGI I won't deny but even this shocked me, I fully expected this film to look bad obvious plastic and fake, but bugger me if the CGI wasn't fudging amazing! Best damn CGI I've seen in ages, I loved the new shiny looking suit effects but I loved the battered scratched used CGI effects even more. It could of been so easy to keep everything looking nice sparkly and new, but like Star Wars the used universe works wonders and a beaten up Iron Man suit looks brilliant.The first action scene where Stark gets back at the terrorists that captured him is excellent, really action packed and gets you right into the action and wanting more. You really get behind Stark as he powers the terrorists through walls and takes them out with tiny missiles, superb intro for the suit with an awesome and highly grounded action sequence (wouldn't blame you for thinking any action was gonna be hokey).The finale battle with bridges character is a little silly and kinda loses that realistic feel, really goes into the comicbook realms and almost looks a bit like 'Transformers' at times *shudders!*. Its still handled well and of course looks excellent, much better than Bay's robot film as you can actually make out what's going on. Plus its not too over the top, it just about remains reasonably sensible...well as sensible as a comicbook action flick goes anyway.The cast is also spot on for once, Downey is great as Stark, his humour is dry witty sarcastic and does raise a giggle for the older audience members. Bridges does look powerful and evil as the bald villain, he has that deep thick voice which serves him well, didn't see quite enough of him being evil here. Paltrow was also OK, a little annoying with her screams all the time but I guess that's what heroines do in these type of films.There were a few bits I didn't get on with too well, when he's captured by the terrorists he makes his initial suit very quickly, a little too quickly maybe. At the end he refers to himself as Iron Man but this is never mentioned throughout, it just pops up at the end which is weird. Why does he tell the world he is Iron Man at the end? did he make up the name there and then? and why does he show the injury on his chest with a circular glow? surely that's just asking for trouble. Maybe these are things you know if your a fanboy. I would like to ask for no more bloody Stan Lee cameos, Jesus!...yes you made up the characters, we get it, get of your high horse already.Anyway, yes this was a great fun film for everyone to enjoy. Still very surprised it turned out so well and with such good looking CGI! Would have laid money on this being a childish poor looking mess. For once I am looking forward to a sequel.8/10","

"Iron Man","GusF","15 September 2015","The first entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this is a very fun and exciting superhero film which served as a great introduction to the title character. Although there are some pacing problems, the script is generally strong and it is well directed by Jon Favreau. I have been planning to watch the MCU films and TV series in full from the beginning for the ages and I finally took the plunge today. The only entry in the franchise that I have previously seen is ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" when it was first released in 2011. First of all, I should say that I have never really been terribly interested in Marvel and my knowledge of its characters comes almost exclusively through adaptations and by osmosis. I say ""almost"" since I think that I have read three Marvel comics in my life. As an indication of my Marvel ignorance, I had never even heard of their version of Thor or the Guardians of the Galaxy before their films were released. As such, I will be reviewing these films on their own merits since that it is all I can do, really.Robert Downey, Jr. gives a wonderful performance as Tony Stark, a playboy genius industrialist whose hugely successful company has made weapons for the US government for decades. He is dismissive of any suggestion that his work is in any way immoral. However, after being severely wounded by one of his own weapons and escaping from the clutches of an Afghani terrorist group called the Ten Rings, he sees things from a different perspective and announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons. Over the course of the film, Tony goes from being a self-obsessed businessman primarily concerned with drinking and gambling to a true hero of the old mould. However, the characterisation is so good that this transition seems entirely realistic, even with all the sci-fi trappings. I think that Tony was always a very good man. He just needed his eyes to be opened to the problems of the world around him and what he could do to fix them. He finally realised that creating weapons of mass destruction was not the way to solve said problems. Downey is never less than entirely convincing as Tony, who manages to keep his composure when others would be in a state of panic and has a sardonic remark for most situations. I love quirky, self-deprecating, conflicted characters and he is a great example of that.Gwyneth Paltrow is a good actress but she has certainly been better in other films where she had more interesting characters. Pepper Potts is in the film to be Stark's love interest and that's about it. She doesn't have many characteristics beyond the fact that she loves him and her major contribution to the plot is the requisite, though very entertaining, damsel in distress scenes. She is not a very strong character, I'm afraid, which is a shame as she is the only female character who appears in more than a few scenes. Theirs is also a pretty tepid romance. Jeff Bridges is excellent as Obadiah Stane, bringing his great talent to bear as the Stark Industries manager. While much of Stane's storyline was admittedly predictable, it was handled extremely well and there is a terrific sense of tension between Downey and Bridges for most of the film. Terrence Howard is great as Tony's best friend and military liaison Colonel James Rhodes and it is a shame that he did not return for any of the sequels. Shaun Toub gives one of the best performances in the film as Stark's fellow captive Yinsen - I thought that the character would be a villain when he was introduced but he turns out to be one of the most honest, decent characters in the film - while Farah Tahir is suitably creepy as the Ten Rings' leader Raza. As the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Paul Bettany has some great lines and his wry wit is a nice complement to Stark's. I loved the Stan Lee and Samuel L. Jackson cameos. Lee is such a legend that I have great affection for him even though I don't read Marvel Comics! The strongest scenes in the film are the ones in which Tony is held captive by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan and creates a rudimentary Iron Man suit out of scrap. I loved these scenes both because they were the perfect illustration of Tony's intelligence and resourcefulness and because Tony and Yinsen worked so well together. Speaking of Afghanistan, I really liked the manner in which the film handled the War on Terror. Its exploration of the morality of Tony's weapon systems was also very good. On the negative side, the film has some pretty serious pacing issues which last from Tony's rescue until his return to Afghanistan as Iron Man, which is about half an hour. Admittedly, these scenes were necessary for later on in the film but they were not terribly good or interesting. I often found myself bored during them, if I'm honest. However, the film rollicks along at a great pace from then until the end of the film. The battle scenes are hugely impressive, ""edge of your seat"" stuff, which is exactly what I want from a superhero film.Overall, this is an extremely good film which could have been an excellent one if it had not been for the aforementioned problems. I look forward to watching the rest of the films in the series.","

"Iron Man","pyrocitor","8 May 2008","With comic book films becoming an increasingly common component of the summer blockbuster season, the question emerges: how to make a mark as unique in the midst of so much superpowered competition while still holding true to the elements which made the originals such successes in the first place? It would seem director Jon Favreau has found the answer. From the opening chords of AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" it becomes instantly apparent that Iron Man is going to be a different kind of comic book movie. Instead of the filmmaker's usual aspirations to have the source material adapted as darker and grittier than its comic book origins could ever have been, Favreau is not afraid to embrace a very much needed sense of fun without descending into the rampant silliness which consumed Tim Story's Fantastic Four. As such, Iron Man essays a superb balance between embracing every last enjoyable detail while maintaining the gravitas and complexity of its original story and characters, a seamless melding of intelligence and action clout. What really sells the film is its intelligent script, with a series of astutely crafted lines a far cry from the usual clunking variety which could have been conceived by the average six year old boy. Favreau's Robert Altman influence also leads to some highly enjoyable improvisations on top of the scripted material (Downey Jr.'s exchanges with his robotic helpers are priceless). Similarly. by updating Stark's backstory from Vietnam to a more topical Afghanistan, the film has added political poignancy, making some intriguing tongue in cheek comments about the American military. While the occasional lapse in realism and occasionally conventional character motivations may prove problematic to some, such are easily excusable considering the medium from which the story is faithfully adapted, and Favreau's solid directing outweighs such inconsequential concerns with a sheer unabashed sense of enjoyment and unfiltered movie magic. Though the bulk of the story is dedicated to the usual origin tale, Favreau by no means skimps on the jaw-dropping action setpieces, generating some genuinely gripping and tense sequences (Stark's capture in Afghanistan is visceral and engrossing) as well as the requisite adrenaline pumping exhilarating ones - Stark's testing of his Mark One armour to escape captivity is full throttle entertainment and the final showdown is easily the show stopping setpiece of the year thus far. The film's flawless special effects are perfectly executed, used to full effect without ever swamping the picture. The Iron Man armour itself both looks and sounds brilliant, a clanking cacophony of assembled parts coming together for a heart pumping streamlined exterior. Similarly, the musical score, while not the most original, provides some suitably heroic themes and proves enthralling in its own right. Enough praise cannot be bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr., who, overcoming every last inch of apprehension over his casting, is by far the key element to Iron Man's standing out from the waves of other superhero films. Delivering one of the strongest performances in his formidable career, Downey Jr. effortlessly inhabits every last contradictory inch of Tony Stark like the pristine suits the character himself dons. Putting his own unorthodox spin on the character through his wisecracking, motormouthed energy, Downey Jr. still stays true to the spirit of Stark and his darker overtones, even making the transition from callous, arrogant billionaire weapons vendor to iron clad humanitarian feasible through his extraordinary charisma and gleaming, passionate intensity. To say that Downey Jr. is perfect for the role is an understatement; a testament to the use of quality actors for bringing immortalised comic book figures to life instead of ham-handed fresh young faces chosen for looks over talent. While the rest of the cast cannot quite match up to Downey Jr.'s dynamo of a performance, all prove equally adept in adapting their comic book incarnations in a plausible fashion. Terrence Howard delivers an appropriately curt dignity to Stark's military ally Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes, adding the perfect clipped acerbic deadpan to the character. Similarly, Gwyneth Paltrow makes a surprisingly convincing potential love interest as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts, her natural charisma and share of icy comebacks easily proving a superb foil to Downey Jr.'s livewire of a performance. Jeff Bridges moulds his usual laid back image into one of a despicably greedy businessman concealing his shockingly selfish dealings under a veneer of oily respectability, his unconventional performance easily overcoming the trappings of his otherwise conventional villain figure. Shaun Toub is charming as Yinsen, the mysterious scientist who saves Stark's life in Afghanistan and helps him construct his first suit of armour, with Toub's irreverent edge preventing the role from becoming a stock ""mentor"" figure. Simply put, Iron Man is everything a comic book movie could hope to be: a perfect balance between the grittily serious and exuberantly enjoyable, flawless special effects and a roster of incredible performances. Iron Man proves an example of the quintessential blockbuster: one not afraid to think while simultaneously bludgeoning with entertainment - for those in search of entertainment without jeopardising brain cells, Iron Man should prove just the thing. -10/10","

"Iron Man","the-gossip-king","17 April 2008","Lets face it. Iron Man is not the most famous of comic superheroes. In fact, up until now I had only head about it briefly. I also found out that it was from Marvel and since I love Spiderman so much I decided I would go and check it out. Wow! This movie is awesome!. Acting is great and I am so happy to see Gwyneth Paltrow back in the movie business after a while. Robert Downey junior was also really good as the sleazy millionaire turned superhero. The villain was great (i forget his name) and Terrence Howard was great as well. The action and visual effects were really good and the movies talk on terrorism is very intriguing. Overall, a great movie. I think Marvel should be very pleased.","

"Iron Man","Danusha_Goska","18 May 2008","""Iron Man""'s best feature is its cast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terence Howard, Clark Gregg and Shaun Toub are all serious actors who have been in actually good movies. They can afford to slum in drek like this. They don't slum, though. All of them act up a storm, as if the script were actually worth something. Good for them. Robert Downey Jr. is fascinating to watch, and Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable and appealing as something of a female lead (remember, this is a movie for boys.) Otherwise, though, ""Iron Man"" is not one of those comic book movies like the Christian Bale ""Batman"" or the over the top, guilty pleasure ""300"" that transcends its genre. ""Iron Man"" is an obvious, pathetic fantasy for men and boys who are insecure because they feel unattractive, weak, stupid, and incompetent. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is granted superhuman powers of intelligence, sex appeal, and power. The movie, heavy-handed and obvious, announces, within the first five minutes, that Tony Stark had sex with all of Maxxim's cover models, and, presumably as part of his super powers, he apparently did not contract one social disease by doing so. Stark goes on to seduce a woman who hates him, and, again this is all within the first few minutes. He stiffs his friend to play dice in Vegas, he flies his private jet around the world, and, in a cave, using scrap metal and an open fire, he invents a wearable suit that resists close range automatic weapons fire. He also, for some reason, inserts a glowing device, that looks a lot like a smoke detector, into his chest. Tony lives in a spectacular house in Malibu, he parks shiny sports cars where the camera will be sure to see them, and a train of white, black, young, and old sycophants follow him around, complimenting his every move. Gee, Tony, you're a genius. Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, whatever. Even within the boundaries of comic book movies, none of this is believable, and it's frightening to think of the childlike minds that will find it appealing.The movie lacks a strong narrative drive. Tony's agenda, his enemies, his location, and even his Iron Man suit, change too often. The movie is chopped into episodic bits. The plot twists are not surprising.","

"Iron Man","Turfseer","10 May 2008","This is basically 'Robocop' updated to 2008. Except it's nowhere as good as that film. The '87 thriller is set in the future with an equally implausible scenario, but far more intriguing: the body of a murdered police officer is used to create a robot who still retains traces of the dead man's memories. The core of Iron Man is plain silly: set in the present time, the iron man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) must prance around with some kind of magnet implanted in his chest cavity, preventing shrapnel from puncturing his heart. Then, he invents an iron suit which enables him to fly at supersonic speeds and kill terrorists without suffering serious injury. Like Robocop, a computer interface is suggested inside the 'mask' of both superheroes; but in Robocop the hero is haunted by the memories of the dead man whose body was used to create him.There is no such internal tension in Iron Man. It's strictly a good guy-bad guy shoot 'em up. Downey plays Stark, the head of a large corporation which manufactures weapons. Stark is depicted as an arrogant playboy who takes no precautions when he travels around in a Humvee in Afghanistan. He ends up being captured by a local warlord and his crew of motley insurgents and realizes that they have been using his company's weapons to fight US troops. Now he suddenly has a change of heart and uses his skills (he's a genius!) to create an iron man outfit to escape the bad guys (they think he's working on a missile).When he returns to the US, he decides to utilize the prototype of the iron man outfit he created in Afghanistan to become a superhero fighting for good. A good part of the film is taken up with Downey designing the new Iron Man outfit; during the 'testing phase' he gets thrown against the walls of his laboratory numerous times (how exciting!). Finally, he starts flying through the air with this metal suit on and almost crashes when he goes too high up in the atmosphere and his suit gets frozen with ice (funny how he wasn't smart enough to invent some kind of deicing device contained on most commercial aircrafts).Terrence Howard (of 'Hustle & Flow' fame) isn't doing much hustling and flowing here in a do-nothing part as an army liaison officer for the munitions company. Similarly Gwyneth Paltrow, Stark's personal assistant, engages in a great deal of pointless banter leading to a non-romantic moment at the film's denouement. Jeff Bridges probably has the best part as Downey's partner in the multinational corporation who ends up betraying him and working with the warlords and terrorists in Afghanistan. But how did he so easily get past the alarm system or other security devices in Downey's home? You would think that breaking into a home like that wouldn't be so easy.In the end, there is the obligatory battle between the two machines (done much better in Teriminator 2). Bridges looks ridiculous when he takes off his metal helmet and all you see is his face inside the metal contraption. I fail to see why so many critics gave this film good marks. It's strictly a film for uneducated teenagers who read comic books all day. It also serves to lull people in this country into a false sense of security vis-a-vis the terrorist threat. By creating an invincible 'Iron Man"" who can easily mow down terrorists and bad guys, it makes us forget that the bad guys in real life are not so easily defeated. Case in point: 9/11. The only winners here are the actors who collected nice paychecks for participating in such a cheesy and worthless venture.","

"Iron Man","RainDogJr","30 April 2008","I'm a casual reader of comic books so definitely I'm not the biggest fan of the Marvel world and I don't know all the details of every Marvel story. Anyway, I do like a lot superheroes and of course their enemies (sometimes even more) but definitely Iron Man is not my favourite, probably is Spider-Man. But since I knew that they were making this film I was kind of exciting, of course for the cast too, about it and for me it was really quick it's release. The fact that it doesn't have the big publicity of films like ""Spider-Man 3"" or the upcoming ""The Dark Knight"" (even ""Speed Racer"" in those days has a bigger publicity with all kind of products), was also good but even with less publicity they just make a good damn thing for their business making it's release today, the day of the children in Mexico and also selling the fact that in the US it doesn't opens until the next Friday. So here I'm writing about it just after returning from the theater after enjoyed a lot this great picture.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is just a genius of technology but also a bastard. He is the ultimate designer of weapons and his company is really powerful but dealing with this kind of clients will be always dangerous. Suddenly he reborn, finally opening his eyes and waking up from a dream full of parties, women and power to realize that he was providing amazing technology to the wrong persons. He is IRON MAN. That story about the present situation with the war is really good having in Stark the kind of businessman who never cares about anything but his company's interests. Definitely this background is not important for a child but of course there is great action and great visuals. And there are many funny things especially for a really cool Downey Jr. and his character's attitude before his experiences with the terrorists. Talking about the cast, I think Downey Jr. is really good for the main role as Stark and as Iron Man, well anybody could look really cool with a suit like that. The Dude, Jeff Bridges, is also a good villain and the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow is just perfect in all the ways.Conclusion: ""Iron Man"" is a great pre-summer film, for me much better than the recent Marvel adaptations. I loved the trailer for Black Sabbath's Iron Man and here the closing titles are just terrific (Back in Black is also great but some other music in the film is not) but damn I didn't wait until the very end (but definitely I could watch it again) and now I know that Samuel L. Jackson is also here. F*ck right now I hate him mostly because his story with Troma but that's another story. Anyway I really enjoyed this film and of course I'm ready for the next chapter, maybe the second of 15. It's only the decision of the studio because Downey Jr. is more than ready!","

"Iron Man","colonel_green","1 May 2008","It'll take another viewing to confirm, but we may possibly have reached Nerdvana with this movie (incidentally, we got a trailer for The Dark Knight, but it was the teaser they initially released; meh; also, there was the Incredible Hulk teaser, which people seemed to like). I got into comics through the animated adaptations of things like Spider-Man and X-Men, so I only knew of Iron Man from his appearances in the 90s Spidey cartoon for a while. Recently, though, you can't throw a rock in the Marvel Universe without hitting Tony Stark, and I've been following the excellent current run by Charles and Daniel Knauf, as well as his appearances in other titles like Captain America, and reading the collected editions of his classic stories.Looking only at the plot, this is a pretty standard origin film; we get the modern version of Tony's beginnings as detailed by Warren Ellis in ""Extremis"" (with Afghanistan instead of Vietnam), and Pepper Potts is Tony's Girl Friday, though otherwise this is strongly influenced by the Layton/Michelinie period, particularly the presence of James Rhodes as the lead male supporting character, the main villain, Obadiah Stane (he doesn't last enough to be christened the Iron Monger formally, though he uses the term in conversation earlier), and Tony's immediate motivation for becoming a superhero, which is modelled heavily on ""Armour Wars"". But it's the execution, the details, and, yes, the Downey Jr., that make all the difference. Robert Downey Jr. owns all, no doubt; he's utterly fantastic as Tony Stark. Jeff Bridges is very strong as Stane; he's up there with McKellen and Defoe as realizing the best film villains of the current revival. At first I was a bit put off by Terrence Howard's voice as Rhodey (softer than I had imagined; in my head he's always been more of a Dorn/Haysbert type), but he's good; Paltrow does a good job too.The film is peppered with setup for future stuff: SHIELD (and, if you stay after the credits, ole Nick himself, talking about his ""Avenger Initiative""), an expansive terrorist network referred to as the ""Ten Rings"" (of the Mandarin), and, my favourite, Rhodey vowing ""next time, baby"" on seeing a silver-grey suit of Iron Man armour.Mild criticism might be that the final defeat of the Iron Monger is vague and not especially climactic, but it suits the purpose well enough, and the preceding fight between the two armoured knights is awesome.10/10.","

"Iron Man","Al_The_Strange","3 May 2015","By 2008, there were already a bunch of Marvel movies on the market, all presented as a big mixed cluster of varying quality and quantity. After pulling itself together as its own studio, Marvel kicked off Phase 1 of its new movie-making universe with Iron Man.From start to finish, this is one cool film. It is very sharply-made, with a very slick and high-quality look and feel. It's evenly-paced, with equal parts color, comedy, and action. And when the action hits, it is really cool stuff, without going too far overboard. Among Iron Man's heroics, my favorite scene shows him rocketing to the other side of the world, to use his high-tech suit to beat up violent extremists to protect the innocent (blowing up a tank in the process, before being pursued by American jets in a great high-speed air chase scene). The film's climax features an all-out fight between two high-powered suits, during which there's plenty of mass destruction. Even when there aren't guns and rockets going off, the film is still a blast with its colorful inter-character exchanges, funny suit-testing scenes, tense inter-corporate conspiracies.The story this film tells is a great one. The origins of Iron Man is inherently compelling, as it takes a greedy, narcissistic arms dealer and flips him on his head to turn him into a hero. The film does so by plunging the character into the heart of the very problems he's created (in a war-town part of the world nonetheless). Once Tony Stark dedicates himself to being Iron Man, the conflict shifts to him confronting everybody else around him. Through all the struggles he endures, the film lays out rich characterization and interesting thematic material worth exploring.This film looks splendid, with quality photography and editing. Acting is quite spot-on: Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as the title character, and he remains iconic through every other Marvel project he's in from here on out. Gweneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Shaun Toub, and everybody else is great to watch as well. Writing is pretty good and sharp. This production uses spectacular-looking sets, props, and costumes. Most special effects hold up well, and are awesome to behold. Ramin Djawadi's music score is pretty cool too.The first Iron Man film has everything you can ask for in a superhero film: thrilling action, amusing humor, a decent story, and characters we can care about. Even after having numerous other Marvel films come out since, this is still the biggest must-see of the lot.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)","

"Iron Man","RyanCShowers","5 August 2013","Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN (2008)I'm not a fan of superhero-origin stories, but with the original Iron Man, I never felt like the filmmakers woke up and said ""Let's Make a Superhero movie!"" What the film implies the director and stars felt like when they started each day of filming is ""Let's make the best movie we can make."" Iron Man doesn't meander in scenes that are purely self-serving to remind everyone we're watching a superhero movie. Though it has its comic-booky undertones, Iron Man instead is an impacting, polished, and enthralling film about a man who finds redemption in an unconventional way. It's not about the ""superhero"", it's about the process of becoming a hero. It's enjoyable spectacle, but also has a lot to offer its genre intellectually and creatively. Iron Man fits together as tightly as Gwyneth Paltrow's calves and is as clever as Downey's comebacks. While never feeling established as a genre picture, it fulfills every expectation you could have going in. Rating: 8/10Grade: A-I couldn't discuss the Iron Man films without paying respect to the comparison between this series and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series. I find the original Iron Man to introduce the story and develop it's characters better, even if it may lack the craftsmanship of Batman Begins. Nolan got the more impressive sequels, however. Contrast. Anyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. ""I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow"" said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.","

"Iron Man","Shad_Critic","5 March 2015","First of all, Iron Man is truly awesome! Every scene was great and there was almost no boring parts in the movie. Iron Man is the best out of the three. Iron Man 2 was boring and Iron Man 3 was just disappointing. Iron Man was a part where the Marvel Cinematic Universe began. And yes, it was a good start. But the sad part is the last 2 movies left a legacy of mediocrity. At least it had the chance to redeem itself through the movie The Avengers. Maybe, Iron Man would redeem itself again on Avengers Age Of Ultron.In conclusion, Iron Man was great! A good start to the franchise and the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.","

"Iron Man","Merklin","8 July 2008","In the last couple of years, comic book based super hero movies have had a mission to accomplish and thats kick starting a franchise.The likes of Fantastic four, batman begins, daredevil and hulk to name a few, were made to be the start of a series. Iron man is no different, but where many of these sorts of films fail, Iron Man succeeds because it not only gets the series started but its a damn good film in its own right.Exciting, funny and well acted, iron man is an all round great effort that sticks surprisingly close to its source material. The high octane sequences where iron man soars through the air and kicks bad guys asses are awesome to watch but thankfully this is a film where things are just as interesting to watch when no one is blowing anything up and its all thanks to the Jon Favreau careful direction. The plot, in which billionaire tony starks turns from brash playboy to amour clad hero, is engaging and enthralling and favreaus eye for great acting ensures some great naturalistic performances.There are two stand out performances, the first and most important being Robert Downey Juniour as Tony Stark. Junior makes this role his own, injecting Tony Stark with a sense of cool, arrogance and an Errol Flynn like swagger that makes him really fun to watch and get behind as a leading man. The second (which surprisingly doesn't get as much praise as Downeys stark) is Jeff Bridges as bad guy Obadiah Stane. Although he could have played the role as a scenery chewing , typical villain, Bridges injects the role with a sense of realism and imposing menace, making for a convincing antagonist.Iron Man is what a marvel comic book movie should be- a mix of great story ,exciting action, and a faithful representation of a classic character.","

"Iron Man","smg242","20 June 2014","1000th review!!! Spoilers, though!The 2008 Iron Man movie is one that I consider to be one of the best of its genre. I mean, you've got the laid-back, smooth direction of Jon Favreau, a GREAT villain played by Jeff 'Lebowski' Bridges, a tight, yet simplistic but hard-hitting plot, and to top it all, the charisma and nuance of Robert Downey Jr. as billionaire Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. Pepper all that with fantastic special effects and CGI.I've doubted Marvel in the past, I thought Daredevil was pretty bad, and the Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider movies were bad. Also, the third parts of the X-Men and Blade movies sucked. But they nailed it with this one. I can't really explain how I instantly fell in love with it. It's like some of the 80s kids and the '89 Batman movie. It just has that sort of charm!Speaking of Batman, this movie came out as the same year as The Dark Knight. While TDK is clearly the better film, I still prefer this one over it. Maybe it's because Batman acted like a p*ssy following TDK, and went into 'exile'. Whereas, Stark publicly announces that he's Iron Man in this movie.Thank you, Marvel, for starting off the stellar Avengers universe with this fantastic film.","

"Iron Man","owen-watts","16 October 2020","The faltering babysteps of the ginormous MCU lie in this deeply uneven late noughties superhero venture. Downey Jr is, of course, a charismatic presence but he eats too much screen time and literally no one else gets a look-in or any real motivation. The crass boyish sexism and heavy-handed ""vague terrorist group"" have dated appallingly but the suit is the star and the sleek Stan Winston/ILM fusion still feels vibrant. It's definitely a mixed bag rather than a strong foundation but the building blocks are there and the weight of where it all leads lends it a far more tolerable aspect.","

"Iron Man","tindfoting","28 May 2022","It's hard to imagine now, 12 years later, Marvel took a CHANCE on the ""not so famous as Spider-Man"", greenlighting the still very popular comic book Iron Man. Hiring Robert Downey jr was probably the boldest move, the actor being a part of the brat pack with a seriously long list of drug charges and Betty Ford visits. But it worked! Downey plays the snarky, irritating Tony Stark to A+ in my book, being a truly prominent warmonger... until he isnt. Later, being captured by some Afghan guerilla (probably with good reason, since Stark provides weapons), he proves his brilliance by making Iron Man suit Mark I. I dug how mechanical and primitive it all looked. Compared to a dozen years later, IM 1 looks refreshingly more old school technically, and Jon Fevrau has no rush really to show us all the action. This is more a redemption story about Tony Stark, coming to terms not only with how he (and his dad) has become billionairs, but also his own mortality (that splinter that's inches from his heart). Off course, the 3rd part of the movie goes all in CGI, with a weak villain in Jeff Bridges (I love him, but here he is way OTT). In the end a very good intro too the everlasting MCU. With AC/DC and the immortal line in the end; ""I am Iron Man"". The 1st was also the best of the trilogy.","

"Iron Man","tedg","2 May 2008","I did not expect much from this. Marvel just seems to make what seems to me ordinary, boring movies. I was hopeful this time because the three main actors have done some rather elaborate work so far as reflected acting. Downey is something of a prince at this business of simultaneous personalities.But we have none of that here. I just saw ""Forbidden Kingdom"" and it uses what is now the state of the art regarding cameras in fights: the camera dances. It folds us into the action. Not so with any Marvel-produced project. We might as well be watching C D deMille with color.Nearly all these Marvel stories are predicated on science gone wrong. Contrast that to heroes from other companies, where it is just cosmic reality or even training that happens to make someone special. But these stories all derive from the Japanese pattern of postwar antiscience movies which in turn were based on ""Frankenstein."" (The Japanese would not have known the earlier gollum films.)So the driving force here is science. As it happens, I would have been disappointed by the blandness of everything, but they ruined the driving force of science for me. Stark was supposed to have gone to MIT with Colonel Rhodes (who wears an MIT ring), but we are told Stark was summa cum laude at MIT. But that school is unique in never engaging in that foolishness. Think about it.But what's a greater offense is how this, the man with the best mind, the most money and the most advanced science, does his work. I'm thinking particularly of the computers. This is the one place where we could have been dazzled. But what we see is ordinary, as if it were envisioned not by a man with great imagination and inventiveness, but by someone who simply doesn't know.Suppose you were shown a car from 50 years in the future and it had a key, steering wheel and dial speedometer. Its the same effect, and sorta takes the gas out of the thing.Oh, they made Gwyneth a redhead.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","

This leads Obadiah Stane (Played by Jeff Bridges) to begin questioning his mind.With help from Pepper Potts (Played by Gwyneth Paltrow) his assistant to help keep his affairs in order at Stark Industries along with his best friend Rhodey (Played by Terrence Howard).The plot of the film is one of the strong holds to Iron Man as it explain how Tony Stalk would become Iron Man and any fan of Iron Man would appreciate itWhile I wasn't sure much about Robert Downey Jr but after watching Iron Man it was clear he was born to play this role his performance in this film shows you can pull yourself out of a jam and become better and this film show case his talents as a actor because he brought Tony Stark to life on the big screen.Jeff Bridges went so far as to shaving his head bald like Obadiah in the comic books because he wanted to make sure he made the fans happy by looking like the character from the comics which is true to honoring the craft of acting.Gwyneth did pretty well as Pepper as in terms of her services to the role. The acting in the film is pretty strong as you see the cast pulling out the best of their talents to the film and there is a good bit of humor in the film.Action for this film is some of the best ever done in a film and some of the most creative as well you have to see the film to appreciate it Music wise is pretty awesome as it include Black Sabbath ""Iron Man"" along with other original music to tell the story of each scene.The Special effects in the film are top notch the suits for Iron Man are very well design and detail as it shows the power of how C G I can be done for any film.Iron Man does a very well done film with story telling, acting and amazing special effects if you want to appreciate a good comic book movie watch Iron ManI give Iron Man an 9 out of 10","

"Iron Man","Rage-Kage","15 June 2014","I have been a big fan of superhero movies every since I was 8 and the first Spiderman movie came out however I was not much of a movie fan overall until The Avengers was released in 2012. So that being said when Iron Man was first released I didn't really care. I did however see the Hulk because unlike Iron Man I had heard of him before because of the 2003 Hulk movie. I finally saw this movie in 2010 right before the release of Iron Man 2 nd have been a fan ever since. I actually did not know that all of these Marvel movies were part of the same universe until about 6 months before The Avengers was released and ever since finding that out I have been immersed into this amazing movie world that Marvel has set up.Everybody knows the plot to this movie so I don't need to go into detail. Tony Stark is taken prisoner by terrorists he creates Iron Man and escapes and beats the bad guys. It's really awesome to see Iron Man just flying around. In 2008 especially because there had not really been anything like it in a superhero movie before. The way it looks when it flys or in combat it's like watching an actually piece of advanced weaponry entering a war zone. One thing in particular that is really cool to see in this movie is Tony Stark using every possible available resource including his own mind to his advantage. Everything from first building the Iron Man suit to actually using it does a great job showing that Tony Stark is a genius. He proves even this early on in the MCU that he is Iron Man with or without the suit.The acting like everything else is of course great especially form Robert Downey Jr. Which was of course a big surprise considering he had been on the down slope for at least 10 years prior to the release of this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow did a good job as Pepper Potts though I don't particularly like her as an actor. I don't have anything against her I'm just not a big fan but with that in mind she did a good job throughout the entire trilogy as well as in her short appearance in The Avengers. Her and Robert Downey Jr. work really well together and have a good believable relationship in these movies. Terrence Howard did an OK job as Rhodey but I personally like Don Cheadle a lot more. Of course you can't go wrong with Jeff Bridges in anything so I don't even need to talk about him but I will say he makes a great villain.So overall Iron Man is a great and really entertaining movie as well as the start of an amazing universe of movies. If you've somehow managed not to see Iron Man yet... why? Between all the easter eggs from comics and other movies the tie ins and the superhero awesomness there is no reason for any comic book or movie fan to be left out of this truly amazing world that Marvel has created.I give Iron Man a 10/10","

"Iron Man","jerekra","11 June 2009","Iron Man is a Marvel Film that is better than many other Marvel Films that I have seen recently.Tony Stark is kidnapped while he is over seas demonstrating some new weapons for the military. Once captured, he is forced to build a bomb but instead he builds a suit that he uses to escape from his kidnappers. As he returns home Stark decides that he must stop his company from manufacturing weapons and also begins to build a new suit that he can use to fight against evil.A major strength to this film is a strong lead character who plays the role greatly. In Spiderman I felt that they could have chosen a better actor to play Spiderman but I think that Robert Downey Jr. is great at portraying Tony Stark. Stark comes off as intelligent, funny, and in complete control in this film. Downey Jr. was a great choice as Iron Man and I look forward to seeing him in the sequel.The Iron Man suit in this film is awesome. The effects are phenomenal and outstanding at the same time. Especially the scenes where Iron Man is flying around. This really is some of the best special effects that I have seen in a film and it makes every scene involving Iron Man marvelous.I think the story is good as well. It is not too complex like another super hero film that came out the same summer. (Dark Knight) THe story picks up right away and the main conflict is upon the audience very soon. Also I like how you do not go through all of Tony Starks life and how he is given a brief back story at the beginning. This helps the story to get going.A few minor problems. For one, you really have to wait a while before Stark makes the real Iron Man suit. However I do understand that this is the film where they needed to show how the suit gets built and so on. You just have to wait a while to see Stark in the final awesome looking suit.Also I think Iron Man could have been in it a little more. It is cool seeing Tony Stark a lot, but it would have been nice to see him in the Iron Man costume more.The action is good in this film, but nothing too special. The final battle at the end is OK, but it left something to be desired.Also the supporting cast was nothing special. TOny Stark was awesome but the rest of the cast was OK. I can see why a lot of the cast is going to be changed for the next film. Sorry Terrance Howard.So this film is a lot better than the Fantastic Four films, X men films, and the Hulk FIlms. ALso I think it is better than SPiderman 2 and 3. It has a great leading actor, great effects, and a strong story and conflict. I recommend it.","

"Iron Man","Jacques98","8 December 2008","It seems like an obsession with Hollywood to take something intentionally childish and make it ""mature"". You know what I'm talking about. The new Bond movies, the new Batman movies, Transformers, etc., etc. What Hollywood fails to realize is that only one out of every ten movies that follows this style actually ends up being a worthwhile movie.Iron Man is simply one of the nine failures.Outside of the first forty-five minutes, the entire plot line is corny and a wholesale cliché. Elaborating, Iron Man tries to be mature by mixing in the war in the middle-east. It works. That is, it works until the plot turns into the exact same plot as every other sub-par superhero movie out there. It becomes obvious by the first thirty minutes that no good person can die, and all the bad people all cackle oh-so-evilly and have no more intelligence than an average paperweight. By this point you forget the maturity of the movie's opening, and all there is to do is laugh at the impossibly cliché story. It's like watching one of the old cartoons where the good guys always win and the bad guys always have evil-looking beard stubble and talk intelligently only to be slight-handed by the more intelligent good guy. This is the ""mature"" superhero movie everyone told me about? But there is a good chance you didn't watch Iron Man for the plot. You watched it for the action. The only problem with that is there is only two action scenesyes, I counted. One in the opening and one in the ending, with a few spurts of action between that last a whole thirty seconds of screen time. The first one is well-done and actually made me think this could be a decent movie. The last, however, is possibly one of the most unintentionally hilarious climactic scenes of all time. Even if I ignore the fact it's almost copy/pasted in entirety from a Mystery Science 3000 episode, some of the worst CGI used since I Am Legend ruins anything cool about it.The space between the two action scenes is filled with some of the most cliché plotting I've seen in years, as I stated above. Put simply, there is nothing entertaining here. While Robert Downey Jr. plays his role perfectly as usual and puts on a pretty nice comedic bit every few scenes, he can't let me forget the sinking feeling in my gut that this is one of the most boring superhero movies ever made.What more is there for me to say? My pretentious critic conclusion: Iron Man is a severely clichéd, technically poor film with little entertainment value.Half-drunk, adverage joe conclusion: Iron Man is boring and lame. No way is this better than The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2! Both are correct. Iron Man has made me personally give up all hope on the superhero genre.0/10","

Then he is walking around a desert when - of all the luck - a series of helicopters just happen to find him.

They give life to the characters and are all amazing actors. The action sequences were done really well also. This movie has humor, drama, action, romance, intensity, and is told well. The only real issue with the plot itself is that there are a few major plot holes towards the end. For example, how is Obadiah able to see what Pepper downloaded from the computer, check on the progress of his own suit, and then get to Tony's house before Pepper even has a chance to call Tony? Another thing, how does Obadiah get into Tony's house so easily in the first place? Wouldn't you think a genius billionaire like Tony Stark has a halfway decent security system or that Jarvis would've notified Tony? Lastly, how is Obadiah able to master the nuances of his suit immediately without having any trial phase? It took Tony quit a while to master his suit's various functions and yet Obadiah was able to do this right away. These things take away from the movie and prevent it from being a perfect 10/10 but the film was still great. If you're willing to overlook a few flaws then you'll enjoy this a lot.","

"Iron Man","departed07","13 October 2008","Marvel comics has unleashed superhero movies from The Spider-Man Trilogy, The X-Men Trilogy, The Hulk films, The Fantastic Four films, The Punisher, Blade, and Ghost Rider, where now the metallic superhero Iron Man makes his screen debut.To be honest, I didn't know too much about Anthony Stark and his alter ego Iron Man since I was into Spider-Man, the X-Men and Hulk. But once I slipped on the DVD, I got more than I bargain for.Robert Downey Jr. portrays smart technician billionaire and media lover Tony Stark who's gone off to Iraq in showing the army the latest weapons he created until being captured by the enemy. While being a prisoner, he must make the weapons or else he'll be killed off; his heart has been transplanted by a ball device where if it's taken off his chest, he'll die instantly. As a prisoner, Tony gets help from another prisoner by creating a metallic suit to shield himself as he escapes from the underground caves and later thinks about how with his inventions he can get rid of evil after learning that his weapons were not only used by the U.S. army but by the Iraq soldiers as well.It's fun to watch Downey Jr.'s character as Stark trying to reinvent the machine and at the same time learning from his mistakes that nobody's perfect. His performance is a balanced of comedy and serious technique like watching Bill Murray in Ghostbusters. Tony Stark/Iron Man is a good comeback for Robert Downey Jr. who's really had a bit of ups and downs in the past years of his career, but he finally found the right character at last.Jon Favreau (Swingers) directs the film balancing a sense of reality along with mixing humor, action, a bit of romance, adventure, screw-ups, and thrills along the way. Other than Downey Jr. in the film, Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Stark's assistant Pepper Potts who isn't a damsel in distress compared to most leading ladies but a tough cookie who knows everything about her employer and speaks the truth. Terrance Howard plays Stark's friend Col. James Rhodes who'll back him up in anyway while making sure that the billionaire doesn't do anything to screw up. And there's Jeff Bridges who plays Obidiah Stane, Stark's business partner with a few secrets of his own.To conclude, Iron Man rocks in every way! Just be sure to stick around after the credits to see Samuel L. Jackson's cameo performance as Nick Fury.","

"Iron Man","robsta23","17 April 2015","Most superhero movies turn into franchises, unless you're talking about the two different Hulk movies, and the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story. Iron Man is an exception - it is wildly entertaining.I think Robert Downey Jr. nails his role as Tony Stark. So he can get an Oscar nomination for Tropic Thunder but not for this? Johnny Depp can be nominated for Pirates but RDJ can't be nominated for Iron Man? Robert Downey Jr successfully brings Tony Stark to life in this live-action film, showing a big ego along with insecurities such as his on and off feelings for Pepper and his realization that he must sometimes depend on the help of others.There are plenty of humorous parts in the film as well, a lot of them revolving around Tony, but who can't laugh at such a great portrayal of a jackass? The funniest part for me had to be when a scientist apologizes for not being Tony Stark.Towards the conclusion of the movie some aspects do not add up, especially involving Obediah. He has Tony's suit recreated and just happens to know how to run it properly on his first go? Tony is directly over the blast Pepper starts in order to finish off Obediah, and is hardly affected? The third act is everything when it comes to an action film, and it is sad to see some movies take shortcuts to develop a good third act instead of a great one. However, the third act is redeemed so to speak with the iconic ending of Tony Stark admitting he is Iron Man.Fun first installment with an okay third act.","

"Iron Man","thesouthfamily2-552-707097","31 March 2014","The world needs more comic book movies like these; but if we must have one more, ""Iron Man"" is a blueprint for said films. Not only is it a good comic book movie (smart and stupid, stirring and silly, intimate and spectacular), it's winning enough to engage even those who've never cared much for comic books or the movies they spawn.Tony Stark (played brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr.) not only makes the character memorable, but also makes it special. Downey's performance is intriguing, and unexpected. He doesn't behave like most superheroes: he lacks the psychic weight and gravitas. Tony Stark is created from the persona Downey has fashioned through many movies: irreverent, quirky, self-deprecating, wise- cracking. So comfortable is Downey with Tony Stark's dialogue, so familiar does it sound coming from him, that the screenplay seems almost to have been dictated by Downey's persona.But a great hero can only be good as it's villain, and Jeff Bridges gives us a great and memorable performance. It would be so easy to make him a stereotypical villain; but instead, the character of Obadiah Stane plays both the voice of reason for Tony and also the cunning villain that does deals under the table. Instead of being the villain that is so obvious to the audience, he adds charm and personality to the character to make him unique and charismatic.But what also makes the movie work is Stark's relationship with everyone in the cast: not just Obadiah Stane, but also Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). She plays his caretaker/butler, but there is this connection to these two. It would've been easier to make them love interests from the beginning, but they play with that cliché. Also, I like his relationship with Rhodes (Terrence Howard). They bicker a lot, but they also help each other out in a playful way. It's very genuine these relationships that Stark has with these characters, and they don't feel forced. They feel like it adds character to who he is outside of being a snarky tech-wise genius.Everything that Jon Favreu has made a fantastic comic book movie that is not only pleasing to comic book readers, but also people who are not fans of comic books. At the end of the day, it's Robert Downey Jr. lifts up, and brings this character to life through character interaction and through legit drama that makes him go through a legitimate story arc. By building on that, Favreau found his movie, and it's a good one.","

"Iron Man","bob the moo","11 September 2008","Growing up, Tony Stark was always good with machines  very good. This pleased his father, who was equally as skilled and had built his internationally successful weapons company up from the ground with the sole aim of arming his country to help them win the wars they face. When his father died when he was still young, the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but, at 21, Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and, it must be said, something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out, but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture  an announcement that dismays Stane and the board, but not as much as his other plans would.Iron Man was more or less the first big film of the summer and, unlike the blockbuster season of 2007 it was a good start because Iron Man pretty much did everything that a Blockbuster should. It is big noisy fun, with good action sequences, comedy and effects and it is yet another superhero movie  which is the only thing about it that gave me cause for concern. The thing is, as good as some of them are, we also have lame ones where the focus is on the effects and nothing else. Iron Man is not the new Batman films but nor is it anywhere near the level of Fantastic Four, if anything it is like what one would want Fantastic Four to be like. I say this meaning that Iron Man has a solid plot (although the ""developmental"" film is generally the ""easiest"" one to get right), fun characters and a good sense of humour thanks to the character of Stark  I mean, I like Batman's tortured psyche as a subject but Stark would be a lot more fun to hang out with.Towards the end, the plot suddenly moves past the developmental plot line and gets to the ""conclusion"". It is noisy and not as exciting as I would have liked but it is good enough to satisfy those who want to see their money up on the screen. For me the rest of the film was stronger as it focused on Stark, who is nailed by a perfectly cast Downey Jr. His acerbic sense of humour and real lifestyle of excess helps the film and he is an enjoyable centre piece who remains a presence even when he is just a CGI effect on screen. Paltrow looks good and fills the undemanding role well despite me personally not liking her that much. Bridges was a solid presence for the most part, even if not that much is made of him, while Howard is a good name to allow the series to continue with stars on board. I didn't think that Favreau would be up to the task since this is really his first big budget action film but, while not anything special, he did a good job and perhaps it helped with the humour to have him on board but we shall see if he returns with Iron Man 2 (which I'm assuming is a given as a project).So OK we have the Batmans and other good films this summer but for simple popcorn enjoyment, Iron Man holds its own. Don't look for a lot of soul searching (Stark's change of heart is more a plot device than a subject for exploration) but if you would solid action, some good laughs and a generally enjoyable product then this will fill that need till the next one comes along.","

"Iron Man","ohashmawi","5 January 2015","After watching this for the third time, I can't believe I had never realized how incredible this movie is. Iron Man is amazing, probably the second or third best superhero movie ever. It has great acting, incredible effects, great directing from Jon Favreau, and of course, freaking Jeff Bridges. The acting in Iron Man is really good, Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in this movie, after this movie, when you think Tony Stark, you'll think Robert Downey Jr., he really is Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as his assistant, Pepper, Terrence Howard does a very good job as Rhodey, I prefer Don Cheadle, but that's just a matter of opinion, they're both really good as Tony's best friend. And of course, the amazing Jeff Bridges is in this movie. That guy is really an incredible actor, he is great as Obadiah Stane, the only problem I had was that he's the bad guy of the movie, Jeff made a great villain, but I like him way better as a good guy. This guy is great, even as a power-hungry maniac, he's really awesome, obviously, because he's Jeff Bridges.The writing in the movie is very good, the characters were well written, the jokes are great, the movie's funny, witty, and action- packed. I really liked how they chose to play this origin story, I mean, half of the movie he's in captivity, the first time he flies is about 1 hour in the film, and that really worked.The special effects of the movie are really amazing, seriously, him suiting up in the Mark III for the first time was incredible, it gave me goosebumps. Everything is so cool here, the technology in the universe is awesome, but what I think is the coolest thing, is that it's actually believable. That's what makes this movie better than the others, in my opinion. Iron Man 2 and 3 have really ridiculous technology, it's very cool and all, but it makes no sense, Iron Man 2 has those unbelievable holograms, and Iron Man 3 has suits that assimilate on the user, and the Mark 42, which is attracted by microchips in Tony's body. So yeah, the technology of the movie is great because it doesn't seem far away from where we are right now. Also, it has a lot more Iron Man action than the others, and some of the coolest ones, I mean the Middle East parts where freaking amazing, when he said ""My turn"" and blasted the terrorists with his flamethrowers, that gave me goosebumps. The directing by Jon Favreau is great, he really made some exhilarating action, once again, the Middle East scenes were first-rate. But the final fight, wow, that was amazing too, Obadiah hitting Tony with a motorcycle, that was awesome. Also, the soundtrack is perfect, it goes incredibly well with the movie, ACDC with Iron Man, perfect combo.Iron Man is a great movie, in my opinion, it's what comic book movies should be, they need awesome action, good characters and acting and humor. The Dark Knight is great, and it doesn't have that last item, but in my opinion it's a great movie, not just a comic book movie, if you know what I mean, I don't think you did, but whatever. Watch this movie, it's awesome. I give it a 10/10.","

"Iron Man","Morejambo54","14 March 2021","This is still one of the best mcu films to date. Being the first movie in the mcu aloud the writers to take more risks with the plot unlike more recent movies that have followed the same formula. The beginning of the story hooks you in instantly and grabs your curiosity, then it leaps back and tells the beginnings of the invincible iron man. The time tony stark spends as a hostage is very necessary and works very well to change his perspective on many problems.Tony as a character is very strong and excellently played by Robert DJ. From watching the first iron man again it reminded me how much the character has developed throughout the mcu, he starts in this movie as a complete idiot who can be seen as the villain in some sense. The side characters are decent, they don't add a whole lot to the movie but do become increasingly more important. The villain is excellently played and is very intimidating, he isn't that well written into the story, but just enough that the twist shocks the watcher.The action is obviously great, and for a movie made in 2008 the cgi looks incredible minus a few shots...but it could stand out against movies made today. The humour is also pretty good, sometimes a bit misplaced but it does the job nicely. Overall a very fun movie that has influenced the creation of dozens of films to come.","

"Iron Man","mat-mcnaughton-254-33257","20 August 2012","There's something I like to call 'the Sherlock effect'. It basically says that Sherlock Holmes is a genius is is not allowed to be wrong ever. It's how they explain some (or most) of the things he does. It's quite a lazy way to go about the plot, but Robert Downey Jr. is such a phenomenal actor that I let it slide. And the same thing can be said about Tony Stark being everything all at once to everybody. No human could ever handle all that, but Tony Stark is more than human, and combine that with RDJr. to get the perfect person. Not perfect in that he has no flaws, but perfect in that you see past them and accept him for who he is, no matter what crazy things he does.All this talking can be summarized by me saying that RDJr. is brilliant and amazing in whatever he does and that this movie is completely worth it. I hope that many more are made.","

"Iron Man","Tweekums","4 May 2011","At first glance Tony Stark isn't the sort of person you'd expect to become a superhero; he is a genius who has made his fortune inventing and selling state of the art weapons systems. At least he was until he is captured by insurgents in Afghanistan and learns that it isn't only the good guys who use his products. Once they have him the insurgents instruct him to make them a version of his latest weapon; instead he makes an armoured suit that renders him bullet proof and even enables him to fly. Using the suit he manages to escape and when he gets back to the United States he renounces the arms trade much to the consternation of this erstwhile partner. Tony now devotes his time to making a new improved version of the suit which he uses to protect the people that where being oppressed by his company's weapons. He isn't the only person with an armoured suit though; his partner Obadiah Stane is building one too and when it is completed he will attempt to destroy Tony.I found the earlier parts of this film to be the best; Robert Downey Jr. did a good job as Tony Stark making his damascene conversion from arms dealer to protector of the innocent believable at the end the story was just about two giant robots I mean men in power suits fighting; although I'm sure that is the scene younger members of the audience will enjoy most. Jeff Bridges also put in a good performance as bad guy Obadiah and Gwyneth Paltrow was fine as Tony's PA Pepper Potts. I was rather pleased that they managed to avoid the cliché of Tony and Pepper becoming a couple even if it was hinted that they might become one in the future. Unlike a lot of super heroes Tony Stark has no problem with killing his enemies and the weapons he uses may mean some parents might not thing this film is suitable for younger children.","

"Iron Man","blackburnj-1","16 November 2008","Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" fundamentally changed the superhero genre and became a gold standard. What it delivered was an often dark character piece with action to match and it was a blockbuster that art-house filmgoers could enjoy. When he came to direct ""Iron Man"", Jon Favreau had Nolan on his mind and has cited that film as a key inspiration. Favreau has not matched Nolan's achievement, but he has delivered a terrific piece of entertainment, which is not without depth and is superbly cast and well made.The central character of Tony Stark has to work if this film is to be at all successful, and he does, thanks to a snappy script and an absolutely excellent performance from Robert Downey Jr. Stark is similar to James Bond in one respect. You're happy to admire him as smooth and suave on screen, but know that, if he were an actual acquaintance of yours, you would probably loathe him. Despite his gambling, womanising, smug playboy nature, Stark is likable because Downey Jr. makes him unbelievably charming, funny and engaging. Added to this, Stark's character has an arc. Its progression doesn't span the whole film, and it isn't particularly original, but it does provide a point of connection with the character which makes Stark, and indeed Iron Man, a success.The pitch-perfect casting doesn't end there. Gwyneth Paltrow is far less annoying than she could have been and does make the ludicrously named Pepper Potts sympathetic. Terence Howard does a decent job with little to work with (his role is a place-holder for the inevitable sequel). However, the real star of the supporting cast is the ever-excellent Jeff Bridges, whose former-mentor Obadiah Stane is a treat to watch whenever his inversely-haired visage is on screen.The action is done very well. ILM's special effects are flawless and Favreau has a grip on the sequences which are thrilling and entertaining. The final sequence misses the mark a little but still has its moments. The rest of the film is humorous, entertaining and not a minute too long, which suggests that more time could have been spent on character.All-in-all, this film is a decent and entertaining set-up for what could be an interesting franchise. With this cast and the apparently safe hands behind the camera, we should be in for more superb entertainment in the inevitable sequel.4 Stars out of 5","

"Iron Man","GirishGowda","8 May 2010","Iron Man was coming on TV today and since me and my friends are going to 'Iron Man 2' sometime next week, I watched it to recall the characters and see if I still liked it like 2 years back. I am very happy to say that the second time I loved it even more. John Favreau directed this amazing movie which is one of the best superhero movies ever. I am keeping my fingers crossed, that Iron Man 2 will be a truly worthy successor to this amazing gem. Also, if anybody has a lifestory to tell, Downey Jr. has the ultimate comeback tale to tell. After all those stints in rehab and prison, he came back revamped in a new avatar and 2008 and 2009 were his years. He has become on of my favorite actors now.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is rich, handsome, intelligent, quick witted, incredibly wealthy and a playboy. He is the owner of Stark Industries which specializes in making warheads for the US military. He is kidnapped by an Afghanistan terrorist group who forces him to help them make his new, modern missiles. But Tony Stark, along with another Afghan scientist who is kidnapped, builds a suit of iron and escapes from their stronghold. Unfortunately the scientist is killed and he returns to his home. He has now seen that his weapons are in the hands of the bad guys and wants to stop the production of the warheads. But Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) advices him against this, because the consequences will be too great. Stane was his father's best friend and a business partner and he is now a major player in the Stark Industries and a close confidante of Tony Stark. Will Tony Stark make a difference in the world with his Iron Man? This is kind of a breath of fresh air to the superhero genre. It doesn't have all the baggages of other superheroes. Tony Stark is a man who enjoys life and he is a ladies man. I thought, what were they thinking by casting a middle aged man like Downey Jr, but that was before I saw the movie. After watching and being enthralled by the story, I accept that Downey was really born to play the role of Iron Man. The underplayed romance between Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Tony Stark works well for the story. Tony Stark changed his views about weapons after seeing what it did to other people who were in the line of fire. He wasn't a born justice upholder like other superheroes and he is a man behind all that metallic gear. This is what makes Iron Man so much more endearing. If the character of Obadiah Stane was played by any other actor other than Jeff Bridges, it would have been simply awful. I didn't even know who Jeff was before this year's Oscar, but I still remember hating his evil persona character back when it released. Terrence Howard plays Stark's best friend Rhodey, who is an officer in the US military and his character is under written. But, I thought he would get a chance to display his acting in the second movie, but they have put some other man in his part and it is so sad that he won't be a part of Iron Man 2. The banter of Stark with his robotic assistants, the freezing of the Iron Man suit and everything except the final battle is brilliant. The final battle is supposed to be like that, so I can't hate Favreau for that.The background score is awesome and the cgi effects seemed insanely real. Iron Man 2 released here yesterday (so sad its releasing late here) and I hope it will be awesome :) 9/10","

"Iron Man","utku_kamil_ozen","23 February 2017","Before i start my review, i'd like to note that it's impossible to criticize this film without putting the ''comic book googles'' on. Because it's such a mess in terms of reality, even for a sci-fi film. I mean, even if you could come up with an indestructible material for your armor, it won't save you anyway when you hit the ground at 200 mph, g force will kill you no matter what kind of armor you wear. And the character wasn't established as a super human, he's flesh and bone. So, the technical premise of the film is very weak and b movie level, made me laugh so many times. But as i said, i'll put the comic book googles on and ignore the ridiculously nonsensical technical side of the film. Because the film is not about that.The first thing that has bothered me, aside from the above-mentioned issue, was the starting point of the character arc. We were supposed to dislike Tony Stark a little bit at the start. Because he comes off as an arrogant, war profiteering, misogynistic, cynical hedonist at the start. But the film failed to reflect him as such. And instead Tony Stark was portrayed as a very likable, rockstar-like character - despite all his negative qualities shown- from the very beginning of the film. In fact, i believe most common audiences(especially American, no offence) didn't see anything wrong with Stark's character by the way it was delivered. But maybe the director was trying to be subtle in the way he delivered his negative sides. Nevertheless, i think it failed there. For me, the most enjoyable part of the film came after this failed character introduction; the escape from the death cave. I could have enjoyed a film solely based on this escape alone. I loved the idea of him making the robot-armor under such difficult conditions, out of different equipment, while being monitored by the terrorists, and i loved that crude armor mark 1. Following that, came the most disappointing part, where he rocketed into the sky with the crude, bulky armor. This was the turning point of the technical side(which i was enjoying up until that point) of the film. Generally, humor was done very well and Robert Downey Jr. did a great job with the character. And this is the main reason why these Iron Man and Avengers films are so successful. Another positive thing was the love interest part. I liked how they had a history together and how they took it slow, it felt real. Because in such films, most often, the character meets the love interest during the story of the film and then they fall in ''love'' even though they know nothing about each other and they are ready to die for one another(stupid thor). So it didn't do that. The villain was too comic booky(wink wink), and i wish they had done more with Jeff Bridges, he's such an interesting actor.In conclusion, i had fun watching this, despite all the negative things that bothered me. Robert Downey Jr. carried this very well and made it a memorable, fun film.","

"Iron Man","alexkolokotronis","28 January 2009","Iron Man was not the revolutionary movie comic book movie people were claiming it to be. In fact it was a rather disappointing film. I thought it was corny and even more backwards for the state of comic book movies than anything else.The acting was good when it came to Robert Downey Jr. He was the only reason I had any respect for this film at all. It lifted the movie up from garbage to mediocrity. Terrence Howard who I am not fan of was very annoying to me and Jeff Bridges was about as under utilized with his abilities as he has ever been.The directing was below average in that the action seems were un-satisfying and the film failed to engross me whatsoever. I tried very hard to get involved in the movie but the movie just felt like it was dragging on and it only got worse. The conclusion was bad and the supposed great writing was non-existent in my mind. The effects were very good but I was not put into awe by them.I obviously did not enjoy this film but if you are a die hard comic book fan you probably will enjoy this. If you are a movie fan though and are looking for something different in a comic book movie watch The Dark Knight not Iron Man.","

"Iron Man","Jay_Exiomo","29 April 2008","The summer blockbuster season has indeed come and ""Iron Man"" is a fine film that provides a solid diversion through the course of its running time - at least for the first hour. But it's always good to see Robert Downey Jr. and it goes without saying that, despite equally impressive performances from the supporting cast, he owns this movie.Based from yet another Marvel comic book superhero, Downey is Tony Stark, a genius billionaire industrialist who has amassed his great fortune by developing weapons for the US military. On a trip to Afghanistan he is captured by terrorists, is held hostage and forced to build a weapon for his captors. He instead secretly builds a power armor that would help him escape and keep him alive from a shrapnel that has been embedded in his heart.He escapes and upon his return to America, he develops a more advanced suit, giving him superhuman strength, capable of flying and firing missiles among others, whereupon he is dubbed as the Iron Man.While the movie begins interestingly with glimpses of Stark's confused character, it stalls during the second part where the uncreative riffs of an origin movie seems like obligatory parts director Jon Favreau and the screenwriters are too eager to be done with. Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's PA Pepper Potts is charming, but Paltrow doesn't exactly have chemistry with Stark. Terrence Howard as Stark's best bud Jim Rhodes is slightly underused and one wishes there would be more of him in case a few more sequels are underway.As for the obligatory villain, a bald and bearded Jeff Bridges effectively plays an otherwise drab villain on Stark's teacher and business partner Obadiah Stane. There's no depth in his character and he's about as cartoonish as a villain can get, so to speak. The climactic battle between him and Iron Man isn't that exciting either.Retconned to modern times, it's not just about some teenager with personal vendetta to deal with; it's about a man riddled with guilt and a global issue to deal with. It's just disappointing that Favreau would bypass Stark's conflicts for the obvious and less trappings of a summer blockbuster.Still for the most part, the movie's entertaining. There's some great CGI, some humor all around - mostly from Downey - and a couple of action sequences that are better handled than the climactic one. Plus it's pretty easy to cheer for the hero even if for most of the time he's battling enemies who have no chance of winning.So while ""Iron Man"" isn't a lock on achieving an A-list status in terms of superhero movies, it gets its job done and leaves one hoping it earns enough at the box office so we'll get to see more of Downey as the eponymous superhero, and crossing our fingers it will be better now the conventional part's done with.","

He's not carrying what happens until something comes about that changes his mind and makes him make a super suite to combat world terror. Thus Iron Man was born.This is yet another great action film with predictable plot and a big fight at the end. Comic book fans will like this movie as it is fairly accurate to the story of Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent with the part of Tony Stark I doubt it could have been played better. The only downer of this movie is the fact that it's still just another blockbuster with predictable plot but I'm fine for more of the same but it won't get above an 8 no matter how cool it looks or is acted out.","

"Iron Man","kieranbattams","24 April 2015","Anyone remember the days when Marvel studios wasn't a mammoth technical market and didn't feature Norse gods and talking raccoons? I figured that because i am finally going to see my most anticipated film ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" tonight i would revisit the very start of the Marvel cinematic Universe and get to know Tony Stark all over again. This film really stood out to me back in 2008 as one of the best films i'd seen, not just in the superhero genre but in general. To this day the film still stands out to me as the best standalone film and the perfect way to start the universe we have all grown to love. Iron Man was very much more grounded in reality, i mean sure none of the things that Stark creates and uses can be replicated, but at the time going from this to Thor seemed like it wasn't possible. Oh, how times change.The plot follows Tony Stark, who as you all know by now is played with absolute perfection and flawlessness (is that a word) by the very talented Robert Downey Jr. He is given an electromagnet to prevent shrapnel from entering his heart and killing him from what was an explosion by his own company's weapon. Instead of building a missile that terrorists demand from him Tony builds an arc reactor and a suit of armour that he uses to get his own back. This causes Stark to order all weapons stop being made and he develops a high-tech suit to use and becomes the hero we all love, Iron Man. Jeff Bridges is also very good and uses an accent that isn't Texan cowboy with throat cancer as Obadiah Stane (Iron Monger) who has his own plans for Stark Industries and the final showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger gives us what is one of the most spectacular from phase one. Marvel has never had a strong point for villains, Ronan from Guardians of the Galaxy is a prime example. But when they get a villain right they get it very right! (Think Loki) and Obadiah Stane in this movie is one of the best the MCU has to offer.Watching Gwyneth Paltrow in this movie felt weird too. She was very much just Tony's assistant and acted a lot differently to the way she does in say, Iron Man 3. This is some really good development for her character and she of course does a great job as Pepper Potts. We also have Terrence Howard as James Rhodes which looking at it now felt out of place since we have all gotten used to Don Cheadele. This isn't to say he did a bad job, in fact he did a very good job but it would be nice to know why he didn't appear in any subsequent films after this. A particular scene featured Rhodes looking at Tony's Mark II suit (War Machine prototype) and saying ""next time, baby"". Sorry Terrence, not next time.In the end Iron Man is absolutely the best way to kick off a universe of characters and he will always be the Avenger that sticks with me as a result of this movie. Downey Jr. Made the character his very own and i cannot imagine another actor taking his place. Robert is Iron Man and is the best casting since Hugh Jackman as WolverineI give Iron Man a perfect rating as it is a film that i have grown to love more since i first saw it and it will be a part of my collection until the very end. Definitely check it out if you haven't already. Plus we got our first scenes with Coulson and our first post-credits scene which is still the best one today. All this and more, it not only stands as one of my favourite superhero movies but one of the best of all time. I will be reviewing Tony Stark's latest adventure with Avengers Age of Ultron tonight so stay tuned for that! And yes.. i am so excited that if i wait any longer i will self destruct.","

But I know that this movie was a lot of fun and it seems to owe many things to Batman Begins ... beginning with an ensemble cast!But the main actor here is of course Robert Downey Jr. If you have followed his career & private life (some ups, unfortunately many ""downs"" too, no pun intended), you have to be real happy seeing him getting recognized for his talent and finally beginning to explore his (acting) abilities and being confident enough to play major roles. This is apparent through the screen/his acting. He is very comfortable (not only because of the ""support"" cast, that ... supports him, Terence Howard, Gwyneth P. and Jeff B.) and this helps elevate the movie! It is fun & light, but with an honest message/warning (just like Mr. Downey himself)","

"Iron Man","liberalgems","6 May 2008","I have to admit, I fell for all the hype that this was going to be a enjoyable film. The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure! One of the problems with Iron Man is that it's geared towards the mind of a child/young teen without any charm. It's so incredibly predictable, a sort of comic-book-story-formula-film. A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story. - I'm tired of the meanie terrorist villains. I'm tired of the totally clueless good guy(s). I'm tired of the evil mentor! This story has absolutely zero imagination. It's at the intelligence level of a second-rate, Saturday morning cartoon! It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable! The really bad guys have alway got to be Arabs, or look like Arabs. They kill innocent civilians for no reason. They hide in caves, like the hated Japanese soldiers did in World War 2. But only a rich and powerful U.S. weapons inventor & dealer can come to the rescue! Wow! What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world! Who would ever of guessed that deep, down, inside, some of the Merchants of Death literally have a heart of gold (or palladium, in this case)! Afghanistan is currently an extremely troubled country even though it has a very rich cultural tradition. It's a shame it was dumbed down in Iron Man to helpless civilians, brutal warlords, an impotent and clueless U.S. military and one white man who had a very unconvincing conversion experience. If Hollywood is going to bring politics and current events into a comic book story then they need act more like mature adults, instead of soulless moneygrubers trying to make a quick buck off of the horrific suffering of people in some distant land. Afghanistan is not some make believe place! It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday! I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots. And, while I'm at it, it would be nice if some of the many millions of dollars Hollywood is going to make from Iron Man is donated to various third-party, non-profit organizations working on reconstructing Afghanistan's civilian infrastructure! They certainly could use the money!","

"Iron Man","alansmithee04","14 November 2008","Featuring the very latest in computer generated effects and a plot that would insult a retarded six year old, Ironman is the latest in a long line of Hollywood product culled from the dizzying literary heights of superhero comic books.Product this disposable doesn't happen by accident. Teams of industry product makers work around the clock for years to make something this tasteless, tedious and utterly bland. Don't even try to characterize this product as a ""movie."" It simply isn't.If Ironman was edible, it would be a jar of baby food. Library paste flavored baby food. If it were music, it would be chopsticks. If it were a vehicle, it would be a tricycle. A tricycle with training wheels. If it were...What? Oh yeah, the product. It's something about the usual gazillionaire playboy who flies around in a sooper-dooper extra-gadgety metal suit and frees Afghanistan from the Evil Brown People, making the country safe for, I dunno, oil companies I guess. The plot is such a pile of moronic sub-juvenile drivel it's impossible to focus on for more than a few minutes before being distracted by something more interesting like, say, the butter-flavored grease stains on the bottom of your popcorn bag.Contempt for it's audience drips from every frame of this product. No doubt the droolcase fanboy target audience will be thrilled to down to their Batman Under-Roos by Downey's lackluster performance as he sleepwalks through the product's repulsive hero role. The product is certainly simple enough for people who regard Cheetos as food group and think repetitively boring video games are the apex of computer technology.But aside from it's pimply focus group, the only other audiences to which this product could possibly appeal would be coma patients and Scientologists. And you'd probably have to tie down the coma patients.","

"Iron Man","davidmvining","25 November 2019","I know what Tony Stark's character arc is supposed to be in this movie. I do not know what it actually is, though.Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer who works on contracts from the United States government. He starts the movie finishing a large sale for a new missile called the Jericho. It produces its large explosions, the military is happy, and Tony makes his sale. His convoy is quickly beset by terrorist forces, Stark is captured, and the terrorists force him to produce a Jericho missile for them in a cave with some leftover Stark weapons they have sitting around. The idea that they have the right materials for a new weapon system from older weapons is a bit ridiculous, but it's probably not quite as ridiculous as the idea that these same weapons have the parts to create a state of the art, miniature, perpetual source of energy that fits into a slot in Tony's chest. But hey, it's a techno-fantasy. Let's just roll with it.Tony produces a suit of armor instead because his captors are idiots who can't tell the difference between a chest plate and a missile casing. With the help of a kindly local doctor who speaks every language the plot requires of him, Tony escapes. It helps that the doctor has the perfect mix of wanting to live long enough to help Tony and wanting to die to join his family in death so he throws his life away to help Tony escape.Tony returns home where he immediately holds a press conference and declares that Stark Industries will never produce weapons again. Everyone freaks out, but then everyone forgets about it about twenty minutes later when Tony just never shows up to work in order to ensure that his radical orders get carried out. Instead, he stays in his mansion over a cliff looking out at the ocean and plays with his toys. That is, he upgrades his cave suit for the 21st century and gives himself a new miraculous source of eternal energy for his chest (ordering the old one, which could conceivably power a house for some time, to be thrown out).Okay, so let's take a step back and try to figure out what Tony's arc is. He starts the movie as a playboy arms dealer. He gets captured and realizes that his weapons are being sold to terrorists. He gets home and starts the process (without ever following up) to end all weapons manufacture in his company. He then proceeds to build his own weapon in the form of a high-tech suit which he then uses to kill a bunch of people, protecting some family we've never met before. So, what's the arc? He almost grows and then doesn't? He starts as a playboy and ends as a...murderous playboy? Yeah, he protects people, so I guess that's it, using his tools for good instead of just not paying attention to who uses them. It's confused and thin.Oh, and let's get to the antagonist of the film, Obadiah Stane. Stane makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are really two parts to his villainy, so let's take it one at a time. The first part occurs before the action of the movie. He arranges for Tony to be kidnapped and murdered by the terrorists before Tony ever leaves. Why? The closest we get is that Tony doesn't take the business side of things seriously. He doesn't show up to an awards ceremony. I mean, I guess that's good enough reason to murder the CEO and lifelong friend. The second part of the characters villainy occurs after Tony returns from the caves. Obviously, Stane isn't going to like the idea of Stark shutting down a major division of the company, but he actually ends up ensuring that the steps Tony wants to happen never happen. There's a shock to the system (highlighted by talk of the company's stock price dropping), but once Tony's in his little lab working (for supposedly weeks), things seem to be going on as normal at Stark Industries. So, of course Stane recreates Tony's original suit in a larger form and goes on a kill crazy rampage which only Tony can stop.Stane has bugged me since I first saw this movie in 2008, and I just can't shake the fact that there must be at least ten minutes of deleted scenes explaining a lot of this. But whether they're on a home video release as extras or not, all that matters is what's in the movie itself, and the movie chose to make Stane completely nonsensical (probably for ""pacing"" reasons).Alright, I've ragged on this movie enough. I'm far from hating it. The action is good. Robert Downey Jr. is fun as Stark and carries most of the movie despite my problems with Tony's arc. It looks good in a clean and straightforward sort of way. The music is functionally complimentary to the action on screen. If you ignore the fact that none of the characters do anything that makes a lick of sense, it's actually fairly entertaining when it's not being overly serious. I remember liking this movie a whole lot more in 2008 than now, though I never loved it like many people do. Eleven years later, rewatching it for the first time in about a decade, I have to say that I was actually really disappointed in it overall.","

"Iron Man","movieman_kev","9 May 2008","The latest superhero based film that comes down the pipeline is Iron Man,telling the origin of how billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) becomes Iron Man while captured by the enemy during wartime (updating the story, substituting the Koreans for the Taliban for obvious reasons) Casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was a stroke of genius given his highly public past escapades, and after seeing him as the hard-drinking, womanizing, wealthy industrialist turned superhero Iron Man by sheer necessity one would be hard pressed to view an other actor portraying him. Downey IS Stark and this is a primary reason why the movie works so well (there's a scene late in the movie where he has a scene that mirrors ""Less Then Zero"", in look more than subject matter, that I quite enjoyed, but won't spoil here). Jeff Bridges holds his own very well as Obadiah Stane, Tony's main foil, but there's no stealing the spotlight from Robert in the least. This is fully his film.However even with the immaculate casting, the film only would be as good as it's storyline, fortunately here too it excels, remaining highly compelling and vastly entertaining (for the most part, of course a scene or two could've been trimmed a tad to tighten things up, it still works though). The direction by Jon Favreau is great as well and remarkably solid (even if the same can't of his role as Happy Hogan) All in all, this is the first great blockbuster of 2008 and will likely remain the best until the new Indiana Jones comes out. It already, without a doubt, ranks up with the best Super-hero movies made thus far.PS. Make sure to stay until after the credits for a nifty surpriseMy Grade: A-","

"Iron Man","Strider_1978","22 May 2008","I might be the wrong audience for this film and I don't want to pull it down without fairly good reasoning.I can suspend disbelief to a degree.

"Iron Man","andrewnmiller","9 February 2015","Having never read the Iron Man comics as a kid and having never seen this film when it first came out in '08, I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch it. Would it be dark and complex, overly campy or a fun action romp? Well, I can say Iron Man totally blew me away from its action and visual effects to its acting and writing. After watching this, it's hard to imagine what the MCU would have been without this movie.We start off in the deserts of Afghanistan where a military convoy is escorting millionaire playboy Tony Stark to show off his new ""Jericho"" missile. The convoy is then attacked and Tony is significantly wounded by one of his own weapons. Tony is then captured and imprisoned by a terrorist organization called the Ten Rings. Stark discovers that an electromagnet has been embedded into his chest to prevent shrapnel from reaching his heart and killing him. The Ten Rings Leader Raza then offers Tony his freedom in return for Tony building a Jericho missile for the group, but Stark has no intention of keeping his word. With the help of fellow inmate, Yinsen, Tony builds an arc reactor to charge the electromagnet and a suit of armor. Following his escape from the cave and returning home, Stark shows up at a press meeting and announces that his company will no longer make weapons after what he witnessed earlier in the film. He also builds an enhanced version of the suit plus a new arc reactor. Now, Tony must fight his inner demons as well as putting his talents to making the world better.While superhero films have become an everyday factor in the summer blockbuster season, one question always comes up: how does one make a comic book film stand out in the middle of so much superhero completion while remaining faithful to the comics? It seems John Favreau has that covered. Right from the opening chords of ""Back in Black"" it becomes obvious that Iron Man is a different kind of superhero movie. Rather than go the Christopher Nolan route by making the movie as darker and grittier than its source material ever needed to be, Favreau isn't afraid to welcome a much needed sense of fun without diverting into outright silliness. In the process, Iron Man essays an outstanding balance between welcoming every entertaining element while preserving the seriousness and difficulty of the origin story and the characters. Also by modernizing Tony's backstory from Vietnam to Afghanistan, the movie adds a touch of political tragedy, making a few tongue in cheek remarks about the US military in the process.The script is one of the things that really sell this film, with a string of intelligently written lines, a far cry from some of the more overused Hollywood writing that could've been thought by your ordinary six year old. Robert Altman's influence on the script leads to several humorous ad-libbing on top of the written material.Favreau doesn't hold back when it comes to the action and the visual effects, resulting in some enthralling action set pieces such as a fight in an Afghan village and a final show down between Iron Man and Iron Monger, not to mention some truly edgy scenes as well as the adrenaline pumping scene of Stark testing his Mark 1 armor during his escape. The special effects are flawless and are carried out perfectly without overwhelming the movie's overall story. Iron Man's armor looks stunning, a clinking mass of machinery that come together with a heart beating exterior. The same can also be said for the musical score which delivers some aptly heroic themes.Of course, this movie wouldn't be half the movie it is without its cast and what a cast: Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly believable as Pepper Potts, her charm and cool comebacks easily being an excellent foil to Tony's livewire performance and brings some serious-minded glow of sexual tightness and interaction between her and Tony. Jeff Bridges molds his normal laid-back look into a wickedly conniving businessperson hiding his self-centered dealings under a façade of decency and while it was interesting to see Bridges play a villain, he did a great job, Terrence Howard provides an appropriately brisk aroma of self-respect as Tony's friend, James Rhodes, enhancing his performance with just the perfect amount of deadpan delivery, but the real star here is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. I can't praise his performance enough as he is the key element to making Iron Man stand out amongst other comic book films. Easily the best performance in his career, Downey fluently makes every single inch of Tony his own and puts an unconventional spin on the character through his wisecracking, smart mouthed dynamism while still staying true to Stark's character, even making the shift from an arrogant playboy to a humanitarian wearing an iron suit possible through his personality and his shining, zealous strength. There are some obvious parallels between Tony and RDJ's personal lives when it comes to the excess and women. Downey plays a bit of a double-faced role here as Stark and Iron Man, on one hand being his lavish self whose duty is the maintenance of his father's company vs his own mission to become a better person. The dialog given to Robert in every scene is full of one-liners finished in quick time. To say that RDJ was born to play this role is an understatement; he is and will always be Iron Man. Even Samuel Jackson has a brief appearance as S.H.I.E.L.D agent, Nick Fury who sets the scene for later events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Iron Man is a perfect superhero movie. I really don't have any issues with it, it just rocks all around. So do yourselves a favor and give this film a watch, you'll enjoy it.","

"Iron Man","McGrit","28 April 2008","This first big popcorn movie of the year is also the best summer movie since Spider-Man 2.What I liked is that there's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The playboy, hard-drinking, fast-talking arms merchant goes to Afghanistan to show the military Stark Industries' cool new toy. Events unfold and he sees, first hand, what his ordnance and his creations do to real people.The movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting. Downey brings not only his real life baggage and winning personality to play as Stark; he finds his pathos, too. Jeff Bridges certainly has the acting chops to hang with Downey and is the perfect foil and perfect villain because this is no mustache twirling, one dimensional character. Terrence Howard is perfect as the military man and old college buddy. Gwyneth Paltrow's character adds to the casting perfection. She's every bit the wise yet sexy assistant whose a match for her womanizing boss. The interaction and the relationships all work well and is even one one the highlights of the entire movie itself. Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, Iron Man's creators mix everything so well. It leans away from dark but touches on it just enough. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they had Downey's talents to play with but Downey's performance leads to more clever banter and genuinely real dialogue than most comic-book movies have ever delivered. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Downey's Stark is glib and even obnoxious at times but he never loses his likability and grows in to something more. That's true character establishment and development in a comic book film, people. Even the flirtation between Stark and his assistant has the undertow of lonely romantic longing and implications. What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that every death carries real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix great acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. Oh yeah, did I mention that Iron Man kicks butt and is loads of fun too? That you could tell from the flood of action clips seen leading up to the movie. The CG is perfect and the action is intense and very well done. That's no shocker. What was a pleasant surprise was that Iron Man is a complete movie.(PS- It also includes the funniest Stan Lee cameo he's ever done)","

Updated from its comic book beginnings to our present century of world terror I M villains are the usual suspects of semi-literate hateful Afghans and greedy American capitalists strikingly familiar to the same difficult types encountered by Super,Spider and Bat mans.Tony Stark, brilliant inventor and mega rich arms dealer goes through a moral conversion after being wounded and captured by Afghan terrorists. Managing to build an armor plated flying suit under the eyes of his moronic captors he escapes to fight another day, this time in a really neat looking metallic model. When Tony wants to do a one eighty with the business his evil partner attempts to thwart him. Who shall win this titanic struggle of good and evil? Who cares. We're here to be visually mesmerized and that we are but only for brief periods and with the same twists and turns crashes and explosions that every mega budgeted fiction fantasy flic offers.Robert Downey Jr. as the I Man is a brilliant piece of marketing in art imitating life. The one time drug sodden loser like the comic book character has managed to rise Phoenix like from the ashes of a ruined career and parlay it into what looks to be a mega money maker for the next decade. Downey is the right choice but hardly tested as an actor since a super hero's emotional range is very limited (it's the reason villains are so much more interesting)but he does manage to bring a cool hipness to the square super hero model. Jeff Bridges overacts a tad with an evil Daddy Warbucks impression and Gwyneth Paltrow as suffering girl Friday Pepper Potts seems to be in the downward spiral Downey was with the culprit not being drugs but lack of talent.The special effects are predictably spectacular and there's a heavy metal music score to bludgeon you along the way as the assembly line plot unfolds with less grace than the first Spiderman and even less humor and suspense than Robo-Cop. You seen one you seen 'em all. This is a newer but not improved hybrid model of a crowded field and it is more tin than iron.","

"Iron Man","Benedict_Cumberbatch","8 May 2008","I went to see ""Iron Man"" knowing nothing about the character (never read the comic books) and without great expectations. I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan and if not for his presence, I probably would've ignored it. I didn't like it as much as most people, but it was fairly entertaining (and that's what I was expecting after all, we're not talking about groundbreaking film-making here and I don't think anybody expects that from this, right?) and that's mostly thanks to Downey Jr., one of the coolest actors out there, a chameleon who can play pretty much everything. Adding to the ""cool"" aspect of the movie, Jeff Bridges plays the villain. I'm glad that the long, dark phase of drug abuse Downey Jr. was living some years ago is over, and the man is alive and kicking to continue delighting audiences. Plus, ""Iron Man"" will introduce him to a whole new generation. Don't expect much and enjoy the ride; better a summer flick with Robert Downey Jr. than a dozen Michael Bays starring bland new ""stars"" and tanned Angelina Jolie wannabes. 7/10.","

Movie tries to make things as interesting as possible for the new and unknown audience.Comic geeks like myself would have to conclude that this is the Iron Man we all knew but in the different era and technology.But I'm pretty much amazed how Favreau managed to make the suit alive.","

This is one movie that cuts to the chase in a manner that can entertain comic and non comic fans alike. Moreover, Obadiah Stane finds the fact that Tony gives the world its best weapon ever by trying to rid it of weapons really ironic. Well that isn't all that meets the eye, trying to order a hit to have Tony killed leads to Obadiah building a hero out of him, which is even more ironic and awesome at the same time. Heroes aren't born, they're built. Moreover, what this movie did different was that it skipped the origin story and started with the important part. Director Jon Favreau and actor Robert Downey Jr put in their best to satisfy the audience in this action packed, must watch comic book movie.","

"Iron Man","bkoganbing","19 May 2008","From what I can see of Iron Man, he's different from other superheroes in two respects. First he's quite the vulnerable one and second he's put together with extreme, but very human intelligence. Nobody came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond mortal men. No one got their DNA mixed up with some animal to give them some extra-sapien traits. No Iron Man is put together in a laboratory after a prototype is done while in captivity in a cave.That's probably both the strength and weakness of this film. Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and most of all Jeff Bridges look like they're having a great old time putting flesh and bone on comic strip characters. I'm glad they enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do these kind of films.Iron Man is updated to today's world situation, but with some Thirties flashbacks because it's an arms dealer who is the chief villain here. Downey is like Bruce Wayne, a multimillionaire heir to an armaments fortune who likes to have a good time as well as work while Bridges minds the company day to day. But that MIT education did not go for naught as those Afghan terrorists found out. Downey proves as resourceful as B.A. Baracus of the A-Team in developing the Iron Man first to escape captors and then to defeat bad guys. And these bad guys are quite in league.But while the special effects are nice and the players are having a good time, Iron Man reminded me of a Popeye cartoon. Downey and Bridges looked Popeye and Bluto in the best two out of three falls. All that Downey needed to do was reach for that can of Spinach.I half expected he would.","

Feeling more like another pro military movie like captain america (even though this one was tech first lol) i still like rewatching it with my brothers. I am also one of those people that prefers Terrance Howard as War Machine but thats just cause he is a great actor. This movie is a good mix at feeling like a super hero movie set in modern times, where some of the others just get to fantasy or sci fi heavy to feel relatable. I get lots of laughs in this movie and anytime I see Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man cause he was born for the role.","

"Iron Man","jjgooner","1 July 2013","Iron Man***1/2 (out of 4)120 mins/ 12Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Gwenyth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Paul Bettany, Jon Favreau, Clark Gregg, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir, Leslie Bibb, Bill SmitrovichDirector: Jon FavreauPlot: After weapons dealer, Tony Stark, is forced to build an iron suit to save his life, he decides to use it to fight back against evil powers.JJ's Verdict: Iron Man is probably the coolest film to grace our screens since Oceans Eleven did in 2001. Iron Man introduces us to charming, playboy, billionaire, and tech-genius; Tony Stark. He is irresponsible and forgetful and would rather spend his time flirting with ladies in casino's than working or receiving a world peace award at a up-town dinner event. However, while showcasing his new weapons, he is captured by Arab terrorists and forced to build an iron-plated suit to help him escape his captures. This makes him more responsible and wary of the world, which leads him to becoming 'Iron Man'. Robert Downey Jr. plays his role so cool and carefree that you almost feel his is playing himself. This isn't a bad thing though as this is an inspired piece of casting from Marvel as the script seemed to almost fit RDJ's blueprint. Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Stark's loyal assistant Pepper Potts, not only puts in a great performance, but has brilliant, buzzing chemistry with her Downey Jr. Terrence Howard makes a decent buddy to Stark and Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, although a predictable character, is good as the demanding foster-father to Tony. Also in the cast are relative unknowns Shaun Toub and Clark Gregg who might have just become overnight stars. Toub plays Yinsen, a doctor who aids Stark in his building of the suit, and Gregg, who plays S.H.I.E.L.D agent Phil Coulson.The film itself is actually very good. The film mixes humour with action to great effect. The technology and effects created are marvellous. From the construction of the suit, to the software at Tony's 'bachelor pad' and the dazzling action sequences. The suit itself is well designed and has uses its many functions brilliantly – and thats just the prototype. The music syncs well with the fun action scenes and is in especially good use when Stark flies through t he night sky to the backdrop of L.A. Jon Favreau (also playing Stark's bodyguard) directs this very well considering all his previous directing efforts have been comedies. Although, while trying to be realistic, gets too far-fetched and the film's pacing is poor; Iron Man is one of the best entertainments you'll get in a long time! And also watch out for a brilliant, well worth the watch, post-credits scene with the world's smoothest actor (of course lining it up for a sequel).","

"Iron Man","moutonbear25","4 May 2008","What is Iron Man anyway? Can we really call him a superhero? As far as I can tell, he's just a guy with a bum heart that happens to be pretty handy in the shop. His superhero development falls more in line with Batman's as neither necessarily has any special power (Wait, my bat-sense is tingling?) but rather relies on strength and gadgetry to get the job done. Even Batman has the dark history to fuel his passion though. What does Iron Man have? His day job is as an arms manufacturing tycoon named Tony Stark. He's got all the money in the world, women throwing themselves at him and the worst part is, he inherited everything from his dad. This silver spoon baby has been set his whole life and now he gets to be admired and adored as a superhero too? Ordinarily, I would give in to my jealousy and scoff at this supposed superhero but Robert Downey Jr., under the fresh direction of Jon Favreau, just makes him too damn cool for me to do anything other than love him.Aside from all this, Iron Man is also hilarious. Make no mistake; he most certainly gets himself into a number of perilous scenarios but he also manages to find something to laugh at no matter how dire the circumstances. While the original comic book found Stark in some life threatening Vietnam war situation (I am not a comic book junkie so I'm afraid I can't get more specific than that), Favreau wanted today's Iron Man to have a contemporary back story and what could be more appropriate than Stark being held prisoner in Osama Bin Laden's former hood, the mountains of Afghanistan. At first, it feels all too easy to place Arab militants as the face of the bad guys but the film vindicates its initial racial vilifying by exposing Stark himself (and therefore, America) as the supplier of these terrorists' entire arsenal. It is Stark's realization that he truly is one of the great mass murderers in American history that wakes him from his comfortable, privileged existence to a new dawn of using his position for positive change. After all, a weapon is only truly a weapon when it is in the wrong hands.IRON MAN is not without its clichés. Stark suffers injuries in the Middle East that requires him to have some form of electro-magnetic contraption lodged in his chest so that little bits of shrapnel don't seep into his blood stream and eventually cut up the arteries in his heart. So what if the ultimate playboy/loner now needs help to sustain a healthy heartbeat when he has walked around for so long acting like he never had a heart in the first place. So what if the man who has everything doesn't truly have anything of real value. These kinds of truisms are the foundation of comic book characters; what genuinely matters is how the men are portrayed and Downey Jr. was born to play to Tony Stark. After rising to critical fame with films like CHAPLIN, personal problems with drug abuse led Downey to years of type casting as characters with drug problems in films like WONDER BOYS and THE SCANNER DARKLY. With IRON MAN, it looks like he might finally be able to wipe his past clean and achieve the heights his talent has always warranted. Though his body is in noticeably better shape, it is his quick-witted delivery and cynical yet sympathetic duality that make Tony Stark the kind of guy everyone wants to hang out with or just plain be. So, what is Iron Man anyway? Well, according to this adaptation, he is the superhero for the modern era. He is sarcastic and skeptical but still hopeful and genuine with those he is close with (most notably, his perfectly matched assistant Pepper Potts, played just as delectably by Gwyneth Paltrow). He is a man who is capable of admitting his failures, not dwelling on them and then fostering a new path for himself. He is the kind of man that is both envied and looked up to. He is building himself a reputation as a superhero that can manage tremendous feats through intelligence and perseverance rather than just brawn and dumb luck. And now, IRON MAN is also a movie that offers perspective on the world around us at the same time as some awesome exhilaration.","

"Iron Man","Howlin Wolf","9 May 2008","These morally compromised times all but demand that a morally compromised anti-hero be allowed to stand at their centre, and there are moments when an audience member is left to reflect that the alter-ego Tony Stark could almost have been specifically created for Robert Downey, Jr. He brings the full weight of his experience to bear on a part that seems almost to become like a second skin for him, at times. Not to imply that the task of assuming a dual identity should be viewed as a burden. Far from it. RDJ is clearly having fun with the chance to put his quirky sensibilities to use in more mainstream fare again, now that he is older and wiser. There are many who would have doubtless echoed the sentiment that he is ""not the superhero type"" when news of his enlistment first broke, but here he proves beyond any doubt that he fits this particular bill perfectly.Alloyed (geddit?!) to a couple of instances of fine casting, there is a story that surprisingly manages to successfully combine an almost fetishistic celebration of badass technology with the altogether simpler drama of human dilemma. We are given a mini robot war at the film's climax for example, that knocks the ENTIRETY of last year's ""Transformers"" squarely on its backside, and demonstrates deftly to Michael Bay the opportunity for emotional investment that he so obviously missed.This is a serving of pre-summer fun with a fair bit of heart behind the machinery. If you're after a blockbuster that boasts a respectable quota of acting talent to its name, then I think you'll find this is one confection knocked together that actually polishes up rather well! Like Iron Man itself, then.","

"Iron Man","jhobdell","1 May 2008","Right from the start (perhaps even beforehand) I was expecting this to be quite special. As usual entertainment is my only requirement of a film for me to like it and this was fabulous. There are so many elements that make it work. In terms of the storyline, there is at least just enough of everything to make it hang together well: enough background to qualify Stark's naivety and arrogance (plus enough of Downey Jr's boyish charm to make him a believable celebrity industrialist!) besides his genius; enough of the water torture scene to make his submission acceptable (and enough visible anger to both drive and carry his deception); there is enough chemistry between Downey Jr and Paltrow to hint at the relationship that never quite blooms; and finally there is enough left hanging to betray a sequel possibly already on the table. Downey Jr largely carries the film in terms of the acting; Paltrow is on fine form but hardly used to her full potential (for a rare but wonderful glimpse of this I recommend ""Proof""). Favreau's almost Hitchcockian cameo is downplayed sufficiently for it not to seem either contrived or haphazard. Ultimately, though, I think my hat is off to Jeff Bridges as possibly the most hate-able villain of the Marvel franchise so far.The use of heavy metal-esquire music for the soundtrack is quite appropriate given the title! And to conclude, the transformation/revelation of most of the characters is remarkable: Stark from self-involved to regretful, Potts from indulgent and condescending to affectionate, Stane from colleague to nemesis. I recognise the possibility of a sequel justifying it, but this didn't quite get to 9 for me purely because the ending is a little too unclosed. That tiny thing aside, this was magic; enjoy!","

"Iron Man","ftyl","13 May 2008","Iron Man is the first feature to be made entirely by Marvel  a gamble which has paid off to the tune of over $350 million worldwide so far. For a non-sequel from a fledgling company that is impressive and bodes well for Marvel's reboot of The Incredible Hulk  due in June. Comic book films are big money spinners now but the success of a new series is predicated on the entertainment value of the central character  and in this way Hulk and Tony Stark have similar problems. They just aren't super enough...Iron Man starts with an unnecessary flashback structure, presumably to ensure some loud action in the first minute or two. Tony Stark (played with now-familiar post-rehab gusto by Robert Downey Jnr.) is the embodiment of the capitalistic, jingoistic American ideal. He has become absurdly rich designing weapons and, more significantly, has no moral qualms whatsoever about the negative effects of his work. Stark is not a nice man. Except he is. This potentially realistic and complex dualistic behaviour is lost in the film's failure to choose sides, leading us to the first of many problems; what are we, the audience, supposed to think of Tony Stark? He is presented as bright and brilliant; a charming man of the people but also as a womaniser and a warlord. This initial confusion is nothing compared to what happens later on. After a brush with death and a subsequent escape (which is accomplished in an ultra-violent fashion) he holds a hippie press conference and vows to stop making weapons for good.This turnaround is simply too fast and, as presented by Downey Jnr. with his usual twinkly-eyed glazed look, has none of the power or angst we have come to expect from comic book origin stories. His parents are not murdered before his eyes, nor is his home world destroyed. He comes across as a petulant child who is bored with his old toys. Instead of using his money to work for peace or help starving children he creates a powered battle suit and flies around the world blowing things up. Exactly how this is 'protecting the people he put in harm's way' is slightly beyond me. And the hypocrisy of the double standard is appalling  it is only when Stark realises that (Shock! Horror!) his weapons might be used against American troops that he begins to examine his conscience.Don't get the wrong idea, there is nothing particularly obnoxious about Iron Man. The performances are light and breezy and the script is a cut about the blockbuster norm; littered as it is with a particularly dry sense of humour. The central performance from Robert Downey Jnr. is the film's saving grace but also its' Achilles heel. His presence is enjoyable on the one hand but, in my opinion, also detracts from the credibility of the whole endeavour. You keep expecting him to wink to camera and finally admit it is some kind of extravagant Saturday Night Live parody. That Jeff Bridges is really being played by Will Ferrell and Terrence Howard is actually just a cardboard cutout. I still don't get Terrance Howard. I've yet to see him raise a palpable, or even guessable, emotion in his roles  his face seems oddly expressionless and his voice almost unbearable. He gets some good lines in this film but sounds like he's reading them from an auto cue. But I digress. As once off summer entertainment this kind of self aware film-making is bearable but I simply can't see the film becoming a much loved classic in the future.So, what does the film have going for it? The special effects are impressive, with the integration of cg and live action especially so. The set pieces, when they come, run the gamut from mundane to genuinely thrilling. Stark's armoured escape from captivity is surprisingly dull while some of the later aerial combat sequences are exciting. Once again though, the use of sfx has positive and negative effects, particularly in relation to the ending. The final confrontation has become a serious problem for the superhero film. In days of yore, special effects were difficult, so typically the best the film had to offer was saved for the ending. Now, every scene is liberally slathered with computer generated gunk. The result is explosive fatigue, a run of overpowering sequences which forgo actual affect for special effect. A dozen astonishingly well-rendered high octane scenes does not create a cumulative effect. If the same level of frankly awe-inspiring cg work is applied to the hero designing and dressing in his suit then what is left for the audience to look forward to. What makes a special effect special these days? The ending of Iron Man is another clunky computer-aided brawl, where narrative is suspended for minutes at a time while increasingly unrealistic pieces of metal and flesh beat on each other. This moment is reminiscent of a dozen other recent movie resolutions: from Hellboy to The Matrix Revolutions, all equally dull. Without vicarious involvement  a sense that a character we can identify with is in danger  it just amounts to so many polygons.Perhaps I've been a little harsh on Iron Man. I can't honestly say I was bored by the experience but I do feel its' major mis-steps are a symptom of a greater malaise at the heart of contemporary blockbuster cinema. If, however, your cynicism has not quite reached the pathological degree mine has you could well have some fun with Iron Man. Robert Downey Jnr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow are amiable enough company (even if the latter seems as though an errant puff of wind would shatter her into a million pieces) and the director, Jon Favreau, keeps things moving at a reasonable pace. Stark's character arc is minimal (more of a character stroll really) but his near trademarked delivery of PG-13 witticisms should be enough to hold your attention. Just.","

"Iron Man","CuriosityKilledShawn","7 February 2012","Despite being a huge hit and a definite crowd-pleaser, Iron Man is actually quite a shallow, unexciting movie. It's not something you can make a night out of watching once you've seen it once. I'd classify it as a movie you can have on while doing the ironing or something. It's a pure cheeseburger movie with no substance at all.Tony Stark (Downey Jnr. in a star-remaking role) is one of the top genius minds on the planet, but when he's captured by generic Arabs he secretly creates a robotic armor costume to break free. Impressed by the suits potential and abilities he refines it upon returning to safe, sunny Malibu. As soon as the suit is ready to go he jets off to Arabistan to kill/subdue the enemy with lots of safe, bloodless action. Beneath this flimsy plot his right-hand man Obediah Stane conspires to steal Stark Industries from right underneath him.There is no depth to Iron Man. The plot involving the Arabs is resolved fairly quickly and the succeeding plot feels like a last-minute afterthought. The Arabs have no mentioned affiliation or motives, since we don't want to scare the kiddies. The action is just a little too cartoonish, and Iron Man himself just looks like a video-game character. There's no tangible edge to this film and very little of it feels real or credible.The ending features the hero and villain inside robotic armor, one lean, one monstrous, clobbering eat other until one of them falls over and doesn't get up again. I'm sure I saw they exact same thing in a movie back in 1990. What was it called again? There's a scene after the credits that sets-up the long, long, long in-development Avengers movie, which I honestly could not care less about.","

"Iron Man","CowherPowerForever","9 April 2015","The Following Review Will Contain Spoilers! Iron Man from the year 2008 marks the first film in a series of Marvel films. This series is now known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Is it the first universe on film? Of course not, but so far the people behind the scenes have crafted something amazing. Iron Man was the first piece in this puzzle. It was a big risk for Paramount at the time, but it payed off into something so big, that Disney had to buy it. The following is my review of Iron Man.Iron Man was written by Matt Holloway, Art Marcum, Hawk Ostby, and Mark Fergus. Fergus and Ostby had actually worked together a few times in the past on some smaller films, and even the 2006 film Children of Men. Since Iron Man was made in 2008, they have worked together on Cowboys & Aliens. Holloway and Marcum also worked together on the 2008 comic book film Punisher: War Zone. A favorite of mine. So they all some good experience before coming on board with this film. Some better than others, but even still.The story follows Tony Stark, a weapons dealer for the United States government. Tony is in the Middle East showing off his new Jericho missile. On his way back to base, his crew is attacked, and Tony is taken hostage. The terrorist leader who had him kidnapped wants Tony to build him one of these Jericho missiles. Tony turns this around to build his first Iron Man suit, and thus escapes back home. During his time in the middle East as a hostage, Tony has second thoughts on selling weapons that kill people. This is where the story really picks up. I don't want to give away the entire story, but the film features some great twists and turns. The villain of the film Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges) is still one of my favorite MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) villains. His character was written greatly, and Bridges was the perfect fit for the role. One of my major issues with the story, is what comes at the end. Again this will be a major spoiler. Tony Stark reveals at the end that he in fact is Iron Man to the public. I did not like this part, and would have liked it more had they gone the traditional route. Either way, the story ended up being amazing, and was a great start to this huge universe. The story writers here deserve big credit.The film was directed by Jon Favreau. Favreau not only directed this film, but also came back to direct the sequel. He is also known for films like Elf, Zathura: A Space Adventure, and Cowboys & Aliens. The film is visually amazing. Though there are times that the CG looks cartoonish. The action scenes are fun, but this is not a big action blockbuster. For about the first forty five minutes or so, there is only light action. Even the final battle between Iron Man and Stane only lasts about five to seven minutes. The story and the characters really carry this film. Which leads me to this fabulous cast of actors. The film is lead by Robert Downey Jr., and co-stars Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Faran Tahir, and so many other actors in smaller roles. After having seen this movie many times since 2008, I still enjoy watching it for the amazing chemistry all the actors had together. Faveau delivered amazing action when the film called for it, it mostly looked nice, and he brought together this great cast of actors and had them make this great film.The film was composed by Ramin Djawadi. He is now known for his amazing score on Pacific Rim. That score is still one of my favorites to this very day. This score however for Iron Man, well it just wasn't that great. It does add some nice depth to the overall film, but it is just a good score, and not a great one. Some may disagree with me on this aspect, but I stand by my opinion. Again, it wasn't bad, just not great as some of his other work.In closing, this is just a fantastic start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man is such a fun and entertaining film that the whole family could likely enjoy. The film has amazing acting, and a great story. There are some aspects to the story and I didn't care for, but nothing that hurts the film. Those wanting to get caught up on the MCU, this is where it all began, and this is a great beginning. It should not disappoint the average movie fan.8/10I will be back to Review the next MCU film in the series, The Incredible Hulk.","

"Iron Man","megoobee","26 May 2013","Let me start off by saying I love this movie, I must have watched it at least 20 times, maybe more. The story was well written and covered life, death, self exploration and rebirth. This was an action movie that took the time to build the story and not rely solely on slam-bam action to keep the audience's attention. Anyone who tells you that they were not moved by Yinsen's death scene is probably not telling the truth. We the audience got to know two Starks, the self indulging, selfish person and a morally correct one. Some questioned his change, others wanted to bury him for it.There is plenty of action but the story is what really raised the bar from average to above average. We see Stark slowly become Iron Man after surviving a few hilarious mishaps and fire extinguisher assaults. We see him struggle with moral conflicts and finally deciding to make a difference. The antagonist twist was nicely done, we are lead to believe that the obvious villain is the main antagonist. Nope, a more sinister character lurked in the background which made the story much more interesting and satisfying.Of all of the ""Avengers"" prequel movies (eg: Thor, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk) this is the best in my opinion. Grab a big glass of your favorite beverage, prepare some microwave popcorn, sit back and be prepare for a couple hours of great entertainment.","

"Iron Man","george.schmidt","5 May 2008","IRON MAN (2008) **** Robert Downey, Jr. , Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Leslie Bibb, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir, Clark Gregg. Rip-roaring big screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics' cult-classic superhero AKA billionaire extraordinaire Tony Stark (Downey having a field day), an industrialist/arms manufacturer who has his eyes opened to the horrors of his financial gains when he is kidnapped by terrorists and manages his escape by creating an armored suit as his ticket to freedom and regrouping by protecting those he has put in harms way. But his sudden moment of clarity has a price to pay in the form of his second-in-command Obadiah Stane (Bridges having a devilish time here) who poses as a formidable foe in the long run. Screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway hammer out a competent, sharp and clever storyline that incorporates origin story cum legend with strong support by director Jon Favreau (who has a bit part as Stark's valet) incorporating stunning ILM CGI, and wisely allowing his actors to shine, particularly Downey's sexy/brainy/snarky Stark with sterling clear-eyed focus and dollops of humor that take off the edge of 'serious'ness, resulting in a humdinger popcorn crowd pleaser and sooth-sayer to the fan boys. Paltrow, in one of her finest turns, is also a breath of fresh air as Stark's personal assistant/love interest Pepper Potts and Howard's unconventional performance as his best bud Jim Rhodes, a military liaison, proves a primer of how a second banana should be played. High-octane thrills and a lot of fun (including the inevitable- and arguably the funniest  Stan Lee cameo) an instant classic and one of the very best comic book adaptations committed to the silver screen; cannot wait for the sequel!","

"Iron Man","sol-","26 May 2017","Based on the iconic comic book character, 'Iron Man' follows a weapons engineer who manufactures a flying armor suit and has to stop those interested in copying the suit for their own evil purposes. Robert Downey Jr. is well cast as the arrogant, wise-cracking protagonist. Shot down in the Middle East, his shock and utter disbelief over his weapons being sold on the black market, causing more harm than good, never quite rings true. His naivety does, however, allow for a solid character progression as he goes from only caring about how much money his company makes to genuinely caring about how his weapons are used. The film spends a refreshingly large amount of time on Downey's back- story too; there are only scattered action scenes during the first half of the movie as the focus is always making Downey's flawed character likable before he turns superhero. The other characters are sadly less interesting. Unrecognisable at first with one zany hairdo, Jeff Bridges has some fun bits, but the likes of Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are given little to do; the film also keeps going back and forth on the possibility of Paltrow as a love interest for Downey. Between the film's robot butler, the in-depth character back-story and Downey's charisma, 'Iron Man' has a lot going in its favour, but whether it is truly one of the better superhero movies out there is debatable.","

"Iron Man","desire_911","4 May 2008","After watching the overblown Spider-Man 3 last year; and the special effects driven Transformers, I was beginning to think that Hollywood didn't know how to make a decent comic book movie anymore. Then Jon Favreau directed Iron Man. The first thing that he does right is casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He brings a presence to the character that only he could and has the greatest one-liners that would even put Spider-Man to shame. Jeff Bridges, Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are also great in their supporting roles. I loved the banter between Pepper and Stark. However, some fans may be disappointed by the lack of CGI and action scenes but I think it works for the better. It's grounded in reality and unlike Transformers, this film has realistic special effects and the CGI seamlessly blends in with all of the practical effects; most notably the Iron Man suit. And after watching Stark tinker around with his first two prototypes (watching the scene in which he tries to fly is priceless), it's a real payoff when after an hour we finally get to see him in action. This makes more sense than other comic book adaptations because we get to see the suit in three different stages. And besides all the action it's the most fun I've ever had watching a movie. There are so many scenes that end with a punch you won't regret watching this with a large audience. Not to mention that it ends on a great note. Also, comic book fans will dig the hints at a sequel and especially the post credit scene. Fans in our theater went crazy. (I won't spoil it for you.) Bottom line, Iron Man Delivers what a good comic book film should. It may not have the brooding darkness of Batman Begins, or the over the top special effects of Transformers, but it's a fun movie that has a terrific blend of humor, a great story, and not to mention some kick-ass action to go along with it. In the end my score is 8.5/10 ""B""","

"Iron Man","ZekeRage911","5 August 2009","I'm often a very cynical, skeptical, pessimistic SOB when it comes to movies, having been horribly disappointed by virtually every comic book movie adaptation to date, so when Iron Man came out, I was prepared for another long camp-fest full of impressive special effects and the sound of Stan Lee stroking himself in the background.Boy was I wrong! Iron man is at times gritty, and at times beautiful, and it blends together so seamlessly you wouldn't think this was a superhero movie. In fact, it's not a super hero movie, it's a movie about a flawed character who realizes he's been a total dupe, and a complete ass, and is so horrified by the consequences of his own ignorance and arrogance that he sets out to try and change things. This is the sort of story that's at the heart of every Marvel Superhero, really, but it's often told so badly that you never really get the point.Spider Man and Spider Man 2 got very close to this, and even went so far as to show that most people are complete ingrates when you go around saving their lives, especially in New York, which might be why Tony Stark lives in Malibu.Robert Downey Junior, a functional alcoholic, falls into the role brilliantly, what with the role being that of a functional alcoholic, and his performance is both charismatic and gripping, making you care about a man you also want to punch out.Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, read: The Bad Guy, and he's got smarmy, greedy bastard practically tattooed on his forehead from shot one. But that doesn't detract from the movie, actually, it feels perfectly natural. Plus he gets points for zooming around on a segue at one point, in a segue scene, oh Jon Favreau, you cheeky son of a...All in all, this is a great movie. It's not Oscar winner material or anything, but I'll watch it any day, over and over, than six minutes of the Phantom Menace.","

Haven't I seen enough of them in my short lifetime? Expecting to be entertained by unimpressed, I decided to watch Iron Man.The first thing I noticed right off the bat was the sharp dialog delivered by the excellent main actor. It was witty, crisp, and not lacking in the least. When I watch a movie, lame dialog is one of the worst things a movie can inflict upon me. Another thing I hate is bad CGI, and this movie had none of that. They pulled out all the stops on this one.I recommend this movie highly, especially if you enjoy really cool explosions. Explosions are an art form, people, and this movie is a work of genius.","

"Iron Man","maharousewagdi","28 May 2021","Bringing another Marvel Comics hero to the big screen, IRON MAN begins as brilliant billionaire industrialist/inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is abducted during a weapons demonstration tour in Afghanistan. Grievously wounded by the very weapons his company manufactures, Stark is forced by his terrorist captors to build a missile; instead, he designs a high-tech suit of armor to make his escape. Returning to America, he wonders how the bad guys got hold of his company's products and vows to set things right with the help of a rebuilt, stylish new iteration of the powered exoskeleton that made his escape possible.Robert Downey Jr. Was perfect for this movie. He has shaped the character in a very good way. You will love his acting skills and his character Tony Stark. The transition from Tony Stark to superhero is great. He first found a friend after being captured by a group of terrorists. He made iron suits to fight the bad guys. The romance between Tony and Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts was fascinating. There was an Arc Reactor that was Tony's artificial heart in the movie. This is one of the most important symbols of MCU. Marvel tried to give the audience suspense which was one of the best things about the movie about the villain character.","

"Iron Man","garlonuss","5 May 2008","I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well.","

"Iron Man","LW-08854","24 December 2023","Iron man, released in 2008, DC had already set about releasing superhero films with dark brooding tones, including Watchmen and Batman begins. Tony Stark however is introduced however as a colourful flamboyant character, headstrong and cocky, a man who enjoys showing off and having his own way.A period of captivity however confronts him with the reality of his actions, his weapons company is not the force for good he believed it was and he decides from now he will focus his money and talent on protecting people. In the spirit of Spider-man (2001) Batman Begins (2004) our protagonist comes to a moment of realization that he must use his abilities to start helping other people and to sort of the bad guys. The film also features a love interest, just like Spider-man and Batman Begins, Iron man also features a love interest who will be put in peril during the final showdown as well as a former friend ally who turns out to be the films true villain. Summed up like this the film sounds a bit formulaic and some of the dialogue during the fight scenes a little by the numbers. However that said, the really strong performances from Robert Downey Jr and Jeff Brides, plus very well directed action sequences and the soundtrack really elevate this movie beyond okay to really very good.","

Special effects still stand, and the storytelling, directing, acting are all on point; there is never a wasted scene, and its relative sober nature compare to the later extravagant MCU flicks helps making it feel a lot more grounded.

"Iron Man","harry_tk_yung","10 May 2008","""I am not the heroic type, clearly"", says Tony Stark in a press conference at the end of the movie. Robert Downey Jr., however, is clearly the best man for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, a comic book character that is at once simple and complex. Genius, multi-billionaire, flamboyant, flippant  RDJ can do that in his sleep. It's when it comes to the complete recklessness of flying to the outer whatever-sphere on a whim that you really love the man.But the movie is not all whims. They have taken their good time in developing the first sequence of captivity and escape. Sure, being able to manufacture the first version of Iron Man in the cave under constantly CCTV surveillance taxes credibility to the limit but you tend to forgive and forget when your attention is drawn to the effective script, neat direction and excellent acting.The dialogue is one cut above the usual Marvel Comic genre, for example, Stark's retort when confronted by a challenging reporter at the beginning of the movie. There are of course also the expected snappy lines such as Stark to bartender, ""Give me a scotch, I'm starving"". Best though is devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) claws-out exchange with the sexy reporter in the morning after the latter's sojourning in Stark's apartment, the bit about taking out the trash.Paltrow's role brings to mind immediately Amy Adams' in ""Charlie Wilson's War"" (2007). While both are devoted personal assistants to a womanizing boss, Adams' character is strictly business while with Peltrow, there is a tantalizing romantic touch, played just right.The special effects are just fine, which is quite a complimentary assessment as it is very difficult today to impress an audience in that department, an audience that has seen everything. ""Iron man"" stands above most others in the genre by offering and telling a good story, playing every card just right and, above all, having Robert Downey Jr.","

The director's obsession with tedious special effects adds to the woes of an awful script. The climactic battle between Good Medium-Sized Iron Man and Bad Over-Sized Iron Man is utterly ridiculous. Downey gives a pretty good performance, keeping this from becoming a total failure. The best thing about the film is the relationship between him and Paltrow.

"Iron Man","WriterDave","6 May 2008","The crown prince of America's premier weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (a sober Robert Downey Jr.) grows a conscience after being captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and decides to fight for what's right in an innovative piece of body armor technology that will henceforth be known as ""Iron Man"" in Jon Favreau's predictable but fun Marvel comic film adaptation.Wisely abandoning the corny mawkishness of the ""Spiderman"" films and the recent attempt to revive the ""Superman"" franchise, ""Iron Man"" instead offers up some light satire, bright-eyed cynicism, and an attempt at witty banter. The always lovely Gwyneth Paltrow is a delight as Stark's sassy assistant Pepper Potts, and it's nice to see her doing something light and fun for a change. Also part of the off-kilter cast are Terrence Howard as Stark's inexplicable military friend and Jeff Bridges bald and bearded as Stark's mentor (and dun dun dun...enemy?) Downey Jr. apparently ad-libbed much of the dialog, which sometimes falls flat, but for the most part works. It's certainly far more enjoyable than the typical fan-boy in-jokes that plague most comic book movies.Certainly this is no ""Batman Begins"" in terms of depth and scope of drama, but with slam-bang special effects and an effortless feel (despite a slow build up to the action), ""Iron Man"" certainly fits the bill as a better than average comic book/action film. Is it any wonder critics and audiences have embraced it so warmly after suffering through loud obnoxious dreck like ""Transformers?"" While it has been a bit oversold, ""Iron Man"" proves that great special effects can be built around a smart story that doesn't have to pander to the lowest common denominator. Until ""The Dark Knight"" it will have to cure our cinematic anemia.","

"Iron Man","ElijahCSkuggs","7 May 2008","So George was wrong. Tony Stark does wear clothing under the armor. I always hoped he was naked. Oh well.Iron Man was a weird time. I enjoyed it overall quite a bit, but there were moments when I just didn't give a damn. My issues are minor, but for nit-picking semi-comic book nerds, they are just. My earlier comic book experiences with Tony Stark gave me a completely different impression. Stark is more of a gentleman like character. And though Downey had to include his attitude into the role, it still worked. One thing I did not care for in the slightest was the News Reporter gal. Her role was annoying (I get it), much too distracting and just a weak part of the script. And she never got her ""come-up-ins"". Stupid chick even interrupted when she wasn't supposed to! She should have been booted outta there! There were a couple talky parts, I suppose to add depth to the friendships, but overall they were just boring and felt unneeded. Again, minor issues that don't take anything away from the main aspects to the film.But the action, special effects and acting by Downey and Bridges were all really good. Actually it may have the best effects I've seen yet in a super hero movie. But ya can't forget about the effects in Howard the Duck. And Favreau did a decent enough job as well. Overall, this should be a really fun on-going Marvel movies series. If you want an entertaining, great looking action flick, look no further.","

"Iron Man","classicsoncall","12 May 2008","So here I am in my late fifties with enough of a connection to my comic book collecting past to be intrigued by modern day super hero films. Now I was never a Marvel Comics geek, my favorite characters were the mainstays of the DC Comics universe, like Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, et al. But if you were a fan, you couldn't help but know about the alternative universe that contained Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The X-Men and Iron Man, which brings us to the subject at hand. I thought that the movie did a credible job of spanning the forty year comic book history of Iron Man about as well as could be expected in a distilled down two hour movie. Particularly effective was the way we see how the origin costume in the picture pays tribute to the early Iron Man years, while the modern day red and gold armor conveys the advance of science and technology into the twenty first century. Comic book purists will most likely have serious issues with the picture, but I've been able to get over the whole faithfulness to continuity issue some time ago. What I'm looking for in a flick like ""Iron Man"" is an opportunity to be entertained for a couple of hours, and there's enough here to have some fun and be just that - entertained.The one thing I AM looking for in the Marvel universe pictures is the ubiquitous cameo appearance of Stan Lee, creator of many of the comic book icons we recognize today. He's incorrectly credited in the cast listing as I write this, as he's listed appearing as himself. What you need to do is pay attention to that party scene in the casino when Tony Stark says hi to 'Hef'. That was just the coolest way to get Stan into the picture, and I give him a lot of credit for not taking himself too seriously as he truly is one of the gods of comic book history.As for the picture, it's easy enough to bash it for it's adherence to current world events and the milieu of extremist terrorism. But is that any worse than reliving the events of the early 1960's and placing the character in the middle of the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? The present day Iron Man can be a product of his time and still be effective as a symbol of patriotism and honor, even while the rest of the country is immersed in presidential primaries and partisan politics.You have to give credit to the selection of Robert Downey Jr. for the Iron Man role. Perhaps his own bouts with substance abuse uniquely prepared him for an outstanding performance as the conflicted title character. However the character I was intrigued with the most was Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, I just couldn't get over his appearance as Tony Stark's operations chief. The role was played with just the right amount of reserve and just below the surface malice; I thought he did an excellent job. Gwyneth Paltrow had pretty much a thankless job as Stark's personal assistant and secret admirer and it didn't seem to me that her performance was all that stand out.As an aside, the one thing I feel I do have to comment on is a personal gripe of mine relative to the IMDb ranking system. As I write this, ""Iron Man"" sits at number #130 of the all time best films as ranked by current users. It seems to me that the way fans line up behind a picture even before it's released, there ought to be a moratorium of say, two or three years before a new release could be eligible for Top 250 ranking. When you consider the truly great films of all time like ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"", it's hard for me to reconcile a popcorn flick like this one to be considered in the same breath. I feel the same way (as to a voting moratorium) about stunning pictures like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"". If a picture has the legs to stand up as an all time great, it will be remembered a couple years after it's original release. Remember all the fanboy hype about ""Serenity""? Does anyone even care about that picture today? See what I mean?","

"Iron Man","hanalisss","4 December 2023","Iron Man stands as a cinematic marvel, no pun intended, and it's not just the armor that shines. This film, directed by Jon Favreau, is a masterclass in modern superhero storytelling that laid the foundation for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).It succeeds due to Robert Downey Jr.'s tour de force performance as Tony Stark. He effortlessly embodies the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, bringing a charismatic and witty energy to the character that is nothing short of iconic. The casting choice was a stroke of genius, and Downey Jr.'s portrayal is one for the ages.The narrative arc of Tony Stark's transformation from a self-absorbed arms dealer to the selfless hero we come to admire is expertly crafted. The character development is palpable, and we witness Stark's evolution both physically and emotionally. The script balances humor, action, and heart with finesse, creating a film that resonates on multiple levels.The visual spectacle is breathtaking. The CGI work on the Iron Man suits is groundbreaking, making the superhero tech feel tangible and awe-inspiring. The suit-up sequences are iconic, and the action scenes are both exhilarating and visually stunning. The film strikes a perfect balance between intimate character moments and high-octane superhero action.Moreover, the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges as the formidable Obadiah Stane, delivers stellar performances that complement Downey Jr.'s lead. The chemistry between characters feels genuine, adding depth to the film's emotional beats.Iron Man is not just a superhero film; it's a cultural phenomenon that redefined the genre. It laid the groundwork for the interconnected storytelling that became the MCU's trademark. From its engaging narrative to the charismatic lead, impressive visuals, and memorable supporting cast, it remains a cinematic triumph, setting the gold standard for superhero movies and kickstarting a franchise that would go on to dominate the global box office.","

"Iron Man","DarthVoorhees","9 May 2008","I honestly didn't know what to expect with this film. Marvel has been very hit and miss as of late and I really think that the last truly great film they made was Spider-Man 2 04. Iron Man is a treat and a reprieve from the Ghost Riders, Electras', Blade Trinitys', and Spider-Man 3s' of recent years. Robert Downey Jr IS Iron Man. He is absolutely outstanding in the title role of Tony Stark. He has a huge on-screen presence and he is really what drives this movie which has an outstanding cast. He captures the persona of the Stark character perfectly. Some say it is because they have similar character traits and I simply don't think that's true. Tony Stark is the anti-superhero and you have to be clever and witty to make him appeal to the audience who expects the Romantic good guy in a quest against evil. Stark builds his new suit out of curiosity to see how far the limits could be pushed rather than doing it out of a conviction to fight off villains. The last exchange between Stark and Pepper is a direct parody of the entire Spider-Man film series. Stark is not your average hero and he makes it known. They remain faithful to Stark's personality and thus the movie can offer the audience a treat in the world of summer superheroes.The story of Iron Man was written as a critique of the Cold War ideas but the story transfers verily well to our modern War on Terror. Stark is a patriot and when he sees his weapons being fired on American soldiers he gains the conviction to become something better than what he once was. There is some critique of weaponry and war but it is mainly about how Tony comes to the realization that war must be used for the right reasons and he comes to this through his capture in the film's beginning. Starks reaction to seeing his weapons in the hands of terrorists is portrayed very well by Downey. We are able to see inside the real Tony Stark past the playboy.The special effects are realistic. ILM shows that they don't need superheros to be in the dark to make them look like living breathing beings.My complaint about the film is the final battle. The dialogue and the fight choreography are bad enough to be in your Saturday morning cartoon. Jeff Bridges is an immensely talented actor and to hear him deliver pitiful cliché lines is somewhat of a disappointment.","

"Iron Man","jemps918","1 May 2008","Surprisingly fun! The trailer definitely underpromised and overdelivered. Watched Iron Man as requisite summer movie blockbuster viewing; ended up happily enjoying it. The incredibly talented Robert Downey Jr. made Iron Man work by animating the character with his own inherent eccentricities.Iron Man draws several parallels with other superheroes. For one, he has a lot in common with Batman. Just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a rich, orphan playboy gifted with the aptitude for high technology. Instead of having the elderly Alfred as butler, however, Stark has personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), a pair of artificially intelligent robots (adorable scene stealers that have adapted puppy-like personalities) and best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). Just like Superman, he sleeps with a reporter, Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb), and has someone close to him for his arch nemesis.Writer/actor/producer/director Jon Favreau is a revelation, helming this action-adventure flick with disarming deftness; it's clear he enjoyed directing this film. How can he not with an unexpectedly well-written, relevant script and a talented cast that includes the chameleon-like Jeff Bridges and cameos from Stan Lee and Samuel L. Jackson. The special effects are excellent and the editing was just right, even if it runs over two hours. Overcoming its corny name, Iron Man has all the makings of a successful franchise!","

But this all changes when he goes to Afghanistan to show off his latest weapon and is taken hostage by terrorists and forced to build a weapon for them. Instead, he builds a super-hero suit and uses it to break free and go back to America, where he reveals a change of heart in relation to his profession and tries to aim his talents more at peace than war. But this doesn't go down well with his boss Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who's only worried about the profits they will lose now Tony no longer wants to make weapons. And when Tony learns that his company has been making under-handed deals with the men who held him captive, he uses the super-hero suit he made once again and becomes Iron Man. But his corrupt boss has ideas of his own in regards making his own super-hero suit...You can always count on a good super-hero film to fill in the obligatory summer blockbuster slot in the filmic year, and this year we have this adaptation of one of Marvel Comic's truly lesser known creations, which just shows how far towards the bottom of the barrel we're scraping. An ambitious piece that seems to have caught onto the trend of making extra long summer blockbusters, this tries to invest a lot of unnecessary depth and characterization into a story that's ultimately not worth the effort.It just feels overlong instead of something really special. Okay, Iron Man isn't your typical action hero. He doesn't just magically get his super powers like Superman or Spider-Man, we see him struggle to get his super-suit to work, failing to guide it properly and make the special gadgets work, but the whole piece just feels overly labourious, with an uninvolving, predictable script that fails to rise out the ground.Cast wise, in the lead role, Downey Jr. is an odd but admittently effective choice, a snazzy, cynical anti hero who slowly sees through his own BS but he's just not enough to keep the whole boat afloat. Bridges is also a decent choice as the villain, but the weak script fails to make the most out of him, while in support rising star Terrence Howard goes through the motions as a comic relief Air Force colonel and Gwyneth Paltrow is noticeable as a personal assistant with a ridiculous name.All these type of films just seem so manufactured nowadays, with so much back story stretching them out so long and enough publicity to guarantee a great opening weekend and an obligatory equally inferior sequel a year or so later. For all it's quantity instead of quality, Iron Man truly has an Iron Soul. **","

"Iron Man","Slarkshark","28 January 2024","'Iron Man' starts the MCU off with a big bang, and over 30 movies later, it still holds up as one of it's best entries.I remember before this came out there was a lot of uncertainty and trepidation. RDJ had previously hit rock bottom and was in no way regarded as a bankable star. Favreau wanted him and had vision. He had faith in RDJ and the character of Stark/Iron Man.It's hard to believe, but Iron Man was not a well known character to non comic book people and it was a gamble kicking off a possible franchise with a relatively unknown character. I'd say it paid off. Also, comic book movies were not trending at that time, and had a recent rough history, with few successes. Since then, this movie and everything to follow completely changed the movie landscape, for better or worse.Terrance Howard was a great Colonel Rhodes and it's too bad he got greedy. I would have really liked to see him carry on the role. Don Cheadle has been a good replacement though, so I don't really have any complaints. Maybe Howard comes back in the multiverse?","

"Iron Man","dvc5159","1 May 2008","With this film, Marvel's little known comic book superhero is immortalized. The film is big, spectacular, fun, grandiose... in every sense.Robert Downey Jr is terrific as Stark as he shows charm, wit, brains and brawn. His lines are spot on and he brings seems to make Stark into his own, as they have similar traits, making him blend well into his character and making it likable. Jeff Bridges does a convincing Job as the villain. Terrence Howard is okay as Stark's Air Defense pal, and it's nice to see Gwyneth Paltrow in a major film after a long absence, she is simply adorable in this film.The special effects are nicely handled and realistic, and it shows the film's $150 million budget. To quote a fellow reviewer, it's nice to see the use of CGI to the fullest and utmost extent, especially the construction of the suit. The action sequences are handled nicely thus provide excellent eye candy, making them exhilarating. Kudos to director Jon Favreau for really keeping his promise.Great lines, great actors, excellent action scenes and special effects, this movie has the ingredients of a popcorn masterpiece. See it with a bunch of friends, who knows, I'll maybe see it again. This is an excellent way to start the summer, and also the best superhero film since 2005's ""Batman Begins"", and that's saying something.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall value: 8.9/10Delton","

"Iron Man","neil-476","1 May 2008","First things first - I have never had an Iron Man comic, I don't think - Iron Man is simply an incidental character in other comics I've read. Kind of like Marvel's Aquaman (although I have at least had some Aquaman comics from time to time). So I'm pretty unfamiliar with Iron Man's mythology, origin, supporting cast etc., and I'm therefore not in a position to say whether the movie is faithful to its origins or not. I'm simply approaching it as a generic super-hero movie.There is much to like in this film, although I came out entertained but not jazzed. Downey is great, the effects are mostly fine, Bridges is a very good duplicitous villain, the chemistry between Downey and Paltrow is good, and there are some nice moments in the script. And I was surprised to find it was 2 hours, it felt more like 90 minutes as it whizzed by.But it left me curiously unmoved, unengaged. I didn't care that much about these characters. On an overall entertainment level I would put it on a par with the FF movies, with the key distinction that the relationship between the FF meant that you did care about them. Not so here.Having said that, the ""first night out"" in the revamped suit is GREAT - really fun and exhilarating.","

"Iron Man","chera_khalid","2 October 2023","Iron Man, the blast that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the stratosphere, and oh, did it soar. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark is a magnetic force, blending genius with a hefty dose of charisma that had me rooting for the billionaire playboy turned armored hero. The film editing is as slick as Stark's engineering prowess, seamlessly building the arc reactor of a narrative that powers the entire MCU. Strengths? The origin story done right, giving us not just a superhero but a flawed and charming human beneath the metal suit. Weaknesses? The plot occasionally veers into predictable territory, but it's forgivable when the repulsor beams start firing. The music, Ramin Djawadi's score, is the sonic blueprint of heroism, turning every suit-up sequence into a symphony of metal on metal. Cinematography captures the glitzy tech world and the gritty reality of Stark's transformation, creating a visual feast for comic book enthusiasts. The message? A reminder that even the most brilliant minds can find redemption in doing good for the world. 8/10 is an Iron Man armor-grade salute to its game-changing brilliance, a film that not only kickstarted a cinematic universe but also made us believe in heroes in high-tech armor.","

"Iron Man","veensepeper","29 November 2014","After seeing the first 'Iron Man' again recently, I can't believe how far the MCU has strayed from this. The one that started it all, and it is hard to believe it takes place in the same universe as other Marvel movies - such as Guardians of The Galaxy.Although 'Iron Man' definitely has its fantastic elements, it is all grounded into a deep level of realness. And in keeping it real lies the refreshing bit. The realness makes the funny more funny, the amazing more amazing, and the emotional more emotional. And due to how much the movie is grounded in reality, you'll believe a man can fly.Arms-manufacturer Tony Stark is captured by terrorists, who appear to own several of his creations. After his escape, Stark turns a new leaf, shutting down the weapons department of his company. Instead of building weapons of destruction, he becomes a vigilant knight in shiny armor (with lasers and repulsors).All in all, it is a very good origins story. The acting by Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Palthrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges is outstanding - the witty dialogue alone makes for a good movie.Not only is 'Iron Man' the start of an Iron Man franchise, it is also the birth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie brings up a lot of key elements for the later to appear Avengers movie: Enter Iron Man. Enter the Arc Reactor. Enter Agent Coulson. Enter S.H.I.E.L.D. And do stay and watch until the end of the credits, for something that created massive nerd-gasms back in the day.","

Robert Downey Jr. Takes on the role of Tony Stark an inventor (genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist) he plays the character remarkably, still one of my favourite movies of his.Iron man is a great adventure that you are bound to stay entertained for the whole duration of the movie, if you have not yet seen this i highly recommend it! I felt very entertained the whole way throigh, remember to stick sround for that post credit scene if you're new to Marvel.Highly recommend! Now continue the MCU adventure.","

"Iron Man","merdiolu","22 October 2008","One asks himself what if Marvel or DC Comics did not exist what would become Hollywood ? I mean once had been cradle of art and creativity these studios are throwing their resources , talents and investments to make clichéd worn out predictable comic book adaptations nowadays. In a few instances they are OK in artistic sense due to talented acting , decent and deep characterization and finely balanced dramatic writing with CGI or special effects are as required nothing more nothing less. (no matter how impressive they are)Unfortunetely Iron Man does not belong to this category. This is a movie produced and edited as a video clip. It has every cliché imaginable expected from a big but empty headed Hollywood blockbuster inspired from comic book aimed for 15 year olds. Cartoonish characters , sterile environment , lots of CGI , lame jokes/humor , unbelievably silly story (he made a super powerful weapon suit inside a cave ? PLEASE !!!) , hot chicks , fast cars , US Army being source of goodness around the world , swarthy Middle Eastern looking like bad guys who are evil just sake of it ( and getting their asses kicked of course as always) , an arch villain who boasts a lot , a final boss level showdown where superhero thriumps without any cost or after consequence....I understand there are lots of fans of that kind of things but frankly I am bored with them...I can endure even ignore clichés or predictability if movie presented something new , unique or original...Nope everything went down exactly I predicted above.....As for acting it is hit and miss really...Robert Downey Jr. shows a really decent performance here since his character Tony Stark is the center of story. Unfortunetely his character is nothing more than a Bruce Wayne wannabe. Mrs Patrow is usual damsel in distress...Jeff Bridges is usual uber nemesis without maniacal laugh or mustache twirling (he does have a beard though) Terence Howard is just awful. He doesn't have even a slight military presence....I see this as a trend....Comic book superhero adaptations just aimed to entertain and please fans of genre or very young or sub educated people who can be dazzled with CGI , explosions and awful characterization/dialog. Due to money making reasons (undeniable result of Hollywood becoming an industry to make profit) it is a popular trend now but this is not cinema.....I do not see a future for Iron Man (in creative sense) except a few sequels then audience will probably shift to next superhero like Superman , Spider Man , Hulk , Fantastic Four etc or its sequel/remake....They are basically same unfortunately...","

"Iron Man","Otterman_MK2","8 August 2012","Typically Iron Man is not the type of superhero movie I would enjoy, the only 'light' superhero movies I have genuinely enjoyed in the past being the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. With Christopher Nolan's dark realistic Batman movies paving the way of example to other films in the superhero genre, director Jon Favreau embraces a realistic tone whilst keeping the movie far lighter and more humorous in tone than Batman. And like most, I was pleasantly surprised with Iron Man, and despite its notable flaws, the film has made its way to being one of my favourite superhero films of all time. The film is, first and foremost, a long title sequence telling the origin story of Iron Man, the film's key fundamental theme being about realisation and – for past sins. In this case, the sins of billionaire playboy Tony Stark, played by the perfectly-cast Robert Downey Jr. Tony Stark is an arrogant, but made very likable due to Robert Downey Jr.'s fine performance, who is kidnapped by terrorists using the weapons he created, and imprisoned in a cave where he is forced to build a deadly weapon- The Jericho Missile- to help the terrorists in their plot. During this time, Stark is given a wake-up call in which he realises he must take responsibility for the power these terrorists hold, having previously been blindingly ignorant to what is being sold on the black market. There is a bittersweet irony in, not only the realisation that the terrorists gained power through his creations, but the fact that Tony's heart was injured by one of his own weapons- an injury which requires him to wear a power cell-like 'arc reactor' to keep him alive for the rest of his life. This makes not only for an interesting story, but a great motivation for Tony Stark to fight this evil, and a motivation the audience can feel equally enthusiastic about. As the films progresses and Tony returns to his home in America, the story continues the same concept by revealing more about how Stark's company has supplied these terrorists with weapons, but refuses to go in any other direction. For a summer blockbuster the storyline is lacking in fuel to keep itself going, the current story- that feels more like a concept, designed as an excuse to put Tony in the Iron Man suit and place a few action scenes in the film- wears down quickly, leading to a messy Transformers-like climax which feels out of tone with the rest of the film. The action scenes themselves were impressive, with incredibly realistic CGI on the Iron Man suit, beautiful cinematography and were genuinely adrenaline-fuelled fun, with exception to the clunky finale. However, the scenes were rationed throughout the films, appearing as a quick 'rush' in the film's pacing, before reverting back to a regular movie. Appreciating Jon Favreau's comfort zone and experience lies in the field of comedy, it was a good safe decision to ration the action scenes like he did, but the fact that they were so fun to watch and well-shot left me wanting more.The strength of the film really lies in Tony's physical and metaphorical transformation into Iron Man and the chemistry between the three central characters- Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges villainous Obadiah Stane. All three give top-class performances, and prevent the movie's pacing from falling flat. Composer Ramin Djawadi's score for the film is also highly commended, giving a suitable mixture of modern and orchestral, reflecting the film's swapping between Tony Stark and Iron Man/ smaller scenes and action scenes. Ultimately it feels very special, adds a good dose of humour and enjoys itself whist taking the core themes seriously, features great acting, but really could have done with a better ending than two people in suits engaging in a fist-fight.","

"Iron Man","dragonmysterious","1 May 2013","Before this film, Iron Man was only known amongst comic book fans. This film did a great introduction to Iron Man. Iron Man's origins is based very closely on the comics and done very well.Robert Downey is perfect for the role of Iron Man. Without the suit, its basically Robert playing himself. The film took its time and did not rush through its plot. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane was pretty well done too. This film was a great set-up and showed that it is a great idea to introduce more less-well-known superheroes among the public. The film took its time to show Iron Man learning to use the suit like Spider-man, but in its own unique way. It does a great job of foreshadowing future plots like ""The Ten Rings"" and Rhodey looking at a suit and be like ""Maybe next time"". The comedic elements supported the plot well. In conclusion, this film lives up to its expectations for comic book fans, and introduced a new character, or specifically, a new franchise to movie fans/non-comic book fans. Though not as epic as Nolan's Batman films which have a darker tone, this is a good family film and it is very enjoyable.","

"Iron Man","dbborroughs","4 May 2008","I loved it...do you need more than that? Okay the comic geek who red a huge chunk of every appearance of the character was pleased in spirit if not in action. Like the first time we saw and heard Wolverine's claws come out in the first X-Men movie, the moment that kind of sold me was when the camera pulls back to reveal Tony's mansion-and it was Tony's mansion (Later the comic book team Avengers' west coast headquarters). At that point I knew it was all okay, at that moment the geek went away and said they got it right and calmed down.yea its an origin story and yea you know how its going to come out- but the neat thing is there is a sense of danger, that everything may not be okay-hey Tony is injured in the opening minutes so you know he can and will be hurt. I love that its an origin story that hasn't been done to death-thank god Ironman was never Spiderman so his origin was never the stiff of endless spoofs and rip offs. Best of all I love the characters. All of the characters are there and they are real. Sure there is slight modification for the real world but they are there and you care about them- so much so that the action almost seems like an intrusion into the rest of the film. I especially liked Jeff Bridges as Obediah Stane. At last he gives a real performance and not one of his lispy toss off appearances of late. Here we have a wonderful evil man.I don't want to spoil it by saying too much...If I have any complaints- and there are two- its first that the film is almost too breezy. Its moves like the wind from start to finish with Robert Downey giving one hell of a central performance (He holds it all together). However the problem is that the meat seems to be missing-or at least invisible. Yes I know its not needed but I would have loved to have seen more of the back stories and subplots hinted at and that bleed off the screen. I love that the world and the people all exist outside the film-however I wished we could have seen more(though I know that would have slowed or killed the flow of the film). My second complaint is that the effects are at times too CGI. Its not so much the look- but the weight-when we see the later suits in action they don't have a real world weight. Its a nit pick, but it bothered me that such a wonderfully fun film missed something so tiny.Still I loved it- 9 out of 10 on the pure fun scale. No it ain't high art but it is a great thrill ride-and as for the post credits bit- Oh yea I'm there.","

"Iron Man","gargamel_gargamel","8 May 2008","Ironman, huh? Never heard of the premise.... though I assume it was a Marvel comic at some point. So I had no expectations going in other than I like Downey Jr and Jeff Bridges... so it had that going for it already. And it looked fun.Fun it is. The acting from these 2 guys was good. I caught myself hearing hints of The Dude in Jeff Bridges sometimes, but any Big Lebowski fan is going to pick that out..... it is unavoidable! He pulled it off excellently. Jr did very well with his part and was mostly very believable. I was impressed with Paltrow. She usually doesn't do it for me, but she looked unbelievably sexy in this role, especially the charity event scene with the backless dress (you'll see). Oh, and she did a good job with the acting also.The story is pretty good.... and like I said... fun. There are parts that dragged on a little bit, especially at the beginning. I thought the movie would have been better had it been about 20 minutes shorter. There were parts when I was thinking... okay, I know what's going on, let's just move on to the next scene already. However, like I said... more towards the beginning. Once the story gets rolling it keeps you interested. There are some great action scenes, you just have to put aside your logic for the flying stuff... but... it's a comic book so....On the Gargamel scale it gets 1 for story 1 for acting 1 for car chase (but it's more of an air chase, and it's cool) 1.5 for guns/explosions and 0 for the nudity score... there is not full nudity but there is some implication that is pretty sexy.. wow, so that's a 4.5 which equates to a 9 on the IMDb scale. I'm surprised myself..","

"Iron Man","Lejink","24 July 2009","Actually, I feel quite well qualified to rate this movie as, being a big comic-book fan (although more DC than Marvel!), I'd digested Marvel's ""Essential Iron Man"" re-print of all the early Stan Lee penned Iron Man comics just before this film appeared. Given my belief that, with few exceptions, movie-goers (at least mature ones like me, I suspect) prefer less crash-bang action in their super-hero flicks and more characterisation and plot, (which you invariably tend to get in origin-type stories), this film is all the better for being of that ilk.It has plenty of faults too though, which I'll get off my chest post-haste. Firstly, whilst respecting that the original Iron Man comic creation was born at the time of the Cold War and doesn't shy away from painting Iron Man's enemies as often originating from Red China or Soviet Russia, while this is okay in comicdom, I was uneasy at setting what is basically a super-hero confection in war-torn Afghanistan, especially at this particular time with the conflict far from over and US & UK casualties rising.Secondly, Iron Man isn't the most original of heroes, borrowing the playboy image of Batman's Bruce Wayne and the humanitarian angst of Spider Man's Peter Parker. Also, the movie gets off to a fairly unpleasant start, with an unnecessary rock soundtrack in tow, with a gratuitous celebration of mega-rich Stark's opulent lifestyle, where women are just ""what's your name again"" objects of desire or easy conquest, as even a hard-nosed but attractive journalist falls too easily for Stark's dubious charms.Thirdly, there's Gwynneth Paltrow who non-acts her way throughout as Stark's ""Miss Moneypenny"", Pepper Potts, who in the comics blossoms from prim & proper secretary to a dazzling beauty, which certainly doesn't happen here. And yes I could have done without the sub-Transformers action climax between Iron Man Marks 1 & 2, but I guess you have to give the teens something to watch at the finish. Strange also to see Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan restricted to almost ""extra"" status - in the comics he's every bit as important to Stark as Pepper and indeed is jealous of her feelings for Stark. Ironically this part is, I see, played by director Favreau himself! And yes, while it's de rigeur for blockbusters like this, the in your face product placement does grate (Audi & McDonald's prominent amongst them).On the plus side though, there's Robert Downey, cool as anything in the lead role. Thankfully he rarely dons the Iron Man armour so he gets to act a lot, definitely a plus. Ditto an almost unrecognisable, let's be generous, somewhat filled out Jeff Bridges as Stark's double-dealing mentor Obadiah Stane. The dialogue is invariably snappy and quick-fire, with occasional stabs of humour permeating through. I do feel though the director missed out on a possibly humorous King King moment as Stane, by now having his Doctor Octopus moment in donning the recreated prototype Iron Man armour, menaces Paltrow's Potts. The closing revelation by Stark as to his alter ego is also up there with Indiana Jones shooting of the ""whipmaster"" in the surprise stakes, certainly I don't recall Stark revealing his identity in the comics.Best of all though is the armour, which films great in burnished red and gold. Downey's extended scenes where he attempts to master his equipment are probably the best in the film and the special effects in general are at the top-end of the scale.So there you have it, another successful addition to Hollywood's roster of comicdom and no doubt a relief to Mavel after the comparative failure of big name dramatisations like Daredevil, The Hulk (twice) and the Fantastic Four.","

"Iron Man","ossie85","6 April 2023","Iron Man, now 15 years old (I'm old), is an excellent movie that introduced the world to Tony Stark, the billionaire industrialist who builds a pimped out suit of iron and transforms into a superhero. The film was a game-changer and revolutionized the superhero movie genre, and how to create an interconnected universe.The acting in this film is top-notch, led by Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark as an arrogant, quick-witted, and charming hero. Downey perfectly captures the character's transformation from a selfish and ruthless businessman to a hero who is willing to put his life on the line to save others. I still believe Downey deserved recognition at the Oscars for his iconic portrayal.The storyline is very engaging, with a perfect blend of humor, action, and emotion that set the tone for over a decade worth of movies. The direction by Jon Favreau is excellent, and the special effects are impressive. The film manages to balance the spectacle of the explosions and action scenes with the depth of the characters and their relationships.The supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as James Rhodes, and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, are all excellent and bring depth to their respective roles. A pity Howard didn't return, and that Bridges is a one and done character.Overall, Iron Man is a must-watch for fans of the superhero genre. The movie is well-crafted, entertaining, and manages to be both fun and meaningful. Iron Man truly set the tone for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it still stands as one of the best superhero movies of all time.","

The story just felt like another typical superhero story and I kind of wanted to stop watching the movie halfway through. I know it's obviously supposed to be a fiction movie, but it didn't feel realistic how Tony made the Iron Man costume and it felt like lazy writing.

"Iron Man","rbrb","14 May 2008","The special effects in this picture are good but not much else worth saying that about this movie. It is made for people with juvenile minds or for those who take comfort in reading comics. The plot so called is about a super rich and clever arms' dealer who decides that he will create an iron 'superman' to fight what he perceives to be injustice. Where this movie errs badly it is pure and ridiculous science fantasy yet it brings in real life war torn Afghanistan and starts preaching politics and other self interested propaganda. The lead actor and actress are totally miscast and are wholly unconvincing; she thinks by just posing she is putting in a decent performance which she does not, and he is no hero and neither acts nor looks the part. The film is far too long. 3/10","

"Iron Man","thesar-2","10 January 2010","I really wanted to reward one of the best superhero movies with a higher rating than just 8/10 stars, but each time I've seen this (now on the 5th time,) I can't get past the two major flaws and one scene, though incredibly original, I didn't personally 100% care for.Let's get the negatives out of the way, because the positives thoroughly outweigh the minor downfalls of Iron Man. #1: The story is just too damned old, familiar and makes it not only predictable, but very A-B-C. #2: The so-called ""villain"" is so foreseen, even for the first viewing, that it's funny they should even put in the ""surprise"" scene. The scene that was original, but I'm on the fence with, was the last few seconds of the film. It's hard not to give away the spoiler, but since the trailer for Iron Man 2 specifically lays it out, it's Stark (Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity.I grew up on superheroes, namely, Superman, and one of my favorite aspects, if not the #1, is the secret identity part. Of course it can be considered unrealistic – uh, glasses and the farm-boy stance hardly makes Superman invisible, especially to his ""incredibly brilliant and reporter"" partner. So, I'll give it to Iron Man as it would be hard not to put two-and-two together and they were doing just that in the finale's press conference. But, now the fun's gone and I strongly worry, though still curious, about the direction part two's going to take.Okay, glad that's over. The #1 best thing about Iron Man: Downey Jr. He made this movie. Literally without him, this would be just another run of the mill Superhero film. His wit, depth and incredibly funny one-liners shoot this film up to the top 10 (if not 5) best superhero movies. In addition, Paltrow did a great job (up to her nervous fumbling in the closing) of bouncing very nicely off him, as he did with the robots, as well. Bridges, as much as I like him, wasn't a great part of the film. I wouldn't go as far as to say he was miscast – on the contrary, for the character he played, he did fit the part. But, he was just, well, there. Nothing special. Howard's the same and I'm not sad to see him go for the second movie.Back to Downey Jr. If the opening hilarious ""taxi"" ride doesn't grab you with his humor, stance and instant charisma, you might as well turn the movie off. Sure, the action's good, in fact, most of its great, but I strongly believe he made the movie.Stark is an alcoholic, rich, spoiled, womanizing, sarcastic and incredibly smart engineer who heads up his deceased father's weapon company until he gets a change of ""heart"" while captured, tortured and forced to break free with the Iron Man 1.0 model. After the initial transformation of Stark (inside and out) the movie plays out like almost every other superhero/comic book origin story – again, with the exception of the phenomenal performance of Downey Jr.Not my favorite superhero – like I said, I like the change the superhero has to QUICKLY go through to save the day and here, like Batman, it's a long drawn out process. (I will say this though, they must've known people might have a problem with that because they made it sincerely interesting, despite time-consuming.) But, they definitively got a new fan here to the decades old hero.I do look forward to #2 as well as any kind of Avengers movie with Iron Man – as long as Downey Jr. plays Stark. I can't imagine anyone else stepping into those ""not-really"" Iron Shoes. (I could see them cutting costs on that Avengers movie with Iron Man now played by Freddie Prinze Jr. Save your role-stealing to Jack Bauer. Another character you'll never replace.)","

Iron Man is an amazing film that blew me away. I thought I was going to be let down because of all the hype but it's become one of my favorite super hero movies. So if you're wondering if it lives up to all the hype, the answer is a very enthusiastic ""yes."" I was very impressed with the storyline and I loved how well everything was tied together. A lot of super hero, and just action films is general, seem to focus so much on action sequences that they don't really have much time to focus on story and this movie wasn't like that at all. It created a great story. The acting was fantastic also. Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow and everyone else were amazing. I also thought the CGI and special effects were done very well. I usually hate CGI but I really loved the look of it in this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie.I am a big fan of the first Spiderman, the Batman films, the X-Men films, and Superman films and this one definitely deserves to be placed with those. It is the best super hero movie to come along lately and I can't till it's on DVD so I can purchase it. Go see it while it's still in theaters and for once, believe the hype!","

"Iron Man","MrGKB","8 May 2008","...thanks to a remarkably coherent script from four guys (usually a sign of last-minute rewrites and trouble in River City), some seriously immaculate production and visual design (from outfits like The Orphanage, ILM, and Stan Winston Studio), and most of all a sterling performance from Robert ""Weird Science"" Downey, Jr. as genius mega-tycoon Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Downey has had quite the roller-coaster career, and ""Iron Man"" is going to be one of its peaks, no question. He's pitch perfect, occupying the role like nobody's business, and although his transition from smug, self-involved war profiteer to conscience-stricken humanitarian seems little more than a pragmatic result of nearly being done in by his own weaponry, and leaves the audience wondering just how naive this wunderkind is in the first place, Downey plays the absurdity of it all with both good-natured relish and a certain restraint.Director Jon ""Elf"" Favreau elicits more than competent performances from the rest of his cast as well. Gwyneth ""Proof"" Paltrow fills Stark's gal Friday ""Pepper"" Potts' shoes with grace and a smoldering promise of things yet to come in the inevitable sequel (get your free hint at the end of the credits reel), while Jeff ""Starman"" Bridges genially gobbles scenery as the bad guy.

Color me bemused!), but Shaun ""Crash"" Toub is excellent as Stark's savior in Afghanistan, and Clark ""We Were Soldiers"" Gregg will no doubt enjoy more to do as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent under the command of Samuel L. Jackson.Anyway, as the first genuine blockbuster of the summer, ""Iron Man"" serves perfectly. Plenty of action, but not tiringly so, a script that mostly treats its characters intelligently and with a sense of humor that never condescends, outstanding production values, and even a score that never overwhelms nor tries to elicit emotional response that isn't otherwise deserved; what more can one ask? I haven't had this much fun since ""Spider-Man"" or ""Batman Begins,"" and I'll be back in the theater to see this one again, soon, if only to prep for ""The Incredible Hulk"" (in which Stark/Iron Man will apparently make at least a cameo appearance).Cynics may object to the de rigueur ""sci-fience"" that ""Iron Man"" relies upon to exist, but that doesn't make the film any less entertaining or worthy of seeing on the big screen. Don't miss it!","

"Iron Man","skoobydoo6789","23 April 2015","When Iron Man came out in 2008, I didn't know much about the character except that he was a Marvel comic book character created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. After watching the movie, I fell in love with Iron Man. He became one of my favorite comic book superheros along with Batman and the X-Men. The movie is the reason why I started collecting comic books and graphic novels. Iron Man 1 is an awesome start to what has become an amazing and well-loved franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Iron Man is a modern take on the origin story of Tony Stark and how he became Iron Man. Stark is the CEO of Stark Industries, a company that creates weapons which he inherited from his father, Howard Stark. Tony is a self-describe ""genius, playboy, billionaire, philanthropist."" While in Afghanistan, he is captured by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings who want him to build weapons for them to use. With the help of fellow prisoner, Yinsen, Stark creates a primitive suit of armor with some weapons and escapes. Because of his escape, Tony has a chance of heart and sets out to become a new hero called Iron Man.The movie does a brilliant job of keeping the audience entertained. It has a great cast. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect choice to play Tony Stark/Iron Man. He does such a good job that it's hard to separate the character from the actor. Iron Man has a great supporting cast like Jeff Bridges, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Terrance Howard. The movie has a great soundtrack, story-line, and special effects.Iron Man is one of the best superhero movies that I've seen in years. Everything about this movie is brilliant. It never gets old over time. Iron Man is starts the MCU with a bang. Definitely a comic book movie that everyone should watch.","

Robert Downey Jr. was a perfect choice for the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The Big Lebowski - Jeff Bridges - was a perfect villain. Gwyneth Paltrow was great even though I felt like she was trying to hard at some points. Then there was Terrence Howard, a good actor who isn't used enough.There has been some talk that Iron Man doesn't have enough action. I would not say that at all. Iron Man has quite a lot of action, it just also has a story and character development.The action, by the way, is very good.Definitely set itself up for a sequel...","

They fight. The story of Steve Jobs versus Bill Gates?; no, Tony Stark vs. Obadiah Stane or really Iron Man vs bald Jeff Bridges with facial hair cut in menacing way not like he had it in The Big Lebowski. Without short-changing the movie, that pretty much wraps up the plot and it doesn?t even take that much of Iron Man to dispense with Iron Man-wannabee. There was an attempt at building a morale to the story but I think it was something like weapons are bad and super-weapons are like?worse.? The real draw here is to see Robert Downey, jr. as a superhero. As daft as that concept sounded before I saw the film, Downey is Iron Man or rather Tony Stark: drunk, overindulged, immature and following in his father?s footsteps. As someone I discussed the movie with said: ?it takes a wealthy cocaine addled playboy to really capture a wealthy, alcoholic playboy?. Jeff Bridges is also not who you would think of as super-villain material but apparently he can play anything well. Seriously, when the last thing you say him in when he wasn?t believable? In short, this was an entertaining way to kill off two hours on a Friday night.","

Definitely recommend.Good: Robert Downey Jr does an absolutely phenomenal job as the star character and has left his mark on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When he leaves, he shall be missed greatly. Gwyneth Paltrow is pretty good as Pepper Potts as are Terrence Howard and Clark Gregg as Rhodes and Coulson respectively. Jeff Bridges is excellent as Obadiah Shane even if his character was pretty poor. The story itself was pretty good and well written and (along with Batman Begins) shows an origin story can be excellent. It is funny when it needed to be and one particular joke had me almost in tears. The action was great and looked bad-ass. I loved the ending and its rapid cut to black was a very good call. Special effects, cinematography and music were all pretty good. Bad: Despite a great performance, the villain himself was pretty weak and could be spotted from a mile off within seconds of meeting him. The finale had little build up and was just tacked in to make it qualify as an action movie. The final defeat of the villain was lazy and it would have been better with the first method.Best Part: Tony Stark's first proper outing as Iron ManMVP: Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man9/10","

"Iron Man","inkblot11","6 August 2008","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the head of a large firm that makes devastating weapons of warfare. His father, who founded the company, was responsible for the A-bomb, among other achievements, and he schooled his genius son in the ""fine"" art of making killing devices. Now, Stark has rock-star status in the world, for he is also very handsome and rich. On a trip to Afghanistan, with Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) as a guide, Stark shows the Allied Forces his newest creation. All of a sudden, the company is ambushed and Stark is taken prisoner. Once in captivity, a fellow scientist saves his life by implanting a mechanical device in his heart, for the shrapnel that remains in his body could kill him. Now, the Afghan meanies want Stark to re-create his latest weapons for them and give him any materials he requests, within reason. But, in his new laboratory-cave, Stark instead develops a unique bit of armor that can withstand almost any attack. Naturally, with this metallic suit, he breaks out of his prison and gets rescued, nevertheless leaving bits and pieces of the armor behind. Once back in Malibu, he informs the press that his company won't be making any more weapons. This angers his longtime co-worker, Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) and puzzles his ultra-efficient personal assistant, Pepper Potts (Gywneth Paltrow). In secret, Stark begins to work on a new suit of armor that will far surpass his original work. Thus, he becomes ""Iron Man"", a human with the ability to fly and take out the bad guys. Will he save the world? This is an excellent, excellent film, one of the best, if not the BEST, of 2008. First, the cast is terrific. Downey's great manic abilities are slightly in check but he delivers his lines with energy, humor, and compassion. As such, he is one of the most likable comic book heroes ever put up on the screen. Bridges, too, is a marvel, as he totally ""hides"" in his role as the supposed friend who crosses over into the dark side. He should most definitely receive an Oscar nomination for his work. As for Paltrow, she is beautiful, intelligent, wry, and touching, nicely balancing the mostly male cast with her strong showing. Howard is one great sidekick and the rest of the cast, although mostly unknowns, are very fine. One must mention that the costumes and sets are wonderful, too. As for the special effects, the script/story, and the direction, they are absolutely mind-blowing and will transfix almost any audience out there. In short, my advice is to go, and go now, to arrange a showing, for this is one of the best ""big-money"" movies ever made.","

"Iron Man","rauh-georg","15 September 2008","This is another ""run-off-the mill"" marvel/superhero movie without ANY new twists or any originality.The plot could have been written by a 6 year old.Take known elements off robocop, terminator, spiderman and mix it together to make a ""new"" movie where everything is ultra-predictable, except that those other known"" superheros like robocop or terminator are certainly better in their class while the iron man just excels in mediocrity.The main character has not enough charisma to be like-able by the audience, unlike a hero, say ""spiderman"" with its weaknesses and odd characteristics. The story line is simple and, excuse me, not logical or credible.The only good part of the movie was the special effects, mainly the scenes with the iron man flying...but there are other comparable movies where such things have been done better already.Of course...since we're dealing with a ""run-off-the-mill"" superhero movie...add the obligatory villain end fight...add some non-logical solution so our ""hero"" at the ends prevails (""just push the bypass button"")...villain dies....and everyone can go home happy after wasting two hours with this Luke-warm re-wash of things we've seen 100 times already.

"Iron Man","Puroo","9 May 2021","I had no interest in superhero movies until the release of Avengers: Infinity War. I had decided to watch all the MCU movies so that I could catch up before Endgame releases. This was the very first one in the list and also the very reason why I stuck on this franchise, because I knew that if the very first movie had so much to offer, I'd really be in for some good time with all these movies. And since this movie attempted to do something new (that I'll talk about later), Tony Stark already became my favourite MCU character.First of all, the acting in this movie is superb. I've heard people say that Robert Downey Jr's acting is quite mediocre, but here I felt as though it was terrific. He actually feels like he's the character. If he wanted he didn't have to do the finger snapping thing while waiting for Jarvis to download the data for the suit upgrades, he didn't have to sound nonchalant every time something great happened and he didn't even have to make those quirky one liners in every scene. But he still did all of that. And with just that personality combined with character development he managed to completely steal the show.Alongside the acting another thing that made this movie great is the idea. Until now we used to see superheroes to be like ""I have to keep my identity a secret UwU"". But this is finally the movie where the superhero comes in front of the press and says ""I'm Iron Man!"". Also the superheroes are shown to have very high morals who can never be wrong and inspire other people to be like them. You will never expect them to be self centred and care-free. Of course nowadays this is rapidly becoming an idea of showing superheroes to be morally corrupt, but this isn't what this movie is saying. It's just a man with a super suit who fights bad people entirely out of his own choice without any concern of what others say.The CGI and cinematography is another thing that makes this movie so great. If you just see the plot, what is there? A man gets attacked by terrorists, he builds a suit to save himself, he upgrades it and becomes the superhero, the bad guy who wants to take over the world finds out his old suit, hero-villain fight, hero wins, roll credits. Most of this was shown in the trailer itself. But what mainly carries it is the visual appeal and tone, something that MCU movies are still replicating (Captain Marvel smh). It is fun to see Iron Man just do something on the big screen. It's so visually satisfying to see him failing the designs and trying to fix them. Even the scene in which Stane pulls Iron Man's Arc Reactor was scary, but fun to watch.But of course this movie isn't without its fair share of flaws. For starters the movie seems to be taken way too lightly. Iron Man kills all those terrorists but faces no consequences. Iron Man flies among US Army but faces no consequences (sure he does reveal he's Iron Man in the end but before that it's very little). The movie also spends time showing Tony's life before and after being Iron Man that it just seems like padding the runtime, although the padding makes the movie somewhat comfortable to watch. Like I mentioned above, this movie severely lacks content. Pepper learning about Stane being the villain was also a very ""Oh no! Anyway..."" type reveal.Iron Man is a perfect origin story that is satisfying to watch and also something fun. It's a good thing that this is the first movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, since there are many movie franchises where the first movie itself is bad (The Fast and the Furious, Transformers, Fantastic Four, Mortal Kombat etc). I'm glad I made this decision. Back when I saw this movie, Iron Man had become my favourite superhero. I used to talk and act like Tony Stark, that's the impact it left on me.","

"Iron Man","immortal74205","30 April 2008","When I first heard that there was going to be an Iron Man movie, I was skeptical. Some of the recent origin story comic book movies have been mediocre at best. The Fantastic Four and Hulk are the first two that come to mind. Batman Begins, Spider-Man and Superman were a few of those rare treats where it was done well. Iron Man is one that is difficult to do because of all of the technology involved, not only in the Iron Man suit himself, but because of the fact that the story deals with state of the art technology developed by billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.).Director Jon Favreau hit this one out of the ballpark, making Iron Man an overnight sensation to those who were not familiar with him in the first place. This film is also the first movie to be released under the new Marvel Studios banner. Before, Marvel worked in concert with studios like Warner Bros. and Paramount to produce their properties, but this is the first to be solely made by Marvel, and then distributed by a major film studio, in Iron Man's case, Paramount Pictures.This is one of the first superhero comic book movies that I can think of where a well-known actor who is playing the title role, actually does a good job. Does anyone remember Daredevil, or dare I mention again, Hulk. Besides Downey playing the title character, Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the cast. Paltrow actually gives a decent performance as Stark's secretary Pepper Potts, and isn't too annoying like both Katie Holmes was in Batman Begins, and Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns. Howard plays Stark's best friend Jim Rhodes, a military officer who eventually finds out about Stark's 'new toy' and covers for him when his own fighters accidentally engage him, thinking he's an enemy bogey. Just from some of the events in the film, it appears evident that Howard might be back for the sequel, possibly dawning the second suit to become War Machine.Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's mentor and partner in Stark Industries. Not only was he a friend of his father, but he helped Stark build his empire by selling weapons to the U.S. military. Of course Stark doesn't know that someone has been selling his weapons to third world nations as well, to use against the U.S. military. It is partially because of this that Stark starts to build the Iron Man suit and help get his company's weapons back in the hands of the U.S.The battle between the large Mark I and the Mark III (red and yellow suit) is pretty good. It doesn't get dragged out too long and it keeps you entertained. The film has lots of elements of humor, all used in appropriate places. Most of them revolve around Stark's sarcastic attitude to his friends and his inventions (he talks to his machines in his lab).There are plenty of shock and awe fanboy moments as we see the armor for the first time on Mark I, and then the machine that puts the Mark III suit on Stark in his lab. It is probably one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Plus, be on the lookout for several agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. The ending is fantastic, with Stark saying probably the most anticipated line in the whole film, easily setting the stage for the eventual sequel.","

"Iron Man","bluesman-20","25 October 2008","Iron man great film. It is more faithful to the comic book that inspired it. Robert Downey JR is the film he hits the ground running from his first scene and never stops running, RDJ plays Tony Stark like a lazy Howard Hughes/James Bond wannabe with a little bit of Hugh Hefner tossed in. He does not lack confidence and he almost has a childlike naive way of looking at life. Until a life altering and threatening accident places him in the hands of terrorists who demand he create a weapon for them. Stark creates something but not for them he creates a Armor with enough weapon power to take out an army which he proceeds to do. once home he realizes that he must take account for his actions his company makes weapons of mass destruction he must make amends thus is born Iron man a avenger out to protect the world from those who terrorize and commit atrocities on a massive scale. Jeff Bridges is superb as Stane, Stark's partner who betrays him and creates the Iron Monger a suit more powerful then Iron man's. the battle scenes are breath taking and suspenseful This movie delivers on all cylinders and fulfills any Iron man fan they even play Black Sabbith's IRON MAN and you know the movie is going to be fun when it pokes fun of itself by playing it over and over again specially in the background. One thing I must admit is this . the director made a movie better then the comic from which it came. This movie is a family movie deep down in it's iron plated heart it delivers action some romance some development in the form of Tony Stark as he grows from a spoiled man who does not take any accountability whatsoever for his actions to a Iron Plated hero out to not only take responsibility for his actions but those of others as well. This movie left me wanting more Iron Man and hopefully soon.","

"Iron Man","Movie_Muse_Reviews","2 May 2008","It's time to suit up, because the comic film genre has a new face bringing it back to life and it's a shiny one. ""Iron Man"" delivers everything you want in a comic book-based film and is probably the best thing to happen to Marvel Studios since Spider-Man 2--that's nearly 4 years of a lot of money with disappointing delivery. A good start for the first film fully produced by the studio with no additional funding.Iron Man is not the most well-loved of Marvel characters, but at this point in the Marvel film universe, he feels like next logical step to give the comic company a boost in the right direction. The man is Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), a millionaire playboy in the arms dealing business. On a routine demonstration trip in Afghanistan (updated to the modern era), Stark is captured and held hostage by a rebel band of Afghanis who demand he build them one of his best missiles. Instead, Stark devises a plan to build a suit of armor so he can escape.A victim of the very weapons he created, Stark's uniqueness in comparison to other Marvel heroes Stan Lee has created is that he learns the error of his ways, his ignorance to the evil his industry produces, and the experience changes his perspective. It's not a vengeance story, it's one of personal redemption. Downey Jr. carries this film. Not entirely, but the film focuses more on his discovery and creation of Iron Man than it does on him being on Iron Man and fighting evil, a wonderful choice by the writers. Downey Jr.'s standard witty comedic acting fits this perfectly as finally there is a superhero with a sense of humor. ""Iron Man"" could be the funniest of all superhero films, or at least it certainly beats the awkward attempts of ""Spider-Man 3."" Marvel was way overdue for introducing a new character after the 3rd installments of the ""X- Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" franchises. An origin story, the reason why those other franchises took off, was in order. Those films were fantastic in many ways, but failed because they tried to do too much and ""Iron Man"" doesn't. The plot is straightforward. Now there have been other Marvel origin films ""Hulk"" and ""Daredevil"" for example, that fail as well. ""Iron Man"" is better than those films because it is so focused on Stark's character. This is interesting and fascinating because of the visual effects and the sheer creativity of those behind the concept of what his suit could actually do. A lot of scenes are test scenes and while not much is going on, they're really cool and captivating. There's no law that superheroes have to spend most of their time as the hero and fighting. ""Iron Man"" doesn't do that--it reserves that for the climax of the film and doesn't dwell there any longer than it must. You want more, but what you do get isn't bad.The supporting cast really helps too. Bridges in his first truly evil role as Stark's adviser turned-bad, Obadiah Stane, is great, Paltrow provides a nice change of pace as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts and even Terrence Howard is likable as Stark's friend and military ally, Jim Rhodes.The only thing to complain about ""Iron Man"" is that there wasn't enough. So much time, though rightly so, was spent on Stark's development of ""Iron Man"" that there wasn't enough room for more awesome action sequences in the suit and most disappointing of all, further thematic development, which is what made Spider-Man revolutionary. It's all there, but it doesn't get as much attention as it should. A second viewing might bring those themes home more.Jon Favreau should get incredible applause for outdoing the skepticism he unjustly received when it was first revealed he would be at the helm. There are plenty of treats for the comic book fans in this film and there's just a lot of great realism to this film than previous films too focused on great one-liners and the like, which is what someone like Favreau of the ""dude romantic comedy"" persuasion can bring to a genre in so much need of that normal/ human touch.","

"Iron Man","policy134","10 May 2008","How many superheroes can filmmakers drain to absolute dehydrated shells? Look what happened to the Superman movies (5 so far counting the most recent waste of time) and the Batman movies (Also 5, if you don't count the recently yet un-released swan song of Heath Ledger). Actually, Batman was reinvigorated with a new innovative director, superb story and brilliant actors who saw its potential.The same could be said for this the latest installment of what could have been a massive bore. The director, Jon Favreau, who is also an actor, had the stroke of genius to cast Robert Downey, Jr. in the part of zillionaire tycoon, Tony Stark. Downey, while not playing himself, clearly put some autobiographical stamp on his part which fit the character brilliantly. Tony Stark is a middle aged man who seizes the chance to redeem himself after a frightening wake up call (cue Downey's sordid past). Favreau also cast Gwyneth Paltrow and for once her character didn't make me want to spew vile as other female characters have done in lesser superhero flicks (eg. Uma Thurman in Batman bomb + Robin). One minor quibble, her character must be the loneliest person on earth besides Stark himself. No clear motivation as how she is attracted to him other than that.Jeff Bridges acquits himself nicely, although it is never explained how he is able to be a threat to Iron Man (see the climactic battle if you don't know what I mean). Also his mumbling performance is a bit tiresome after a while.The CGI is of course top-notch and quite unbelievable (really, where can you get such a supercomputer, let me know). There is a clever little sequence while Stark is perfecting his suit that mirrors a scene seen in Disclosure. As for the action sequences they are not that interesting, except for a glorious dogfighting sequence.So I was only mildly interested in seeing it but once it was over I thought: ""It could have been better but not the mind blowing bore I thought it was going to be"".","

"Iron Man","faded-77380","19 January 2022","Tony Stark is our man to the core. Just think, a multimillionaire and a brilliant inventor - there are a dime a dozen such heroes today. No, the main thing is that he is a womanizer and a drinker. In addition, he is absolutely not tormented by remorse about the means of mass destruction produced by his company.More precisely, it was so until Tony was captured by the evil dushmans, where he saw that his weapons, created to arm the American army, were being used very much against it. Fortunately, the bad Afghans underestimated the genius of our hero and allowed him to quietly assemble armored robotic armor of the MARK-1 type, thanks to which he showed the brats the uniform of Kuzkin's mother. That's how Iron Man appeared.And you can love him already at least for the fact that he is, in fact, to blame for the emergence of his superhero essence. No one killed his relatives, no mutated arthropods bit him either. He became what he became by reaping the fruits of his labors. Well, I just wanted to live, of course.The main success of the film adaptation was, of course, Robert Downey Jr. In the title role. It is clear why the role sits on him like a cast - the actor played almost himself, because in his youth he had a long pernicious affair with alcohol and drugs, but eventually broke himself and went on the right path. Recently, you can see more and more works of this magnificent actor; Tony Stark, of course, is not the best, but definitely one of them.Gwyneth Paltrow plays furniture. Drop the snide grins, and think about it properly: the Oscar winner plays furniture. They say she agreed solely because of the opportunity to work with Downey Jr. And, it should be noted, Pepper Potts in her performance is simply charming at times. Such an assistant is the cherished dream of many men, undoubtedly.You can also add a good script to the asset of the tape, evenly placing accents on different components of the story and not focusing on one thing. The energetic direction of Jon Favreau, which allowed you to never get bored for two hours. And, especially, a dashing soundtrack to match the whole action. It's a pity that ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" from the Filter team did not migrate from the teaser to the final version, but earlier I would not have been able to believe in the existence of a big-budget Hollywood movie in our time that would start with AC/DC and end with Black Sabbath.And about the effects, or what... and what kind of blockbuster is this - and without special effects? For the most part, everything is fine with them, but when Iron throws people in different directions, flying bodies with their unnatural animation give out the computer essence of themselves. But really something, and the suit itself came out just for a sight.And what do we have in the end? This movie doesn't have a maniacally reflective protagonist. And there is no throwaway pathos either. The main villain does not seem to have the idea of fixing the enslavement of humanity, and his opponent, in principle, does not keep in mind the desire to save the world from another universal evil. Everyone has their own small local tasks.That's why the film is very lightweight, it does not load the viewer's brains beyond measure, it is almost perfectly balanced. He, the Christmas trees are green, is just interesting in all its aspects. Yes, the movie came out a little loose, all its components seem to stick together, but if you remove, for example, humor, everything will instantly fall apart. However, this is exactly what makes the ""Iron Man"" a kind of charming dolt, spitting on generally accepted norms, but immediately endearing the viewer to himself.","

"Iron Man","Chris Knipp","15 May 2008","Is this story supposed to have political significance? In it Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the brilliant playboy scion of a megabucks American weapons manufacturer (are there cut-rate ones?), discovers that his company's products, which he ostensibly thought used to protect the US and preserve ""peace,"" are being supplied to some multinational bad guys in Afghanistan. To keep us guessing about who's being demonized this time, these blokes speak Egyptian Arabic, Dari, Pushtu, Hungarian, and after that I lost track. You wonder how they carry out their operations since they change languages every five minutes. Naturally their leader turns out to speak perfect English so he can spar verbally with Tony as the need arises.While Mr. Stark is held prisoner with a friendly foreign scientist, he's supposed to develop a super-rocket so the bad guys can take over the whole region if not the world, but miraculously he manages to conceal the fact that he's in fact not doing that at all but engineering a spectacular escape by cobbling together a giant robotic weapons-fitted iron suit out of scraps. That'll show them.Oh and by the way, Stark's chest got filled with shrapnel when the baddies captured him, so he's fitted first with a giant magnet to keep the lethal metal from going to his heart, and then some sort of artificial heart gadget. It's supposed to be a wonder but we're not to know how it works. All we know is that it gives out a luminous glow. It's the symbol that Tony himself, hitherto into life only for the pleasure it could give him, has acquired an ability to care. He rushes home, flying through the air being one of his suit's abilities, and after declaring his Stark Weapons Technologies out of the weapons business, begins devising a much more high tech and sleek version of the robotic suit thing, in red, and no longer made of iron but some sorts of miraculous alloys.There is a little of James Bond in Tony Stark. He likes to drink, he likes women, and frankly, up to now, he doesn't give a damn. On top of that he has wavy hair, a sharp mustache, a nice tan, and a fearsome intellect. His repartee is rapid fire and offhand and only occasionally mimics the delivery of Kevin Spacey. Remember Bond's blazing Astin Martin? This robotic suit thingy is some sort of grossly hypertrophied offshoot.There are two kinds of real fun in Iron Man for those who are patient enough to sit through all the wizard explosions and pointless political confusion. One is the dazzling special effects of Tony's private robot suit factory (he shares his process only with tool-manipulating robots that he handles with witty condescension). This stuff becomes most entertaining when Tony learns how to fly, with some nasty bumps along the way; but for gadget geeks the elegant complexity of the artificial limbs and head and the way they click miraculously onto Tony are equally pleasurable. The other fun thing is to see Bridges and Downey Jr. and Paltrow play off each other. Yes, real people can be fun in a movie too.It ought to be inexorably comic, since the concept of the robot suit donned by a man is such a literal expression of Bergson's definition of comedy--""the mechanical encrusted upon the living."" Only it isn't. Nor are obvious, perhaps much too obvious, implications about technology shielding man from his humanity, ever brought to light in this movie.Well, yet another comic book has been brought to multi-million-dollar screen life in Hollywood. Favreau has assembled an excellent cast and one stops wondering why they bother (for the money, yes?) when one sees how typically mercurial and witty Robert Downey Jr. is in the lead, how disconcertingly unpleasant Jeff Bridges becomes as Obadiah Stone, his would-be nemesis, and how appealing and present Gywneth Paltrow is in the neutral role of Tony Dare's (Downey's) girl Friday, Pepper Potts (cute name). Terrence Howard is wasted and too mild as some kind of air force commander who basically just works for the weapons company.You might wonder why Iron Man has done so well with adult film critics. Isn't this just adolescent fare given a mild gloss of adulthood and a heavy extra coat of S/X? But then you think of how much better this is than the competition, and you understand.","

"Iron Man","kaden_lewis","10 June 2021","This is it, the one that started it all, the entire MCU. This a a great movie to do so. It had a great story which nailed the origin of Tony Stark becoming Iron Man, and it had a great plot in general. I thought the casting was perfect, Robert Downey Jr. Is perfect to play Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper Potts. I also thought Jeff Bridges played a great Obadiah Stain, and Terrence Howard played James Rhodes pretty well. I am however happy Don Cheadle took over, I think he is a much better Rhodes.All in all, this movie is the perfect start to one of the best movie franchises of all time.","

"Iron Man","Ltufano23","2 January 2024","After seeing the success of their other superheroes on the big screen, Marvel Comics brings one of their original Avengers to the screen with Iron Man. Being relatively unknown to the wider masses at the time, the film tells the origins of billionaire Tony Stark donning the Iron Man suits. While the superhero origin movie has felt overplayed in the last few years, Iron Man still holds up a higher quality and feels truly well thought out in a way that has been lacking lately. Reviving his career, Robert Downey Jr. Fully encapsulates the character of Tony Stark and creates a figure that easily became a household name from his mix of charisma and heart. With visual effects that are unbelievably realistic, every action scene acts as a compliment to the captivating story and delightful acting. This film was lightning in a bottle at the perfect time, allowing an entire universe to be born out of it, while having fans invest deeply into it. Changing the future of superhero films forever, Iron Man introduced audiences to something truly special with a legacy that will not soon be forgotten.","

"Iron Man","filmbuff-05706","11 July 2020","Note: I am going to start with a lengthy introduction about my relationship with superhero movies. It is necessary for me to do this to properly give my thoughts on Iron Man. Please bear with me, thanks.I am 21 years old, a life-long film buff, and I once actually took the time to find out that I have seen over 1,125 movies. With this kind of enthusiasm for film, it may shock you that I saw Iron Man for the first time just last night. In fact, it's the 2nd movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I have seen-the first being Spider Man: Homecoming.You see, Iron Man came out on May 2nd, 2008. I was 9 at the time. There were very few superhero movies that really engaged me then. I can think of Tim Burton's Batman and Spider Man with Tobey Maguire, and I think the line ends there. The genre never really appealed to me, and just a few years ago I started gradually gaining a love for superhero flicks.When Avengers: Endgame released, my youth group was going to see it but I stayed behind when I realized how far behind I was in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like I said, I had only seen Spider Man Homecoming.Back in December, just a few days before Christmas, I bought the first 2 movies- Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. But even though I was gradually getting into superhero movies, I was struggling to get myself to sit down and watch Iron Man. I kept making excuses- I don't want to right now. I'll watch this movie instead. What if it falls into the weaker superhero movie category?I finally sat down last night and watched the movie. I laid on the couch, opened my mind....and turned on the subtitles. I notice with a lot of movies that the characters talk too softly and I need subtitles to get the dialouge, so I put that aside and focused on the movie.The plot follows Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.), a billonare weapon inventor who is kidnapped to build weapons for some terriosts. Instead, he builds a man made of metal and uses it to escape. He uses this invention afterwards for good, and then he needs it to fight Obadiah Stane(Jeff Brifdges), who doesn't like Stark's change of heart.The first positive thing I noticed about Iron Man was the cinematography. Iron Man is one of the most polished looking movies I've ever laid eyes on- it's bright, colorful, and even though it's 12 years old, it looks like it was made today.Iron Man contains some really nice and intense action, such as when Iron Man and Obadiah duke it out in the final act. Wherever Iron Man is in action, it's quite stunning to look at.There are also some comic relief moments that work well. The main example I can come up with is when Tony is testing his suit and it malfunctions in multiple amusing ways. Another was my favorite scene in the movie, where Pepper, Tony's assistant, helps him repair his heart's electromagnet. I won't explain that any further to avoid spoilers.When it comes to acting and other elements, Iron Man usually succeeds. However, there are a few flaws that make it a 9 and not a 10. I already mentioned that I found the dialouge to be quite soft, but I've seen 10s that have that problem, that's more a personal thing than an actual flaw.My biggest problem is a flaw I have with most superhero movies, even good ones. Here's the problem- the opening runs too long and the hero is more compelling than the man occupying it. The best superhero movies(Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight particularly) tell a deep story that makes us care about the hero as much as the man. In Iron Man, while Tony Stark is a compelling character, the movie was more engaging when he was in his red and yellow suit, which, by the way, happens in the middle of the movie.Also, like I said, Tony is kidnapped by terriosts. This takes up roughly a half hour of the movie, and while it is essential to the plot, it could have been cut down maybe 10-15 minutes at least. It runs too long and it made me anxious for the plot to drag less. However, the more the plot unfolds, the better the pacing gets.Iron Man also has many minor pleasures throughout for Marvel fans. Early in the movie, we see a cameo of Stan Lee at a party for Tony, so see if you can spot him! Near the end, Terence Howard's character alludes near the end that he will join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though this was changed to Don Cheadle.And, like all the movies, after all of the credits roll, there is a post-credits scene that teases future movies. This one gives a cameo with Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. I must confess that I took out the DVD after the cast credits, forgetting to watch that part, but I re-inserted the DVD just to see that 45 second clip. If you watch a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, don't forget to stay after the credits!A personal pleasure for me were the Biblical allusions. While they don't advance the story or anything, I smirked when Tony donates some money to a man dressed as Caesar, and quotes Matthew 22:21, saying: ""Render therefore unto Caesar what is Caesar's!"" There are references like this that I admired. Also, I don't know if this was planned, but the villain shares a name with an Old Testament prophet.So while I don't think Iron Man is a perfect movie, I do have a deep admiration for it. In fact, if I made a top 10 list of the superhero movies I have seen, Iron Man would probably make that list. As an introduction to the biggest franchise in Hollywood history, it's a decent start. I look forward to seeing more MCU movies and catching up with all the hype. Iron Man is a bright look into the cinematic future.","

"Iron Man","desert-jackets","14 September 2013","This amazing and mostly a kind of realistic movie is set by the plot in the way to keep you involved from beginning to the end. The most fascinating part that blew my mind off was the extraordinary special-effect. Don't be uncertain, this Iron Man is an entirely wonderful movie. I won't write any spoilers ti its reviews and would urge to watch this movie possibly if you still haven't watched it. Marvel must have made these types of movies long ago.As the name of Robert Downey is not amongst the biggest names in the Hollywood, he still played his role flawlessly and intimidated me how he represented Iron Man so greatly. Also the humor worked well in this movie. The script is perfect and it carries the wonderful cast.I was largely impressed by the CGI. They were magnificent and are not disturbing to make you miss great scenes of this movie. It is not possible to forget that this is an Action movie, so it's not that just the stars have to be congratulated; each individual effect was also fairly wonderful. The fighter jet scenes seemed very lame in Iron Man's trailer, but when I watched the full movie, it satisfied my expectations.This amazing full of special-effects Iron Man film has to offer you a thrilling ride particularly when it comes to the battle part. And no doubt, the credit for uplifting its ranking goes to Robert Downey who once an unknown character now a familiar personality. I like the technology of Iron Man which has the quality to avoid targeting people.The second half is full of pure action. The well-written script and enough twist-scenes are well delivered to keep you tighten with your seat till the end. This remarkable movie pleased everybody succeeded greatly. The whole 2.5 hours playing of this movie offers you latest action hero for the CGA sated appreciation. The best use of the amazing leather jackets has been made in this movie, especially by Robert Downy as Tony Stark in this movie. Until now, I was wondering if I could find one of those hangar scene leather jackets outside the Stark industry. Finally, I have found the solution to all my Hollywood style leather jackets needs. Desert leather is the wonderful online website that offers all Hollywood celebrity style genuine leather jackets at an attractive price with free shipping all across the USA. They are the exact replica of the leather jackets worn by the famous celebrities like the one in this super-hit Iron Man.Tony Stark also made the weapons for war, so when he goes to Afghanistan, he introduced a new missile for the terrorists. He finally got to know that the weapons were not in the right hands so he created metal suit and became Iron Man and shut down the Stark Industry when he saw all the violence. Ultimately Iron Man set the record of success for the comic book movies and finally went beyond this summer season. In its wrap up, I would say that Iron Man will make publicity and my outlook is great as a comic book reader.","

"Iron Man","rparham","5 July 2008","If there is one thing that makes Iron Man a cut above many comic book movies, and on par with such entries as Batman Begins and Superman Returns, it is it's reliance on character and the actions that occur because of decisions that emanate from them, and not the machinations of plot. Iron Man is a story about it's central character, Tony Stark, and he is carried well by performer Robert Downey, Jr.Iron Man opens in Afghanistan, where Stark, millionaire weapons developer, is showing off his latest product for the military. The convoy he is riding in is attacked, and Stark is captured by rebels, who demand he build them a version of his new weapon. Stark instead uses the parts and tools to fashion a suit of armor to help him escape, and keep him alive by preventing some shrapnel lodged in his chest from entering his heart.After Stark manages to escape from his captors, he returns to home, and announces to the world that his company will stop weapons production, which doesn't go over well with his board or directors, or his longtime partner and friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). While the political machinations are going down, Stark is busy tinkering with his armor design to get it perfected, and when he sees the atrocities going on around the world, often using weapons from his company, he decides to use the armor to act.At the plot level, Iron Man is nothing tremendously special. It follows a typical superhero origin story, letting us see how the superhero came into being, the early testing of powers, etc. In that respect, Iron Man is nothing to write home about. However, given that framework, director John Favreau and screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway use it to build the story around the cataclysmic change that sends Tony Stark from being a millionarie playboy who spouts platitudes about how weapons protect the US to a man awakened to the bitter realities that surround him that he had previously shut out.What helps sell Tony Stark is the strong performance of Robert Downey, Jr. Downey, in concert with the script, makes Tony Stark less of your typical superhero and more of an average, if someone eccentric, guy. Yes, Stark is a genius, and has a quirky personality, but he still manages to seem a bit like someone you know and like spending time with. Downey's exceptional dialogue delivery, paired with his devil may care attitude, makes Tony Stark a memorable comic book hero.Iron Man imbues it's secondary characters, even the minor ones, with enough development for us to care about what happens to them, so that when the action sequences occur, we have an rooting interest in the outcome, making them more than just random pyrotechnics. Favreau and company don't accomplish the best action sequences in modern comic book action film-making, but they work well enough to be entertaining.Most of the other performances are up to par, with Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's right hand woman, Pepper Potts, who has a somewhat unrequited interest in Stark. Jeff Bridges portrays Obadiah Stane with both a seemingly well-intentioned interest in Stark's success, but also a just under the surface sense of menace. Terrence Howard fills the role of reliable associate with good aplomb as Rhodey, Stark's longtime military friend.What Iron Man proves, and other filmmakers toiling in the comic book world would do well to take notice of, is that when you bring the focus of your story in on the people at the heart of it, and match them with good actors, the results can be exceptional. We can only hope Iron Man is the continuation of a trend that keeps growing.","

"Iron Man","Matt_Layden","6 May 2008","Tony Stark is a wealthy weapons manufacturer on a routine trip back from a demonstration of his latest weapon, when he is attacked by rebels who want him to build his latest weapon for their own evil gain. Taking shrapnel to the chest, he must have a pacemaker like device on at all times in order to live. After escaping his captives, Stark sees a new side to life and wants to protect the people who have died from his weapons. Thus creating Iron Man.I've read a few issues of Iron Man, enough to know what the story is about, who the characters are and what to expect from the film. I never went in with high expectations, wanting it to be the best thing since sliced bread, and I left the theatre with a smile on my face. Iron Man is the firs real summer blockbuster movie to grace the screen in a long time. Filled with humorous dialogue, great casting and high flying special effects, Iron Man is one of the best comic book adaptations ever put to film.With the announcement of Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark, I knew John Favreau was the right man for the job. Downey has shined a light on himself so bright that I expect more leading roles to come his way. With perfect comedic timing and a dramatic arc to boot, he has created one of the most compelling comic book characters on film to date. With Peter Parker we are beaten over the head with his love for Mary Jane and his guilt for his uncle, we never really get pass this. X-men has too many characters to keep track of for us to emotionally connect to one central character. Iron Man manages to make a womanizing, alcoholic, weapons manufacturer actually likable. All of that is because of Downey's charisma. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much to do here, but she makes the material work. Howard was a little off his game. His presence wasn't there. It seemed like he wasn't confident enough in this role and it was really out of place. Jeff Bridges is menacing in the looks, but comedic in the dialogue. I don't know if it is my hours upon hours of Lebowski watching, but I just did not find Bridges voice to be menacing at all. I kept hearing the dude. He wasn't threatening enough.Iron Man sets itself apart from other comic book films (except for Batman Begins) with how serious it is. The film prides itself on being more realistic then what one would think. This is accomplished by focusing more on the man inside the armor then the high flying rocket shooting, breaking sound barrier hot rod red ""superhero"". This is because Iron Man is simply that....a man. He has no special powers, no enhanced ability. He has loads and loads of money.The problem with most origin stories is that it has to set everything up. It doesn't have the time to have fun with the story and make it seem really dangerous to the characters. Iron Man has a lot of set up and little delivery on the action. There are two scenes in which Stark throws on the suit and does actual battle. Not including the cave made promo device. This has pros and cons, it does make the film seem more plausible. I believed a lot of what was happening, until the final fight scene. Unfortunately, that final fight scene doesn't knock anyone's socks off. It doesn't blow our minds, it's too generic and the suit, environments and weaponry were not used to their full potential.The special effects are well done, nothing too jaw dropping. It seemed like the crew knew what they had to do and just went for that. Nothing seems to be trying to grab our attention, it all fits naturally. Some scenes are bit off and noticeable CGI is used, which may be distracting to the eye. Specially when Downey is sitting in front of the TV and he has the armor suits arm on his right arm.I'm impressed with Favreau. I wasn't a big fan of Elf and Zathura was garbage. With Iron Man Favreau has found his calling. I hope he doesn't try anymore kid films and sticks to what he knows and does best. He never let the content get away from him, considering it is so huge and upon first glance, would seem out of his league.Iron Man is a fun ride that kicks off the summer blockbuster trend. While it is not as good as X-Men 2 or some other comic book outings, it is indeed one of the strongest ones. With the inevitable sequel, we will get to see what Iron Man can really do.","

Any worries I had about this film went right out the window, and they'll stay out the window when I go again... and again... and again.

"Iron Man","mediapeertime","17 July 2013","As a kid I loved superhero movies. As an adult, I do too. It's really the story that drives any movie to me. So a superhero movie that is just all special effects and action really does nothing for me. Iron Man, like the original Superman and the Tobey McGuire Spiderman has a great story. Tony Stark, played in avery likable way by Robert Downey, Jr, is somewhat of an egotistical, rich kid with a great mind, but he is endearing, even from the beginning of the movie. You can tell he has aheart, but flaws like any person. After he is captured by villainous terrorists, it's exactly his heart (or damage to it) that allows him to create a mechanical suit that turns him into a superhero. So he's not a superhero, at least in his physicality, like Superman. his great mind and circumstances of his life allow him to turn himself into a superhero.Gwyneth Paltrow is superb in this film, and ""love"" story between her and Downey (Iron Man) is intesne, and so felt, though they never get together (I guess like every real superherp movie, you really are pulling for them to make out). Also, Jeff Bridges was great in the film, as usual. Fine directing by Swingers creator, Jon Favreau.One point: as good as Downey was, I'd rather have seen someone else in the role. Really, a junkie playing a superhero? Sorry, it just doesn't fit right.Ending the movie with Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" was just awesome!","

"Iron Man","Filmdokter","13 May 2021","#MCUrewatch. It was a brave choice to kick-off the MCU with Iron Man and not First Avenger Captain America. But it was the right choice because it's the performance of Downey Jr. As Tony Stark that makes this such a highly entertaining (and still one of the best) films in the franchise. The actor is helped by a strong script with a straightforward story and brilliant dialogues. Top that off with solid action, great score and a fine performance of Paltrow. The character of baddie Obediah is pretty one dimensional but it's the assure attitude of Bridges (and a great bald head and beard) that elevates this above the average MCU bad guy. The best thing is that in this MCU rewatch you notice already some Stark character elements that are payed off quite a few films into the franchise. He already despises the lack of control over violence (which returns in Civil War) and his ""I am Iron Man"" confession returns later in a rather dramatic way.","

"Iron Man","Rob_Taylor","23 September 2008","All I can say is, give this one a chance. The movie moves along at a fine rate, there is action aplenty and it doesn't insult your intelligence particularly badly.Robert Downey Jr is excellent in the role of the socially mal-adapted Tony Stark whose world is turned upside down when he gets captured by ""evil terrorists (tm)"". He realises the error of his ways and sets out to change the world.In short, the movie develops Stark's character and lets you see how he becomes who he is. The technology on display is quite far-fetched, but it serves to further the story, not dominate it, or be used as a ""get out of trouble"" card by the hero.Comparing this to the year's other big superhero movie, The Dark Knight, there is really no viable comparison. Iron Man is leagues better in terms of coherent story, pacing and acting. Additionally, the movie leaves you wanting more, unlike TDK which drags on endlessly.In short, if you want a decent action hero movie, you could do far worse than see Iron Man. It's also nice to see the little cameo at the end that hints at future cooperation between the different superhero franchises.Well worth watching.","

Iron ManYes, the suit is impressive, a self-contained rocket launcher cum flying machine, but still earthly enough to show some marks from bullets.The opening sequence of Iron Man sets the stage for the film's ironic view of the arms world: Stark rides in a Humvee in Afghanistan only to be wounded by enemy fire generated by his own company. His subsequent incarceration in a cave, culminating in creating the iron outfit not only sets up the rest of his days as super hero but also profoundly changes the way he looks at armament as deterrent.As Stark is played by the mercurial Downey, the sardonic attitude is only a verbal spar away. Downey's checkered life of drugs and irresponsibility helps infuse Stark with the humanity and vulnerability that make him a hero we all can identify with.Superior characterization, effects, enjoyment.","

"Iron Man","edellks","12 June 2014","This is one movie I enjoy watching multiple times. Personally, I think it's the best of the three, and marginally better than The Avengers. It has a really strong sense of cohesion and grittiness throughout the movie which really draws the viewer in. They really do a good job of making you love and hate Tony Stark, all at the same time. The special effects are awesome, especially on Blu-Ray.Iron Man 2 was pretty good, 3 was rubbish (in my opinion.) Before you watch this, make sure you have your snacks and drinks ready because you won't want to get up and leave during any piece of this movie.","

"Iron Man","kylereddy-85699","27 March 2021","After rewatching This movie for what felt like the millionth time, I thoroughly enjoyed it even more than the last time I watched it. Iron Man is an instant classic and helped pave the way for many other amazing MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movies to come later. If you haven't seen this movie and enjoy superhero movies seriously just watch it. The plot is fantastic and extremely interesting. Everything just feels right at home. The casting gets it just right especially with Robert Downey JR as Iron Man and Gywneth Paltrow as Pepper. I can imagine no two people to play the roles better. This movie is a blast even after 13 years!","

"Iron Man","RikerDonegal","1 May 2008","After Superman, I believed that a man could fly. Now I believe that a man can redeem himself, no matter how badly he's fraked up in the past.And I could not be happier that they choose Robert Downey Jr. to carry this message. It works because it's his story, and it shows that he knows this. His heart is in every frame of this movie, his heart is in every word he utters, and your heart will be in the movie, too.It's a cool movie, with lots of things blowing up and stuff like that. But, it's a well-told human story first and foremost. If the X-Men movies strike a chord, it's because each one of us have known the pains of isolation and exclusion. If the Spider-Man movies strike a chord, it's because we all know the little fears and frustrations that drive our daily lives. And Iron Man? Iron Man is aimed at those of us who have made mistakes in the past and want to redeem ourselves.And, it strikes a chord. Believe me, it strikes a chord.

"Iron Man","joshrortiz","2 June 2013","An Iron Man movie? I was worried! How could they make this work? Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark? Jeff ""the dude"" bridges as the villain? I couldn't wait to see how this turned out! When I left the theater, I was so thrilled! A new superhero movie to watch over and over again. Robert Downey, Jr. was perfect casting. So darn witty, funny, charming, smart, cocky, vulnerable, fun, tough. He did a great job in the dramatic moments and brought the laughs in the lighter moments. There is a real change in the character throughout the movie. Gwenyth Paltrow is beautiful and her Pepper Potts is wonderful. The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is fantastic. Terrence Howard does a good job playing Colonel Rhodes. You can tell Rhodes and Stark are best pals. There's a nice little tease here dealing with Rhodes character and an Iron Man suit. Jeff Bridges as the villain? So great! One of my favorite actors for sure! Paul Bettany as the A.I. (good choice) Jarvis? Another genius idea.Jon Favreau did a wonderful job with this movie. He actually managed to pull this off, making The Avengers movie possible. Iron Man is a total blast! Favreau trusts his actors to really give their all, keeps the pace up, and the tone light. He even gets to play a role in the film, nice one Jon! There are so many great moments: watching Tony Stark escape in the Mark I, building his signature suit, saving people's lives, battling Iron Monger, every scene with Tony and Pepper! The special effects in this film are amazing. The final fight between Iron Man and Stane was not on par with the rest of the movie though. Maybe not epic enough, too short? Iron Man flies by. It's a great time! Action packed, funny, great special effects, great performances especially Robert Downey, Jr. And that ending- ""I AM Iron Man."" Woah!","

"Iron Man","meissotruey","18 November 2019","Good writing, good action, excellent cast, nice epic, probably the most charming villain among the all comic book movies. That's a pity that the actor who plays Rhodey, Terrence Howard, was replaced, he looked much more natural in this role than Don Cheadle, just as always money decides everything. Marvel & RDJ should be ashamed of their decision. Probably the best Marvel Movie, far better than the Avengers, this movie has much more of it's own originality, charm.","

"Iron Man","Quebec_Dragon","14 August 2009","This is the first actual movie made by Marvel comics's own studio instead of having their characters ""leased"" to another movie studio. They hit this one out of the park. The script is smart but what made Iron Man such a critical and financial success beyond the special effects is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. I just cannot imagine someone who could be more suave, funny and perfect as a genius playboy millionaire tech geek (yes, he beats whatsisname as Bruce Wayne handily). It's like having an Oscar-calibre actor in a popcorn superhero movie. We actually have three with Gwynneth Paltrow and the underrated Jeff Bridges. Tony Stark seems excited about creating and trying his Iron Man armour and it transmits to the audience. I remember thinking when I first saw Iron Man that despite Stark's genius, he could also be a jerk and irresponsible hothead but it's to Robert Downey's Jr and the writer's credits that you like Stark anyway.There's a genuine sense of fun permeating the whole film yet it's not without its serious dramatic moments. Everything would crumble if the superhero armour wasn't up to snuff but the different versions look amazing and believable, with lots of little incidental animation making it more dynamic. Sometimes you might think it's computer generated (and honestly it probably is most of the time) but it's easy to suspend your disbelief especially with the constant but cool close-up shots of Tony Stark inside the helmet with those constantly updating computer readings. That clever trick permits us to see the emotions that are not outwardly visible from the outside. Iron Man doesn't reinvent the superhero movie genre like Watchmen does but it does everything right while adding a few bits of originality such as the initially egotistical selfish almost villainous protagonist who changes as well as the guy becoming super-powered not through accident or mutation but by designing the coolest armours ever seen on screen. Let's not forget that clever never seen before ending who put a big smile on my face and probably most people who watched it in theatres the first time.Rating: 8 out of 10","

"Iron Man","plopmasterj","5 May 2008","I went to see Iron Man on Saturday afternoon. I truly believe that this is one of the best superhero movies ever! It certainly is an improvement over some of the other comic book movies to come out of Marvel's lineup, like the disappointing Spider-Man 3.Robert Downey Jr. makes one of the greatest performances ever as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is hysterical and is the best part of the whole movie. It's almost non-stop laughter with him, except of course when he is in danger and when he gets into fights with the bad guys. The rest of the cast is also very good. Jeff Bridges is amazing as the villain of the movie Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger. The character is wicked, and Daniels does a great job at playing the role. Terrence Howard is good as Jim Rhodes, while Gwyneth Paltrow proves to be a good love interest for Downey Jr. as Stark's assistant Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts.The special effects are incredible and the action is fun and awesome. Sometimes I couldn't tell when the suit was real or not. The comedy is very good, way better than I expected it to be. I do agree with critics who are saying that the one thing to complain about is the length of the movie: WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE IT LONGER!? Hopefully Jon Favreau will release an extended edition when the theatrical cut comes out on DVD or shortly after that.Great job Jon Favreau! You proved yourself to be a great director when it comes to comic book movies. Do another one! 9/10","

"Iron Man","Angelus2","2 July 2008","I've grown up watching the 90's Marvel cartoons, my favourite were of course, X-MEN, Spiderman and Ironman. When I first heard of this character being turned into a live action movie I had huge expectations and then saw the trailer. I was captured.The track Ironman by Black Sabbath is perfect, especially the 'I am Ironnnn-Mann!'; at first I thought that this would be like Batman Begins the characters are roughly the same, not the exact same....but both millionaires and create their own suits. The plot is based on the comics, Tony is a weapons manufacturer who is captured in Afganistan (Contemporised); by terrorist who want him to build a weapon and instead he uses this time to create the Mark 1. After escaping Tony has a epiphany and has a change of heart, stopping his company from making weapons; this causes tensions with partner Stane, who plots to bring Tony down by creating a suit known as the Iron Monger, although his name is never mentioned.I never expected Iron-Man to be a comedy and thats what caught me off guard. Comedy suits Iron Man...and so does Robert Downey Jr, Downey is Tony Stark, he gives off a brilliant performance as a fun loving bachelor and brings the hidden depths of the character to light when he realises his wrongs. Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet as Pepper Potts, while Jeff Bridges plays the conniving Stane; Rhodey is played by Terrence Howard who plays the concerning friend and ally of Stark with prominence and I have high hopes of seeing him as War Machine. Its great to see well established actors taking on these roles and making it more interesting and full of depth...The Iron Man suit is spectacular to look at and the second fight scene is satisfactory while the end fight scene with Iron Monger could have been a little better, but this is a origin story and succeeds in telling the origin of Iron Man, the S.H.E.I.L.D touch was perfect at the end.A childhood hero has been given justice...","

"Iron Man","joebloggscity","4 May 2008","No need to explain who Iron Man is (I hope!), i.e. that guy in the iron suit (surprise surprise) who used to pop up in Spiderman and Marvel cartoons etc when we were all younger. Anyhow away from the comic books, they've now made a film for the character, and takes Robert Downey Junior as Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) to fight the good fight for truth justice and all the rest.Basic story is that its ""Iron Man Begins"" like as was with ""Batman Begins"" and takes us through the origins of the character etc. Mix in explosions, mega robot v robot fight and all the rest, and surprisingly a lot of good humour and you have here a surprisingly good film. I never expected to enjoy this much but this is well worth it. Even Gwenyth Paltrow was well-suited, whilst Jeff Bridges was good as always.A big plus word for the visual effects, which were very good and fitted in well into the movie, and didn't overtake the whole film as it could have, getting the balance right.Recommended viewing. Not as great as Batman Begins, but you'll still enjoy it a lot.","

"Iron Man","joenasc","20 April 2015","After being captured by terrorists, billionaire Tony Stark creates a high tech suit of armor to escape and return home. Once home, he decides to make another suit, but more improved and uses it to fight terrorists and other evil.As I've said on a previous review, I've never read the DC or Marvel comics; I've only seen some of the movies and shows. When I first saw this, I was unaware that there were going to be more films after this and how they would lead up to ""The Avengers"". Either way, I was impressed.The acting was excellent; I'm pretty sure Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Tony Stark and of course Gwyneth Peltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges were good for their roles. This was, of course, the first appearances of Agent Coulson and Nick Fury and I like them both. I also like Jarvis (Tony's A.I.) I was surprised to hear that some of the dialogue was actually improvised and not scripted; they did well with that. The special effects were fantastic, especially with the suits and explosions. I loved it when Tony is testing his flight suit and he keeps on blasting himself into a wall; pretty funny. Also he crashing through the roof and being sprayed by his fire extinguisher was humorous. He shooting a rocket at a tank and just walks away as it explodes was quite amusing.I enjoyed the action scenes, such as Tony escaping his captors, Tony attacking the Ten Rings in his new suit, and of course the final battle with Obadiah. There were a few parts that I thought were kind of slow. Not boring, just kind of slow. I enjoyed the last scene: ""The truth is..I am Iron Man."" And then everybody goes crazy.""Iron Man"" is probably one of the best superhero movies ever. It was a good way start off the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" and one of my favorite superhero films.

What I also liked about this film was that the director had used the original intro just like the comic book series in the 60's. I also like the Iron man mark 1 Armour I just loved it even thought it was only in the film for like 5-10 mins I still think it was just amazing. I also loved the actor that played Tony Stark a.k.a Iron man. He was funny and just perfect for the role of Iron man. I thought the plot was interesting and I thought the villain (Iron Monger) was also interesting and what I was surprised with was that his outfit was Silver and not blue from the comics and in the Iron man 2 figures number 35 you can see the classic Armour of the Iron Monger.Overall I thought this movie was great and I would Highly recommend people to see this film especially for fans of Iron man.","

"Iron Man","vip_ebriega","2 January 2009","My Take: Robert Downey Jr. is the real treat here. Comic-book movies are growing up! After the success of a revamped BATMAN franchise and the SPIDER-MAN pictures which successfully venture beyond its basic premise, it's about time Marvel's metal-suited action hero to get his share of the spotlight. I'm talking about IRON MAN, of course. And it's quite a surprise. Thankfully, IRON MAN doesn't fall on the tragic path of cheesiness and artificiality like the FANTASTIC FOUR pictures. Instead, IRON MAN is nearly as potent and mature as the SPIDER-MAN pictures, although not as dark or sinister as the new BATMAN pictures.That's fine however, since IRON MAN aims for a different approach. It's a comic book adventure for adults. It's mature and geared more to adults than on the little tykes, yet it still has the feel of a comic book movie. It's got flashy action sequences that are lighter than those in Chris Nolan's new BATMAN movies, including a rock 'em sock 'em battle between Iron Man and a larger metal-suited behemoth. It tackles deeper issues than most superhero/comic-book movies (maybe even deeper than the SPIDER-MAN movies), but it never forgets to be fun, even in the forgettable sense. Robert Downey Jr. makes an eccentric Tony Stark, a weapons industrialist and a genius, not to mention a playboy. Think Bruce Wayne meets Nicolas Cage in LORD OF WAR. Ironically, he's a superhero's own worst enemy. He sells nuclear weapons of the best quality. But after being captured by a underground terrorists asking him to re-build a weapon of his to be used against the Americans, he suits himself up with an artificial ""heart"" and a metal suit armed to the teeth to blow you apart.From eccentric weapons engineer, Stark finishes his advance armored suit and turns himself into a real man-of-steel of the title, much to the dismay of his superior Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, who looks exactly like William Hurt in another Marvel-based movie of the year THE INCREDIBLE HULK), who wants Stark Industries to continue producing the latest in weapons technology. Gwyneth Paltrow also stars as Pepper Potts, Stark's assistant. But the real star is Downey Jr., a superb actor who gives deeper dimension to the typical superhero alter-ego. If the explosions and eye-popping special effects will be gone the moment you step out of the theater, the character of Tony Stark will stay with you like a person you just met. The character is funny, eccentric but most of all, memorable. Director Jon Favreau may not stage the action as good as Christopher Nolan's BATMAN pictures or like Sam Raimi of the SPIDER-MAN films, but he handles the characters real well. IRON MAN is a good start for the summer movie season, but it isn't just a while-you-wait blockbuster for THE DARK KNIGHT (arguably the summer's best picture).Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.","

"Iron Man","TheRetroCritic","4 November 2023","Directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man was released in 2008, only a month before The Incredible Hulk, and it marked the official beginning of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. After some time away from the limelight, Robert Downey Jr. Was cast as Tony Stark and the rest is history.This was a big, expensive gamble for Marvel and, had it not paid off, it's unlikely that much would have stemmed from it. Luckily, Iron Man was a significant hit that, not only kick-started one of the biggest cinematic franchises ever, but revived Robert Downey Jr.'s career fully, pushing the actor's popularity to stellar levels. While the story in the film is pretty self-contained, it does plant a few major seeds (S. H. I. E. L. D., War Machine) and, of course, Tony Stark would, soon after, cameo in The Incredible Hulk so Marvel were already very determined to build towards an Avengers movie and Iron Man certainly set the standard.The plot of the film sees Tony Stark, the cocky owner of defense contractor Stark Industries, get kidnapped by a terrorist group in Afghanistan where he is forced to face a few uncomfortable truths about his own company while trying to survive. During this ordeal, he loses a friend but develops an arc reactor to keep himself alive and power a state-of-the-art Iron Man suit, as you do.The storytelling here is straight-forward but effective: Jon Favreau balances character development, action sequences and humor in an effortless way, giving the film a refreshingly breezy and light-hearted, yet clever and witty, tone inspiring subsequent Marvel outings, with the exception of the slightly grumpier The Incredible Hulk which had the misfortune to be shot at the same time. Robert Downey Jr. Is simply perfect as Tony Stark. He embodies the nonchalant genius aspect of the character with ease and he balances Stark's inherent flaws with so much charm that you can't help but be on the billionaire playboy's side no matter what.Gwyneth Paltrow is very likable as Stark's assistant/love interest Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges clearly has a ball as the intimidating, and rather amusing, villain Obadiah Stane. Terrence Howard was also well cast as Stark's friend Rhodey but the role was eventually handed to Don Cheadle, who made it his own. This is one of those few superhero movies where everything gels to create not just a worthy comic-book to film adaptation but a genuinely good blockbuster as well.Iron Man was, and it remains, a slick, funny and hugely entertaining action film with tons of charm and personality, some pitch-perfect special effects and a ground-breaking approach to the superhero genre in cinema. This is one of Marvel's all-time best movies and it still very much holds up.Excellent.","

"Iron Man","haydenluz","24 July 2020","Iron Man, directed by Jon Favreau, is a fun, inventive, and energetic superhero film, that, unlike some of the other MCU films, can stand on it's own. This is arguably one of the best origin stories the MCU has offered up yet, having some memorable scenes throughout. Favreau worked in some great cohesive elements to juice up Tony Stark's back story, to give him some nice depth. It was such a nice relief that this wasn't just a stepping stone, to get a main character introduced, and that be it; Favreau gave us great context to who Stark is, and where he comes from. With Stark's back story set aside, the premise of the film wasn't the most original concept, with some cliché and predictable moments, but it's fine with Kevin Feige adding that Marvel flare throughout the film. The pacing of the film was decent for the most part, until the third act, and thats where the film takes it's major down turn. Everything feels rushed together, while making it feel like just another final act of a Marvel film; there was no real style to it.Robert Downey Jr. was the absolute driving force for this film! Between his arrogant, yet charming performance, to his seamless chemistry with everybody on screen, he just absolutely steals the show, without this being a one man show. I personally related to his character a lot due to the snarky, and slick comments, while also having that genuine work ethic that he poses. The writers gave Stark some good characters archs throughout the narrative, while including great risks and vulnerabilities. RDJ's performance was well recognized and respected, especially after the antics he was personally going through before the casting of the film. His timing to everything was impeccable, with this infectious charisma that simply grows on you before the first act is even finished. RDJ gave a great portrayal to the lowkey comic book character, while making him more well known and likable. Even though Downey Jr. was the star of the show, the supporting characters had a great deal with the success to this as well. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have a whole lot to do in the film, but she puts on a fine performance, being a great compliment to Tony Stark. She is probably the best love intrest between them all, offering something more than being a simple damsel in distress. I just love Terrence Howard, so seeing him casted as Rhodes was really fun for me, while it was also a smart casting, consider Howard plays in these types of roles often. Howard was another great compliment to Tony Stark, playing another character that doesn't really tolerate his antics, and tries to keep him as grounded as possible. Jeff Bridges is our main villain, and he is just whatever. His motive is somewhat there, but the execution was so fast and bland, having no actual critical plan going into everything. He ended up being a pretty dumb villain that was just wasted. On the plus side, Jeff Bridges tried his best, and made the most out of every scene he was in.The screenplay by Art Marcum, Matt Halloway, Mark Fergus, and Hawk Ostby was pretty strong. The narrative felt cohesive, although they couldn't avoid some superhero clichés. The dialogue between everyone carried some weight, with some great jokes along the way. Some of the banter between characters felt improvised, but it worked in almost every application, giving the writting more of a genuine feel.The action wasn't heavily relied on when you think in terms of the MCU, but it was balanced real well with the story, not just throwing random action scenes in, to run the budget up even more. The visual effects were surprisingly not heavily relied on either, but for this being one of Marvel's first films with CG, it was decent.Overall, Iron Man is probably my favorite stand-alone film of the MCU, having great characters, fun writting, and a decent story.","

It was fun, to-the-point, and surprising inspirational.I liked the special effects. They weren't over-the-top (I've seen superhero movies with shiner, fancier things) but they were suitable to the story and, if I can say so, fairy realistic and down-to-earth. Nothing splashy, just what was necessary.I like the idea. Iron Man is an awesome superhero.So no, I really can't compare it to anything, but for all intents and purposes I enjoyed it.","

"Iron Man","Hitchcoc","6 November 2009","I got a kick out of this film. I have never seen one of the comic books nor do I know about the exploits of this figure. It is a nicely done superhero film which traces the origins of the character. Robert Downey is quite good, balancing his innate arrogance against his good intentions. Jeff Bridges is also an excellent adversary. One of the most impressive scenes in the move is the opening in the deserts of Afghanistan as a roadside bomb explodes and Downey and a group of soldiers come under fire. It really gives one a sense of what those people face each day. It may even be a bit real for a fantasy romp like this is. It is down and dirty. There are great events, including the building of the first suit and his effort to exact revenge against the forces that have used his weapons systems to persecute and destroy the civilian population. There is a lot of action and it's not superfluous. Downey's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow and the robots in his lab are a lot of fun. For pure escapism, it's really fun. I assume the sequel is on its way.","

This story is a realistic and fluent piece of science fiction. Tony Stark has a incredible motivation and RDJ is just unbelievable. He becomes iconic with this character. Jeff Bridges is amazing too but Obadiah Stane's motivation is not so so well for me. On the other hand CGI's are great for 2008. Finally, I can easily say that Iron Man is one of the best MCU movies.","

"Iron Man","Bolesroor","23 October 2008","What did I love about Ironman? Was it Robert Downey, Jr.? Not really... he was good, not great. Was it all the CGI hardware and effect shots? They were fun, but that's not it. I think what I loved was the fact that the movie grabs you from frame one and pulls you instantly, effortlessly, into an aggressive, fat-free narrative with drive... the story moves at light speed, and by the time you realized you haven't touched your popcorn you're in the solid center of a great comic book/superhero movie. The film is also a blueprint for the way all modern movies should be made. Welcome to century 21...See, most superhero movies start with a first act that tastes like medicine. They're dour, solemn setups about nuclear accidents, childhood traumas and secret identities... it's redundant. We are now the sons and daughters of the MTV generation, in an omni-media world, and we know movies like the French know wine. Just put on the damn cape and start fighting crime! This is where Ironman makes even newer hits like ""Spiderman"" and ""Batman Begins"" look like creaky old dinosaurs; the first act is a self-contained mini-movie, as Tony Stark builds the suit not out of an idle need to do good, but to save his own life by escaping from his captors.By the time Tony Stark is back home the movie has brilliantly weaved in all the exposition and back-story we need to enjoy the fun. Directors Steven Spielberg & George Lucas spoke about collaborating on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and they maintained it was impossible to make an action movie without a ""pointer scene,"" a flat, boring, talky sequence which serves only to fill in the back-story and set up the rest of the film. They named this after the scene in ""Raiders"" in which a government official literally puts a pointer to a chalkboard as he lectures Indy about the history of the Ark. Maybe it's a change of the guard, but there is no pointer scene in Ironman. You pick up as you go, and the payoff is a film that rewards you for being smart and paying attention.Director Jon Favreau has to take the credit for the film's greatness. He makes this movie for the audience as he would make a film for himself or his friends; no dumbing-down, no compromised corn or clichéd studio stupidity. He is so committed to this story, so sure that this fantasy is real that he dares you to question it in scenes like the one in which Tony basically asks his secretary to perform open-heart surgery on him. You'll buy it. We're so deep into the brilliant fever dream that it all seems joyfully plausible. Bravo...Ironman should stand as a lesson to ALL filmmakers: stop underestimating your audience. It is the twenty-first century and we've seen everything. Twice. Stop trying to paint by the numbers and just paint. Ironman is a great leap in cinematic storytelling... I hope it's just a beginning.GRADE: A","

Fortunately for audiences, the overall result is strong.Basically, Iron Man is about a billionaire businessman and weapon scientist who has a change of heart after he is injured in a war zone. He develops a new energy source and body armor that give him the ability to fight terrorists - especially those who are using weapons he helped develop. But things turn out to be a little more complicated than they seem ...If you like special effects - this movie has scenes that won't disappoint. The body armor / suit looks pretty cool and the flying sequences are outstanding. (There's an older movie called the ""Rocketeer"" which had similar scenes, but didn't capitalize enough on them enough like this movie).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow all do great acting jobs - especially Jeff Bridges, whose performance is superb. While the editing and some aspects of the plot seem a bit too rushed at times, the overall movie succeeds anyway.It's hard to think about who would 'not' enjoy at least something in this movie - so it's pretty easy to state that this one's worth seeing for just about everyone.","

"Iron Man","fantasyescapist","6 May 2008","Another year, another superhero film unleashed on the public mid-spring to begin the summer blockbusters hitting the cinema.For starters, I've never read any Marvel comic book, talk less of this particular one on which this film is based, so if you're expecting a review from a comic book fan, look elsewhere. But if you want to read a opinion from an everyday cinema goer, then continue reading.Acting: I felt the leading man was good in his role - he plays the deadpan, womanising and sardonic character well. The sort of hedonistic persona and charming he portrays as a weapons manufacturer works, even if his voice can seem a bit monotonous to me. Jeff Bridges' acting that really stole the show for me. He plays Obadiah, who at first is friendly towards Stark but then becomes horrified and greedy when Tony has a change of heart about his job and turns on him. I could tell he was clearly relishing the role and it's the first time I've seem him act as a 'baddie'. Utterly menacing and powerful. I thought Gwyneth Paltrow's acting as Peppa Potts was decent in places, like the banter between her and Tony but certain shouting from her towards the end during the climax came across as somewhat unbelievable. It doesn't help that the character feels quite cut-and-paste. The chemistry between Potts and Stark didn't ring true for me either - it felt unconvincing to me, and I felt more convinced by Downey Jr.'s acting in those scenes than hers. Terrence Howard was decent too, even if his character wasn't in that many scenes and felt generic.Pacing: Quite rushed to me. This is an introduction or origin story, but once the suit is built, it sort of looses it's way as it hurries to finish the film with a final fight climax. Individual scenes didn't seem to be completed in a satisfying way front my point of view and I felt like I was missing out on a longer scene -they quickly finished and moved on to the next. The action scenes in it were brief and not sustained for full enjoyment and the climax a disappointment, in my opinion. The very topical Afghanistan and the scenes where Stark is tied up and battles there do disturb but relate and update the story to today's world and conflicts which I thought was good.Cinematography: Well, I thought the special effects were terrific - the suit looked amazing on screen and photo-real and the flight scenes, if short, were soaring and fun to see. The robot-armed assistant in the lab was funny and sweet and the technology looked in ways possible, which speaking tech in the suit and lab.Music: Didn't find the score that memorable to me, but the music did heighten the mood in places but maybe another watch will make it more so, who knows? The rock songs did suit the high-flying, tongue-in-cheek and fun atmosphere of the film, though.Overall: An ironic film(in the sense that he's wounded by his own weapons, and his weapons are used against him in a sense etc), that's good and entertaining, if quite a hastened action film that has some snappy and deadpan chuckles here and there, amazing special effects and good acting mostly. Downey Jr. is an interesting, thoughtful and different superhero. Shame the battle at the end climax comes across as generic and it ends too soon, feeling too easily finished, but worth seeing I feel, if you like films of this genre - 6.7/10.","

"Iron Man","johnnymacbest","29 April 2008","Spider-Man 3 and Ghost Rider SUCKED to the highest extent of the comic-to-movie craze of the millennium. 2007 was a bad year for superhero movies so I came in with low expectations to see Iron Man. The previews looked good but I feared I will be disappointed again and suspect that Marvel has lost its touch after the first two Spider-Man and X-Men films. Well, to be honest I was THOROUGHLY impressed and ENTERTAINED at the same time!!! This film EASILY blows those two crapfests mentioned earlier out of the water completely with an intelligent and well written plot, good acting, action, special effects and most importantly character development, something Sider-Man 3 completely neglected to do. The less said about Ghost Rider the better. But the real star of the show is no doubt the unlikely casting choice of Mr. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His performance really caught me off guard in almost every aspect as a charming, no-nonsense, weapons-making womanizer whose at first glance ""imbeded"" with man's destructive nature but ultimately rises with a heart of gold. Gwyneth Paltow is both sexy and sweet as Stark's secretary who keeps him from slipping further; nice to see a woman whose smart and sexy with real depth in a comic book movie. Jon Favreau's direction is top-notch and knows the material well; moreover, this is the first Marvel film made independently of any major studio. I also like that the Iron Man armor is a combination of CGI and practical effects, helped along by Stan Winston, the king of practical movie effects and his work and attention to detail is very impressive as shown in the past. Though there's lots of humor in Iron Man, it never becomes overbearing and OTT like Spider-Man 3 whose idea of humor is more on the lines of an SNL sketch. My only negatives are some underdeveloped characters and the liberties taken with the Iron Man comics (Tony Stark being captured in Afghanistan rather than Vietnam, not delving into his alcoholism) but those are miner hiccups in an otherwise stellar movie.In conclusion: Iron Man is the best Marvel movie made and I'm eagerly awaiting future installments and after seeing this awesome film I can say wholeheartedly and sincerely that Marvel has truly redeemed itself. See it and be blown away!!!","

Now, at the age of 44, Iron Man Iron Man has re-ignited my dream of tearing through the sky at unimaginable speeds (while blowing the crap out of anyone who gets in my way!).A super-slick, witty, thrill-a-minute, action-packed comic-book adventure laden with top-notch effects and blessed with an excellent cast, Iron Man is easily the best Marvel adaptation that I have seen to date (although, admittedly, I've fallen a long way behind when it comes this particular genre).Jon Favreau's direction is so good, it's hard to believe that the same guy who went on to give us Cowboys & Aliens; Robert Downey Jr. is superb in the role of Tony Stark, the weapons manufacturer who has a change of heart (quite literally) and decides to dedicate his genius to helping mankind by creating a hi-tech suit with which he battle the bad guys; likewise, Jeff Bridges is terrific as his nemesis, evil corporation man Obadiah, who wants to continue dealing in death with the enemy; and Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely lovely as plucky woman in peril Pepper Potts (she's no Jennifer Connelly, though... give me the brunette over the blonde any day of the week!).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.","

"Iron Man","Bob_Zerunkel","16 May 2012","I couldn't get past the opening. They opened with Stark being a drunk and a whoremonger.In the first battle, a guy screams at him and then he gets ripped apart. The Humvee that Stark is in gets riddled with holes from the projectiles. Stark would have been liverwurst at that point.Then we find out that his heart condition is now merely shrapnel.And that's all I could stand.Why couldn't they make an Ironman movie about Ironman? Why did they have to make one about some god-awful person who was only fit for a Kardashian wedding.They could have had a decent movie that was faithful to Ironman and used the same plot.Extremely poor if you like Ironman. Maybe okay if you favor crap.I won't regret not seeing this turkey, but I do regret the five minutes that I spent seeing how badly they treated a pretty decent character.This movie gets one star for the casting. Robert Downey Junior is a true piece of trash, and his real life fits exactly the despicable person that they turned Tonly Stark into.","

"Iron Man","captkirk_4","19 December 2008","Spoilers: Now I have to tell you up front, I had never heard of the Ironman character until this movie came out. But the word everywhere was that this was one of the best superhero movies to date so not being a theater goer, I eagerly anticipated it's release on DVD. What I saw was horrible. Yes there were some cool scenes of him flying around in the suit, most of which I had already seen on Ebert & Roper. I'll admit, this concept had potential, but the plot was horrendous.First of all, I for one, am truly sick to death of hearing about Bush's wars in the middle east and setting most of the movie in Afganistan was a horrible idea. I go to such fantasy movies to escape reality, not be reminded of national tragedy. Besides in superhero movies the villains are supposed to be larger than life. This is about as cheesy as the old comics from the 40's showing Superman fighting Tojo, etc. Setting this in Afganistan very much dates this movie and as current events subside, this movie will become unwatchable in a generation. Imagine if Tim Burton's Batman was about not Batman confronting the Joker, but Batman taking on Manuel Norriega, the victim of the regimes propaganda machine at the time. No one would watch it today, fortunately Tim Burton knew better than to give us such trash.Another thing that didn't work for me was the flipping back and forth in time. This is confusing, even in a show I like such as NBC's HEROES. I'm not too fond of this technique and wish it were kept to an absolute minimum. And where it works is where the jump is a foreshadow of the very ending like Lawrence of Arabia, or Fight Club. This movie started out with a random scene from the middle of the movie. The chronological storytelling in Spiderman would have been much better here, especially as Ironman isn't as well known to the public as the Superman, Spiderman, or Batman characters.But the most truly dreadful scene that caused this movie to jump the shark in my opinion was were he invented the Ironman suit as a hostage in a cave. This was so utterly ridiculous, the most sophisticated technology yet created by man in a medieval lockup. The creation of the second suit in the lab I could see, and I wish that point is where this movie began and they rewrote the whole script without the Islamic terrorist crap. On the bright side I did like Robert Downey Jr's work in here and also though Jeff Bridges did a decent job with his new creepy look. But all in all this was a waste of a DVD rental fee and I now have little faith in the taste of all these teenage video game nerds.","

"Iron Man","DJAkin","5 May 2008","Iron Man was a pretty good movie. It is obvious that Robert Downey Jr has found his true calling. He is a very convincing super hero. I am not a comic book fanatic and don't really know much about the history of Iron Man. However, you don't need to know this to really enjoy the movie. A barely recognizable Jeff Bridges plays a big part in this movie. His head is shaved yet his voice sounds pretty much like ol' Jeff Bridges. There are a few corny scenes in this movie that include Terrence Howard. Yes, there is a scene where he looks at a very shiny Iron Man outfit and says ""another time"". In other words this movie is being set up for a SEQUEL! Movie purists will scoff at the scene when Iron Man FLEW from the United States into Afghanistan beat up a few people and then came back. Purists will question how HE DID THIS? How did he go to the bathroom while flying that distance? Or how about when he was testing out his flight suit and was body slammed against the wall at about 70 MPH? He didn't even get INJURED? Also, that funky looking FAKE HEART that was installed in his chest was not fully explained. All in all, a great movie. Not enough special effects. This isn't like Batman when there is a lot of crime fighting. There were a few scenes when it would have been appropriate for Jack Bauer to show up, especially when that bald terrorist was going to make that one guy CHEW on a RED HOT ROCK. Sheesh, talk about a horrible method of torture!! Two thumbs up!","

"Iron Man","TomCruiseFan99","25 September 2008","The inspired casting which allowed Robert Downey Jr. to play the title character was a masterstroke of genius. Downey Jr. always dispenses the right amount of wisecracks and barbs in his roles, and when added to a fun action romp, becomes totally enjoyable for the family. It also helps that finally, a superhero movie gets some brilliant actors to elevate the story, and solid support is displayed by Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard.The story is full of typical superhero movie clichés, but there's a freshness and a spark to the story that makes it all seem so original. It still, IMHO, cant surpass The Dark Knight or X-Men 2 but it comes pretty close. And wayyyyy better than the lame Spider-man movies, and the obnoxious Fantastic 4 movies.Tony Stark (Iron Man's alter ego) is at first a military weapons developer, and the filmmakers make it all relevant to modern-day dilemmas, when Stark finds out that his weapons are being used by the very terrorists the U.S Military are supposed to be fighting. This revelation and his capture by terrorists at the beginning, helps to change his outlook on life and thus begins his plan to not just fight crime, but to tackle greed and terrorism (since they seem to go hand-in-hand).The action scenes are crisply shot, and the movie features some of the best special effects of the year. The CGI effects seem so real that it's so easy to accept what you're seeing on the screen. And if you're wondering if there'll be a sequel on the way, the very last line of the movie practically gives you your answer. A fantastic action spectacle, with good actors, great story and brilliant visuals. Don't miss it!","

"Iron Man","cobyscomics","26 January 2014","(from http://cobyscomics.blogspot.com/2014/01/iron-man.html) This movie set the stage for such great things to come. Truthfully, I believe if Robert Downey, Jr. had not done the marvel-ous job he did portraying the ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,"" then we would not even be talking about a MCU.Downey's brilliance is in his one-liners, those quips he delivers so perfectly they stick in your head for days afterward. You know what I'm talking about, like when he first dons the original Iron Man armor and absorbs all that AK fire, then turns around and says, ""my turn"".Or, the ultimate one-liner, the one that really sold the movie and made everyone like Black Sabbath again, ""I am Iron Man"".One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Tony gets Pepper's small hands to help him switch out mini-Arc Reactors. When she yanks that copper ring out, I almost fell off the couch laughing.And, yeah, OK, we've got to suspend disbelief for the scene to work, but so what? This is a superhero movie, it's all about suspending disbelief.Speaking of Pepper Potts, this movie did more for female supporting actresses than anything I can remember in a long time. She's more than just a damsel in distress. Not only does she help Tony Stark do everything (including remember his Social Security Number)--which, incidentally, is nearly identical to the relationship I have with my own wife (sans the whole billionaire playboy thing)--but she plays a major role in this movie. She becomes even more important as the Iron Man trilogy goes on, but we see shades of that in this first movie, where she even helps Iron Man defeat the Iron Monger at the end. So, yeah, I say, give Pepper her own movie! I'd watch it.My other favorite scene from Iron Man is when he goes back to Afghanistan to blow up all of the Stark Industries weapons. First off, I'd like to point out how much better the Tony Stark in Afghanistan origin story is than Tony Stark in Vietnam or Tony Stark in the Gulf. The creators of this movie took Stan Lee's original idea of having Iron Man be the anti-communist and updated it to make him the anti-terrorist. Secondly, it's always fun watching the movie and telling people, ""hey, Bagram Air Field, that's where I was for 6 months"" and ""yeah, Konar Province is a real place, and it's really bad"".But, yeah, how badass is it when Iron Man shoots his little missile and then turns around, with the tank blowing up behind him? Hard core.One thing my wife spotted in Iron Man that I completely missed was the Ten Rings flag.This is the same terrorist organization that the ""Mandarin"" would go on to ""lead"" in Iron Man 3. I can't believe I didn't notice this before! By calling this organization the ""Ten Rings"", Marvel was setting up the villain for the third film way back in 2008 when the first one came out. Just another example of why I love the MCU and Marvel's Master Plan.I love how pretty much every movie in the MCU culminates in a Final Battle. Iron Man started this trend, and I love it! In Iron Man we get two giant robots fighting on the streets--how awesome is that! The Iron Monger hits Tony with a motorcycle, smashes him through a bus, and flies him into inner-space, all while taunting him in that great Jeff Bridges Evil TRON Supervillain voice. And it ends with anti-damsel Pepper blowing up the Arc Reactor with a Big Badda Boom that can be seen from space.Finally, we get to the Deleted/Extended Scenes, which I watched for the first time on this viewing of Iron Man. Unlike most movies' deleted scenes, I was actually glad they cut almost all of what they did. If I had seen those Airmen doing their Parade Deck Rifle Drill in the original movie, it probably would've made me hate the thing. The one Deleted Scene they probably should've kept showed Obadiah Stane actually falling into the Arc Reactor before Pepper blew it up. They left him getting blowed up implied in the original movie, which is always dangerous because it leaves things open for one of those comicbook revivals they like to do.Overall, Iron Man was a fantastic movie, one that kicked the whole MCU off. I'd say it, with Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance, is one of the most important superhero movies ever made. Overall, I'd give it a 9 out of 10 stars.Oh yeah, we can't forget the obligatory Stan Lee cameo! In Iron Man, he appears as none other than the original Playboy, Hugh Hefner","

"Iron Man","accounts_only","29 January 2015","Lot's of action, comedy and really cool effects. Iron Man can keep the whole family entertained with action for the parents, a superhero for the kids and an action packed adventure with a superhero for the adults who still think they're kids. With a refreshingly underused plot Iron Man brings something new to the movie table and Robert Downey Jr's cocky portrayal of Iron Man keeps you laughing throughout. Some may be scrutinising this film if they know the Iron Man story well but I am not familiar with them and find it a 10. These people may rate it a little less but if you love explosions, bust ups and superheroes I don't see how you're experience could go much differently to mine :DFor me the best part about Iron Man is the fact he becomes a superhero almost by accident and the film deals with issues the world faces a lot like terrorism and evil. Potts is your typical love interest of a superhero and may seem a little cheesy at times but Gwyneth Paltrow works so well with RDJ that it slips your mind most of the time anyway. Overall Iron Man is a fantastic film that I will watch over and over again :)","

"Iron Man","adamsmith-51004","15 April 2021","When it first came out in 2008, I don't think anybody expected it to be as big a hit as it was.It's a great backstory and introduction to the characters surrounding Tony Stark. The plot is fairly simple - but to contain the origin story the movie can't do much more without becoming bloated (see most other Marvel movies). So the Obediah Stane ""Iron Monger"" (really, we aren't going to say anything about that villain name?) plays out as a way for Stark to physically reject the way Stark industries has gone and turn it to a new direction.His change in world view and progression from selfish weapons mogul to tech-hero is fairly smooth.Iron Man is a great character. His is a reflection of the role of industry in conflicts - issues of autonomy, government supervision, and loyalties play at the heart of the character. When his heart is damaged, he changes his loyalties and uses his genius and entrepreneurial power for the betterment of others instead of himself or his company. And this movie does a decent job of showing that.Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Tony Stark and is possibly the best casting in the MCU.","

"Iron Man","wcmb","12 October 2008","Another special effects film which means if you want good dialog, character development and chemistry walk away now. I thought this one was going to be good and was greatly disappointed. The special effects are fine and predictable and like so many superhero films of late the characters are one-dimensional. The fact that Favreau left the dialog up to the leads instead of investing in a good writer is apparent.Surprisingly Robert Downey Jr. is just okay. His Tony Stark is mildly appealing and his scenes in the lab are probably the best in the film, maybe it's because he is talking to inanimate objects and his computer. He has better chemistry with JARVIS (Paul Bettany) than anyone else in the picture.Gwyneth Paltrow brings nothing to her part. She is again the wooden girl, but there isn't much to the part. Anyone could play it and someone else might have been convincing in her scenes with Robert Downey Jr.Terence Howard seems miscast. For a military man his character is soft and has no military bearing. It's too bad because he's a much better actor than he is allowed to be in this film.Jeff Bridges seems to have a lot of fun with his role. He plays it for fun and it shows. He is the only one who seems to be playing his part for what it is. Everyone else is either taking it too seriously or just can't seem to get past their own parts.If you haven't seen this movie save yourself some cash and rent it. You won't feel like you've wasted any money that way.","

"Iron Man","DonFishies","3 May 2008","There is really little to say about the plot of Iron Man that most people do not already know about. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is an obnoxiously wealthy CEO of a US weapons manufacturing company who is taken hostage in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. He manages to create an armoured suit he wears to escape his terrorist captors, and returns to the US a changed man.I was a little apprehensive getting hyped up over Iron Man. I was never a huge fan of the character, and with Jon Favreau at the wheel, it did not exactly sound like it was going to be as great as other comic book films like X2: X-Men United, Batman Begins or the Spider-Man sequels (my personal favourite remains Tim Burton's Batman from '89). But rather impressively, the film is much better than I think anyone could have expected.For one, Stark's characterization is a little more rounded than most. Much like Bruce Wayne, he is not really a superhero by the standard definition, but more someone who becomes one. He has the skeletons in the closet, he is a womanizing prick, and he's a border-line (if not full blown) alcoholic. He is not shown as in-depth as Batman was in Batman Begins, but the work put into his evolvement is much better than a typical comic book film.It also helps that Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Stark. I do not think anyone could have pulled him off anywhere near as well. He has just the right amount of cynicism, sarcasm and wit to make the character truly memorable. Any fan of the character, or anyone just looking for an actor putting in the work needed for his character to be believable should look no further. Downey Jr.'s own sketchy past only helps make his portrayal even more credible of someone living the high life, and then re-evaluating themselves and changing to be a better person. It almost speaks as a bit of a metaphor for his own journey, and makes his work here that much more personal. His wounded eyes speak volumes for him and the character.Unfortunately, as far as origin stories usually go, there is not a lot of room for the supporting characters to shine. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's assistant Pepper Potts, but Terrence Howard's Jim Rhodes is very much underused. We know of his importance to the story, but he never truly overcomes the flaw of just being a smarter and more successful tokin' black guy we all know from the years of stereotypes. He sets himself up for future installments, but I think his dialogue could have been fleshed out to be a little more useful than it is here. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane is another underused character, but Bridges manages to chew up a lot of scenery when he is on-screen. I think this may be his most involved and most fun performance since The Big Lebowski.The story itself is another great thing about the film, because it is nowhere near as far-fetched as most origin stories. While the creation of some of the more scientific elements may seem preposterous, its real world basis makes it miraculously relevant to the current war time events going on as we speak. This is a character who could only work after 9/11, and coming out now is probably the best move any studio could have ever made. Stark's story is one for this generation, and I think by not glossing anything over, the filmmakers have done justice to a character who cannot be any timelier. I also like that it focused a lot of attention on the meticulous work he does creating the suit, and showing his little failures along the way. The humour injected into a lot of scenes is also very well done.If anything at all, it could have used a bit of editing here and there however, shaving some time off in Afghanistan and the suit creations (as much as I liked them). Some of the dialogue is a little off as well (especially with Howard's character), and could have been tightened to better effect. I realize that these portrayals are based off comic book characters, but that does mean their dialogue automatically needs to be cheesy, or so silly that it needs to be funny.The special effects are another marvel, making the preposterous science elements seem even more real. Just watching the scene where Stark is trying out his suit's flying capabilities before creating the rest of the suit may be enough to make the film's imaginative structure look authentic. Yes, it does have a few moments where it looks fake and could have used more work, but for the most part, this may be the most fully rendered and realistic looking comic book character to date (in the realm of relying heavily on CGI of course).And as for Favreau, I was very impressed with the way the film handles itself. He truly kept it on the rails, and did not let its ambitiousness become too much for him. Yes, there are flaws, and yes, the film is imperfect. But for someone whose name I doubt could have ever been synonymous with creating action-orientated films before (not counting the family fantasy Zathura), Favreau has truly outdone himself. He has brought a complex character to the big screen, and has created one of the strongest comic book films to date. As I said earlier, I had my apprehensions, but his work here can only lead to bigger and better things.From its startling opening all the way up to its action infused finale, Iron Man is great film in every respect and one hell of a start for the summer movie season. It has its flaws, but the finesse of the story and the lead character make it truly memorable.8.5/10.","

"Iron Man","lastliberal","6 May 2008","I don't want to hear from those comic book readers on whether or not this is a true representation. This is the movie, and it rock! Robert Downey Jr. was born for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, and I cannot wait to see him later this Summer in The Incredible Hulk, and in Iron Man II, which just has to be made.Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is just the hottest assistant a man can have, and I cannot, for the life of me, understand why he is not... every day.The two of them together is just screen magic and the banter between them is just so charged with sexual energy - it is just amazing.Terrence Howard was great as his Air Force buddy, and Jeff Bridges was perfect as the man you wanted to see die - every more than the terrorists, and you know that is the truth.The special effects were absolutely out of this world.If there is any criticism of all of this movie, it is that it could have been more adult. A little fun with Leslie Bibb, the stews on the plan giving us a real pole dance...Ah, but they have to tone it down to get the bucks from the teens.It still rocks.","

"Iron Man","evanston_dad","13 May 2008","In much the same way that Ron Perlman's inspired performance made ""Hellboy"" better than it would otherwise have been, Robert Downey, Jr. helps ""Iron Man"" be something beyond the standard superhero junk fests that become popular every year around this time. Downey is perfectly cast, though I never would have thought of him for the character he plays here, tycoon of a weapons manufacturing company who suffers pangs of conscience after seeing what his terrible weapons can do, and turns himself into the ultimate weapon so that he can stop others from using them.Gwyneth Paltrow is Downey's assistant and love interest, and it's a bit of a shame to see such a smart actress stuck with such a dud role as this. She stands around in heels and looks worried while Downey tries to save her.Jeff Bridges, shaved bald and sporting a bushy beard, is the movie's villain, and if the movie has a major failing, it's him. Bridges is fine in the role, but the villain himself isn't particularly menacing, and the final showdown is anticlimactic.Be sure to sit through the end credits for a brief scene that promises a sequel.Grade: A-","

"Iron Man","Boba_Fett1138","4 October 2008","Basically this movie features all of the right ingredients needed to create a good superhero movie with. It has plenty of big and loud action, comedy, an evil villain, a love interest and of course a superhero in shiny armor. But ""Iron Man"" is actually somewhat more than just another big budget Hollywood action superhero movie. ""Iron Man"" tries it with a more down to Earth approach and tries to place things in perspective, instead of rather just letting things blow up. It's basically perfect entertainment to watch but also with some more layers to it, without ever getting dull or overdone.Perhaps one of the most surprising things about the movie is its cast. Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow all play roles you normally wouldn't expect to see them in. Robert Downey Jr. is definitely back again after his years of drug abuse and life in jail. His life so far perhaps even itself is already good enough to fill one feature length movie with. He isn't the type of actor for the main title role you think about when casting a superhero movie but he perfectly suits his role, with his dry sense of humor and acting skills. He's a tough, cold hearted, womanizer but yet due to Downey Jr.'s performance you care about his character. It's also great that Jeff Bridges plays the bald main villain of the movie. I'll bet he himself never expected ever to play a role such as this in a superhero movie.But no of course ""Iron Man"" isn't a very 'deep' movie and luckily foremost the movie still is an highly entertaining one, that is made very entertaining by Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as well as the movie its action.Iron Man perhaps isn't the best known comic book superhero but he's a real awesome one. He doesn't necessarily has 'superpowers' but simply is a man who happens to own billions of dollars and lots of industrial and weaponry knowhow. With this he knows to create a super-suite, that helps him to fly and has a kinds of other gadget build into it. It practically makes him indestructible to most dangers and enemies but luckily for us not all, or else it of course would had been a very boring superhero movie to watch.The movie features lots of action in it, that perhaps is not the most spectacular you've ever seen but it nevertheless is great looking, which mainly is thanks to its special effects. I seriously can't tell halve of the what's real and what is CGI in this movie. What also really adds to the movie its action is its sound. The movie has some real excellent sound and I sense an Oscar nomination coming up for it, as well as for it's special effects I would expect, perhaps also for the reason that this was special effects legend Stan Winston's last fully completed movie before his death earlier this year. It's not a movie that offers a lot of surprises but it features all of the right required ingredients and has something extra added to it as well. It makes ""Iron Man"" a real effective and entertaining, good looking, well made, modern superhero movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"Iron Man","JoeB131","4 May 2008","This film is awesome on so many levels.First, the performances. Downey completely dominates the role of Tony Stark, a guy who goes from being kind of an arrogant, self-absorbed jerk to a hero. He still manages to keep a sense of humor about him despite all that is happening. Paltrow is his unrequited assistant, Pepper Potts, and Jeff Bridges is the double-dealing Obediah Stane. All of the actors seamlessly meld into their characters.The story is very true to the original comics by Stan Lee, with updates to make it more contemporary. (In Lee's original, Stark has his origin as a prisoner in Vietnam.) Unlike a lot of Marvel Adaptations, they've made the story captivating, even if you are a hard-core comic fan who already knows the tale.The special effects, unlike some of FX sequences, are good but don't dominate the story. The same can be said of the action scenes.W","

"Iron Man","dee.reid","2 May 2008","""Iron Man,"" a cinematic adaptation of the popular Marvel Comics icon created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Don Heck and Larry Lieber in the early 1960s, is in many ways one of the best comic-to-film adaptations out there (perhaps because Marvel chose to fund this one themselves - the first move of its kind for this sort of movie). Despite having the usual trappings of the usual origin story, ""Iron Man"" is pure fun. What makes this story stand out are two key factors: the smart-a**ed performance of a newly-reformed Robert Downey, Jr., and a smart-a**ed screenplay by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway.Working behind the camera (and sharing an on screen cameo) is director Jon Favreau of ""Swingers"" fame. An admitted Marvel Comics aficionado, Favreau seemed to be the perfect guy to direct an adaptation of Marvel's Man of Steel. Of course, I've never been able to land a copy of an Iron Man comic myself, but I've always admired the character (those who have read my reviews know that Spider-Man is my greatest comic book superhero). As an aside, fans will also realize that Iron Man served as a partial inspiration for the landmark sci-fi picture ""RoboCop"" (1987), and the character is one of the many aliases of Wu-Tang Clan rapper Ghostface Killah, and his 1996 debut solo record was appropriately named ""Ironman.""As billionaire industrialist Tony Stark - who is in some ways analogous to DC Comics' Bruce Wayne/Batman - Robert Downey, Jr. is one of the smartest (and unlikeliest) casting choices for any superhero character thus far. He's got the smart-a** attitude, the irresponsible playboy demeanor, dry humor, vibrant sexuality, and the cool slyness of any man at ease with his wealth. While the comics had a Tony Stark who journeyed to Cold War-era Vietnam, Our Hero is now seen demonstrating his company's weapons technology in war-torn Bush Regime-era Afghanistan.After his U.S. Army convoy is attacked, we next see Stark being held captive by Islamic militants who want him to help build them one of his most lethal and effective ""toys"" from scratch. Stark, who now wears a device that helps keep shrapnel out of his heart (compliments of a fellow benevolent prisoner), thinks otherwise. Using the raw materials at his disposal, he plans to engineer a daring escape plan by constructing a powered suit of armor.After this huge action sequence, Stark returns to California's Stark Industries a changed man. No longer the arrogant rich-boy he was before, he has seen the light; undergoing a sort of philosophical awakening in Afghanistan after seeing the militants use his own weapons against U.S. forces there, he ceases weapons production at Stark Industries, much to the mortification of his business partner and surrogate father figure Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who eventually uses Stark's own technology against him to become the armored super-villain Iron Monger. Along for the ride, of course, is Stark's pretty assistant Pepper Potts (an amazingly well-cast Gwyneth Paltrow), who he starts putting the moves on and she seems to return the affection; there is also loyal best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), who in the comics, of course, eventually becomes War Machine.Yes. ""Iron Man"" is one heck of a fun ride. Yes. It is incredibly well-acted and directed. Robert Downey, Jr., an alcoholic himself and whose drug problems are well-documented in the annals of Hollywood celebrity hell, is perfectly cast as the rich playboy-turned-superhero Tony Stark/Iron Man. Stark's change-of-heart business philosophy and alcoholism battles and many personal demons were well-documented in the comics as well, thus furthering the true-to-life superhero portrayals defined by Marvel back in the '60s when the character first saw print. This is all something that Downey, Jr. plays incredibly well in the film, and it seems he not only looks like Stark, he IS Tony Stark. Also, most superhero movies make the mistake of having the protagonist just jumping into fray; not so with ""Iron Man."" Here, Stark's becoming the iron-clad superhero is a process, with a number of technical glitches that provide plenty of humorous bumps along the way to keep it from ever getting boring.Since the movie is typical superhero origin story stuff, it falls victim to it as well. The film of course ends in a fantastic super-powered showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger that kind of wore itself out after a few minutes in. We've seen so many of this stuff in the origin stories before, so let's just hope that like ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) - the greatest superhero movie ever - ""Iron Man 2/Iron Man Returns"" takes the time to really explore the depth of the character and make good with his many personal flaws.9/10","

"Iron Man","jmillerdp","5 May 2008","*** This review does include SPOILERS! Don't worry, I'll tell you when they begin! ***""Iron Man"" is a combination of great acting and good direction combined with an average script and mediocre film score.The best thing is clearly the choice of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead, along with all of the supporting casting. Lots of great actors and all good performances.Jon Favreau does a good job, here tackling a much larger production than he has in the past. He's said to be an actors' director, and that proves true here. The characters really pop off the screen and that's what makes this superhero movie unique! Of course, Favreau really should have stayed out of the film himself. He has a strange, small role that just makes it seem like he wanted to be in the movie, with no real purpose for doing so.What I didn't like as much was the script. Lots of good elements, but it's weighed down by what I would call Origin-Story Syndrome. By having to tell us all about how Iron Man came to be, the movie kind of becomes a procedural. Lots of explanation, and not as much time for adventure as you'd like.It is weird that there are still problems with this. The first major superhero movie, 1978's ""Superman"" got it right the first time. Why all subsequent superhero movies couldn't take its example is beyond me. ""Superman"" laid out the origin part of its story in the early part of the movie, and got done with it. The rest of the movie was a straight adventure, with the origin stuff all done.But, one movie after another since then didn't get the message. ""X-Men,"" ""Batman Begins,"" ""Fantastic Four,"" etc. all got weighed down by Origin-Story Syndrome. Too much going over how the superhero(es) came to be and not enough straight adventure.The other element that I wasn't excited about was the film score. Not something everyone would be concerned about. But, that standard rock-pop music stuff just has no real energy to it. Good film composers are pretty much non-existent these days, and this movie's no exception! Too bad, because a good film score definitely would have helped make ""Iron Man"" more fun and more exciting.*** SPOILERS START HERE! ***Okay, now to comment on plot points and stuff. I thought it was kind of weird to start with Tony getting hit and abducted in the beginning and then flashback 36 hours or whatever to see his life just before. Immediately, the movie's rhythm is knocked off kilter. Didn't understand that decision.Stark's escape from Afghanistan takes a while to come together. This once again goes into the whole Origin Story problem, where we're taking a lot of time getting to the adventure part of the movie.The following part with the whole corporate espionage stuff almost feels like ""Star Wars: Episode I"" did with all its political stuff. Also, the final confrontation between Iron Man and Iron Monger kind of felt like the ending of ""Fantastic Four"" with a battle confined to a city street at night. Kind of small scale for a big-budget movie like this.The film does have lots of good ideas. The problem is with the pacing and the energy. It just seems like things are kind of casual and Stark at times seems a bit laid back about what's going on. Even in his final line, ""I am Iron Man"" he seems a bit low key. C'mon Tony, say it loud and say it proud! The script and the direction just could use more snap and energy. I got the feeling that the screenwriters and director seem like they are working hard at getting the job done, and not enough time getting into the material and feeling it.*** END OF SPOILERS ***Overall, a good superhero movie. Now that the whole origin story is over, let's get to a straight adventure story and have some real fun with it!******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)","

"Iron Man","Aaron1375","13 May 2008","I revisited this film for the first time in a while and I have to say, that the Marvel universe really started off on the right foot. Sure, Spider-man had already had three huge blockbusters and the X-men were successful and the Hulk, well he was in a very artsy film; however, as far as films that were interconnected and leading to big things this would be the start. Granted, The Incredible Hulk would stumble a bit, though I enjoyed that one too. This one showed that a lesser known hero could take the center stage as back then he was known to us comic geeks, but not as widely known as heroes such as Spider-man, Superman, Batman or others. Now, nearly everyone knows about him and this is the film that kicked him off and put him on the right track. An origin film that gets quite a bit right as far as how Tony Stark became Iron Man in the comics. Very good action and the effects were good too as the Iron Man armor looks very good. I always enjoy seeing Iron Man in films now because his armor always looks totally cool to me.The story has Tony Stark demonstrating his latest weapon in the middle east. He designs weapons and his company is a major player in the military. Well the convoy he is in gets attacked and he is taken prisoner. He has shrapnel in his chest and it is heading to his hear; however, a doctor has placed a magnet in his chest to keep it out. The terrorist holding him, want him to make a missile, but he decides to do something else. So he designs a arc reactor in his chest and then designs a suit to make his escape in. Once home he decides to stop making weapons and instead focuses on designing a more state of the art suit so he can do some good in the world and be a protector rather than a destroyer. Unfortunately, a man who works at Stark Enterprises and is second in command as plans of his own to build a suit and for more militaristic purposes.The first thing they got right in this one was casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He does a great job and I have enjoyed seeing him portray the role again and again. Terrance Howard was Rhodey in this film and would have continued to be the character, but a salary dispute led him to leaving the role. He is okay, but now that Don Cheadle has been Rhodey in every film since this one it is a bit strange seeing Howard in the role now for me. Jeff Bridges does an okay job as the bad guy, but the suit he wears is a bit more awesome than he is as the main bad guy.The film was good as it started up the Marvel universe of films. Nowadays, the humor and action seen in the films stem from the start which is this film. You get to see the old school Iron Man suit and the more up to date one, though I do wish you got to see the fully operational suit a bit more as the last battle has Iron Man battling at less than full power. Still, the last fight in this one was a bit better than the final fights in the sequels. The film also ends in a bit of a humorous and unexpected way as opposed to what was the standard back in the day with the hero on a rooftop or standing sulkily on a ledge.","

"Iron Man","PWNYCNY","9 May 2008","Excuse me while I recover from the shock and amazement caused by my extreme surprise that this is an excellent movie. I expected the usual vacuous Hollywood hokum with the usual Hollywoodish heavy handed combination of outlandish special effects masking a superficial story and two-dimensional characters and instead was treated to an actual well-acted, well-crafted science fiction story with actual character development within the framework of an interesting plot. Robert Downey gives a marvelous, surprisingly powerful performance as a hugely wealthy, arrogant arms merchant who undergoes a major personality transformation - for the better. This movie is entertaining from start to finish and is worth watching.This movie is, for Hollywood, a rare combination of special effects extravaganza combined with a substantive story that actually has some dramatic content. This movie dramatizes the problems caused by industrial activity that gains profits through war and how special interests can completely drive and distort a country's foreign policy. That there are some in our society who reap huge profits off the suffering of others is a sad commentary, which is a theme of this movie. The Iron Man is representative of what happens when someone decides to take the high moral road. To survive, the main character has to literally wear a suit of hard metal to fend off the attacks from those whose profiteering schemes are now threatened.","

"Iron Man","mjplysaght","27 April 2017","Superhero films had become a bit lackluster around the time of this film's release. Of course, some would argue that superhero films are lackluster now, but after films like Spider-Man 3, some people had lost interest.Then Marvel had announced its own Cinematic Universe starting with Iron Man. This film has utterly transformed Robert Downey Jr's career, who at the time was considered a druggie burnout. This film marks his return to form, portraying Tony Stark, a self-proclaimed genius billionaire playboy philanthropist. The remarkable thing about his performance as Tony Stark is that it seems effortless. His confidence and charisma is ever-present as he goes through the film.Tony Stark, the successor to his father's business, Stark Industries has made his name selling innovative weapons. However, when he gets captured by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and learn that they have been using his weapons to terrorise cities, he has a change of heart and manufactures a miniaturized Arc Reactor to keep himself alive after sustaining life threatening injuries and also to power his latest invention, the Iron Man suit.His mentor and father's former partner Obidiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) strongly disapproves of the new direction Stark has made for the company and takes steps to remove him, in every sense of the word.Plot synopsis aside, let's actually review this sucker.The film has several strong points. For one, the character of Tony Stark exudes enough charm that you're always on his side. Sure, he's arrogant and conceited, but what's a character without flaws? Second, the special effects. For CGI that was made for a 2008 film, it still holds up. The MCU would continue to wow us with masterful effects so this was a great starting point. Also, the dialogue feels more natural as the characters are always talking over each other in conversation, as opposed to overly rehearsed and perfectly paced. It makes it seem a little more down to Earth, and yes, I'm aware that I'm making this point about a film in which a man flies around in a weaponized suit of armour.Overall, it's a very well made film and showed to us that superhero films can be really great.","

"Iron Man","PeterWorthers","7 May 2008","First off, I like Robert Downey Jr. He's a very versatile actor. Any role he is in is brilliant, (Heart and Souls being a favorite) and Iron Man is no exception. He delivers lines almost as if he were making them up as he went along. His playful banter with other characters and various machines and small bits of comedy make the film very enjoyable to watch, and the events surrounding his capture and the first half of the film hit too close to home, adding to the films realism. We get the small nods to the comic geeks (You know who you are, myself included) with a cameo by Stan ""the Man' and even Rhodes making a reference to a War Machine suit that could be in his future. Plus on a personal note, it was good to see the Air Force (of which I am a member) was all over this film, we haven't had this much screen time in a movie since Stargate and the Transformers. Plus we're the good guys again, its nice to see it again, I hate when we're the bad guys; but then again I AM partial. Plus, the Air Force knows when to step in and when to let Iron Man kick a bad guys ass. But I digress. This film is just what we needed to (1.) get the summer movie season off to a good start and (2.) restore our faith in Marvel comic movies. (Need I mention Ghost Rider, Elektra, Hulk,the Punisher, Blade:Trinity, Spiderman 3need I go on?) It is good to see we can go beyond the normal heroes like Batman and Superman to someone who has real depth as Stark does, not because hes a superhero but because he is a screwed up person with many, many flaws. In him we see ourselves, messed up, making constant mistakes but for some reason we want to do good and will try the best we can to make right our wrongs. I can't wait for the next one. Also, stay for a bit more movie after all the end credits are over with.","

"Iron Man","IQ42","23 November 2021","This was actually much better than I expected! Somehow, I never got around to seeing these Marvel movies (and reading the corresponding comics). Indeed, the first superhero movie I've seen was a Spiderman: Far from Home when I was in the US for an exchange semester.Iron Man was much better!The movie was never boring, had cool fight scenes and an interesting story line about how this suit came to be. At first I wasn't sure what to make of the middle east conflict being involved in this movie but I think it was actually incorporated pretty well and a reminder to the existence of terrorist groups and actual war in that part of the country, as well as the possible abuse of weapons.I think I'm becoming a superhero fan!","

"Iron Man","eamon-hennedy","19 July 2009","Yes, I know, the title to this review is a quote from Richard Donner's Superman The Movie, but there's a reason for that, and I am going to get to it, so bare with me.In a summer dominated by the darkness of, well, The Dark Knight, it may be hard to remember than a month of or two before it we were all basking in the universe of another comic book character, a multi millionaire, too, and, what a coincidence, a character who uses his quite considerable wealth to turn himself into a superhero. All similarities end there (don't worry comic book fans, this is not a review of compare and contrast proportions). For as The Dark Knight falls into a darker and darker pit of despair, terrorism metaphors and increasingly dark plot twists and even darker cliffhanger ending, Jon Favreau instead creates a world of blue skies, brightly coloured costumes (well, for the hero anyway), witty dialogue and, above all else, a lovely atmosphere of fun. Iron Man is, pure and simple, unadulterated fun, amazing when you consider that a good half hour of the film takes place in war torn Afghanistan, with the lead character in the hands of characters who are essentially terrorists. Of course, if the film was in other hands, this would lead to many a darker moment, probably using the comic book genre and lead character as a means to explore modern day warfare in the war on terror. Not Favreau. God bless Jon Favreau because what he chooses instead to do is have fun, lots of it.I have a confession to make. I didn't get to see this film until recently. At the time of writing I only watched the movie on DVD for the first time the night before. Another thing, I loved The Dark Knight. I levelled some mild criticism at its darkness, but loved the movie nevertheless, but here, we get something that is positively giddy, funny and very, very enjoyable. I can't believe I missed it on the big screen, because this is great, and as a sci-fi adventure/comic book adaptation, it's got everything that I love to see in a Hollywood blockbuster of this nature. Imaginative action, funny dialogue, humour whilst retaining an ability to keep the film serious so it can remain engaging and great acting. The latter is particularly impressive. I know it has been said by many elsewhere, but let it be said again, primarily because I want to say it, Robert Downey Jr is fantastic. If played right this should be a comeback of John Travolta/Pulp Fiction proportions. He was always an actor that I liked (please check out Hearts and Souls if you have a chance) and here he brings that cheeky, comedic quality he always has, but filters it through a wonderfully engaging heroic complex. Quite simply he plays Tony Stark in such a way that you want him to be a hero, you want him to make the right choices and by God you want him to save the day. There are no Christian Bale style brooding moments here. Tony Stark is a lot like the movie itself, it's a hell of a lot of fun.I still haven't mentioned Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges or Terrence Howard, but they all put in good work too, particularly Gwyneth, the will they/won't they chemistry between her and Robert is lovely and played almost in a 1940's screwball comedy way. Did I mention she is gorgeous throughout, not that it's important. She is though.And the final scene is brilliant. I want another one and I want it now.","

"Iron Man","Craig_McPherson","5 May 2008","I have to admit that Iron Man wasn't on my preferred reading list as a kid when comics made up a large part of my reading material. Superman, Batman, and the more obscure Tomahawk were my staples. So taking in John Favreau's rendition of Marvel's Iron Man allowed me the luxury of not bringing excess baggage to the screening. The result? Iron Man is a treat for the senses.Telling the story of billionaire military industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who during capture by Taliban-esquire guerrillas, develops both his tin man design and a clarity of vision causing him to see the evil of his company's ways, Iron Man unfolds with a style and flow that most movies can only envy.During filming Favreau allowed his principals free reign to improvise their own dialog. The result, along with some smart plot scripting by a quad of writers, is a film that has a natural, unscripted feel that lends it a natural, somewhat realistic feel.Rounded out by an impressive cast that includes Terrence Howard as Stark's military confidant Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as his long-suffering love interest, and Jeff Bridges (The Dude) as the movie's villain, Iron Man plays out very much in line with creator Stan Lee's original vision of Tony Stark patterned after genius billionaire playboy Howard Hughes. His vices of alcohol and women are there, but in muted form.Designed as the first installment of a trilogy, with all actors signed for the duration, the continuation is expected to further delve into Stark's alcoholism as well as the advent of Rhodes' morphing into War Machine, which is hinted at late in the film.Originally optioned by Universal with horror icon Stuart Gordon (Edmond) to direct, Iron Man bounced around studios and production houses ranging from 20th Century Fox through Paramount, with, at varying points, everyone from Quentin Tarantino and Joss Whedon, Smallville's Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, to Nicholas Cage and Tom Cruise having being penciled in for the production, the final culmination under Favreau and Downey is a movie that will enthrall viewers from the first frame to the last. So grab that bucket of popcorn and large drink, and sit back and enjoy.","

"Iron Man","popyoshi-36312","25 February 2023","A great origin story about an egotistical weapons dealer learning the effect of his actions and trying to change for the better, the story is really well told and very sweet but it is still relatively basic and is a simple origin story, the movies villain is also very boring and uninteresting with no real reason for being evil, that being said it is still a fun and enjoyable movie that is definitely one of mcus best and a great film to just watch with or without the mcus instalments. I recommend the film for anyone whose not seen a super hero movie before as it's a great introduction to the genre, and it's a great super hero film for people who are overly familiar with the genre.","

"Iron Man","Red_Flag","25 May 2008","There's no doubt Iron Man is an entertainment machine and a stunning one at that but it's a damn shame it takes so long and at so much expense to get there. Sure the pacing's not great and both the beginning and the end flitter with dodgy CGI and a underwhelming feel but there's no denying that the central parts of Iron man is the very best of marvel. It's lead man Robert Downey Jr. Who shines the most. He has just the right amount of dry Witt and charm to carry the film through even its patchiest moments.From Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures comes Iron Man, an action-packed take on the tale of wealthy philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who develops an invulnerable robotic suit to fight the throes of evil. In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, one of Stark's colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in Whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. Jon Favreau directs, with Marvel movie veterans Avi Arad and Kevin Feige producing. Paltrow provides some much needed flavour to the otherwise dry script and Terrance Howard adds to the humanity that is often forgotten in super-hero movies. Fortunately while Iron Man does deliver on the humanity level when needed it doesn't allow humanity and realism to bring down the overall fun of the film as it is in Spider-Man 3.Iron Man isn't perfect, it's riddled with ultimately forgivable flaws but flaws none the less. Flaws witch most of the world seems to be able to over look considering its high rating and a place on IMDb's Top #250. For some though the flaws are too huge to simply ignore. Most eyes remain of Downey Jr. Throughout the whole show and quite rightly so. He is charming, sophisticated and best of all very funny. Its clear he was the right choice for this role. The CGI is a tad strange, flitting from computer graphics reminiscent of the original spider-man all the way to last year's transformers, there often bad there mostly good.Not too light, not too dark a bit grey, then? Not at all: this is buoyant, bright, a constant breeze. But still it hovers somewhere on the superhero-adapt spectrum between the good and the great. Not as flyweight as Fantastic Four or Daredevil or Ghost Rider, but just missing the myth-spinning splendor and heft of a Spidey 2 or X2 or Batman Begins.","

"Iron Man","dfle3","30 May 2008","This is the brazilianth superhero movie to come out the US in the last picosecond. And it's not too bad, but, like with most of them, I doubt I will be as willing to see any subsequent sequels.In its favour is the performance of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man. The movie is basically boot-camp for people unfamiliar with the titular hero. In other words, you get the genesis of the character ""Iron Man"". Stark, as played by Bob Downey is smug, but fortunately comes with a dry sense of humour. Stark is a brazilianaire who inherited his fortune from his military industrialist father. Utilising his own scientific brilliance, Tony Stark has carried on in his father's footsteps and is now the supplier of choice for the US military.His Personal Assistant is Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Quirky name, but not in the same league as Pussy Galore, or Alotta Fagina. Paltrow provides her character with a degree of warmth...and coolth. She is reminiscent of some of Woody Allen's leading ladies at times, too, like Mia Farrow or Diane Keaton.Anyway, the story is basically about how Tony has a crisis of conscience after he gets a taste of his own medicine, arms wise, in the Middle East. Generic Middle Eastern terrorists are one of the main bad guys in this film.In a way this is an American fantasy about itself. In Hollywood movies like this, America plays the hero in the Middle East and Americans care a lot about not inflicting civilian casualties. This is ably demonstrated by Iron Man in one scene where the phrase ""surgical strike"" is not pure spin.A theme of this movie is the struggle between the individual conscience and that of society or bodies like the military/Pentagon. Stark has a foot in both camps and thus sometimes mud will stick where you least expect it to.As I was just about to leave the theatre, after the end credits, an extra scene appeared, hinting at the nature of the sequel. Dunno if I'll see it.7/10","

"Iron Man","KineticSeoul","3 December 2011","This isn't a awesome spectacular superhero movie, but it's still well crafted and entertaining. Iron Man is a Marvel superhero that stood out to me and in this, it gave me more interest in Iron Man and even Tony Stark the man behind the suit. Robert Downey Jr. really carried the movie in this as Tony Stark, the way he acted felt close to the comic book. Not exactly like the modern comics that has Iron Man in it but close enough. This is a origin of how Iron Man came to be and the build up of it all is nicely done. The build up is a long process but I wasn't necessarily bored by just watching how Tony Stark becomes the Iron Man. Jeff Bridges did a great job playing Obadiah Stane, he didn't have a lot to work with here. But when he was on the scene his presence was ominous and fit right in while also being intriguing to watch. I watched the movie ""Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room"" and he reminded me of the greedy and power hungry higher ups in a company. It's a shame his character wasn't developed all that well, but again this movie is about Tony Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow also did a good job of playing Pepper Potts, she did the perky and cute assistant thing well. The main flaw about this movie is that it just doesn't have enough Iron Man in it. I know the build up had to be a long process to show how it all happened in a short amount of time as possible but it would have been nice if it had like 2 or at least 1 more scene with Iron Man in action. Overall though this is a well crafted superhero movie that is a good blend of realistic and sci-fi that fits right into a comic book universe. It's a shame the next sequel won't be as good. But looking forward to ""The Avengers"" movie which is hinted at the end of the credits. This movie ended in a very good note as well and will leave the audiences excited.7.9/10","

"Iron Man","FlorisV","19 February 2017","One of the best superhero films, if not the best. After a second watch, I realized how good it was and how much better than so many others.Good and quirky dialog, never a dull moment, well dosed action scenes with enough suspense and sense of danger. Great fun. The characters' motivations are always clear and believability never went below the expected minimum. Action scenes are very well filmed, efficient and never with the usual cheap fast cuts. The villain simply works because it's someone seemingly much more powerful, plus a treacherous man you just love to hate. And our protagonist has much-needed weaknesses: he's only human, and a bomb shrapnel close to his heart.The film looks and sounds great overall. Every character, including Jarvis, adds value and has an important function for the story and the entire casting is just sublime, with Downey's star shining the brightest. He even manages to make you care about a selfish billionaire playboy before he transcends himself.I can't put this film down. It still serves as a benchmark for all other Marvel productions that have come out since and none have achieved it's level, though some have come very close (Winter Soldier). But I guess there's truly nothing like a good origins story! After 8 years, this film is still as awesome as ever.","

"Iron Man","erinandvictor","1 May 2008","This was a great movie. I am a huge Downey fan, but was really unsure about him playing a super hero especially a guy in his 40's. I can say that because I'm right there with him. He was amazing. I normally don't like these kinds of movies and wouldn't have gone to it if I hadn't known someone who was an extra, but I am so glad I did. Jeff Bridges was so good, I'm having a hard time with him being bald, but it was a good move. My only complaint, was Gwyenth Paltrow. She was horrible, it was like she was really trying to play the part, she half-you know. But other than that it was great. Special effects, whoa.Good job.","

"Iron Man","jaddison383","9 May 2008","All to often, superheros turn into geeky, rather dull characters when they get out from behind their various costumes. 'Iron Man', on the other hand, in a stroke of brilliance, makes it possible to love the man behind the metal mask even more than the hero itself. For the first time, we're not dealing with a dual personality here- Iron Man and Tony Stark (his true identity) are one fully realized character.Mr. Stark is the rich young owner of a huge weapons dealing company. While displaying his newest creation for the army, he is captured by terrorists who order him to build them a bomb of their own. It is in this place that he has a revelation and escapes with one purpose in mind: He must retrieve the weapons that he himself distributed.Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on perfect in the lead role. He somehow blends sarcasm and real caring into nearly every line. The result is someone we can laugh with, yet also genuinely care for. As Pepper Potts, Tony's longtime secretary/caretaker/love interest, Gwyneth Paltrow delivers the goods once again, playing both hard-to-get intelligent and still very girly. The relationship between the two leads plays wonderfully, never going into schmaltz or typical lovey-dovey-ness. Instead, their interest in each other is not hardly addressed up front, yet through great performances is made clear. Jeff Bridges adds his own flavor as Tony's business partner.Director Jon Favreau keeps the pace quick and the editing sharp, bringing the excitement to near boiling point at times. Yet he also shows an intelligent and graceful hand with the more plot-centered scenes, in particular the ones between Tony and Pepper. All in all, a fun and exciting way to start off the summer. Check this one out on the big screen while you can! Jay Addison","

"Iron Man","Robert_duder","21 May 2008","I definitely had my doubts about Iron Man. First of all I am not a big Marvel fan, always been a DC kid, and Marvel has been churning out stinkers including the less than stellar Spiderman 3, Daredevil, Hulk, Fantastic 4 and so forth. I had very, very low expectations for the film and then the reviews started coming in from professional critics and...they loved it? They raved about it and then people started talking about how great it was and I knew I had to see it and find out for myself. First of all I can say that Iron Man is absolutely captivating. Nothing I feared for the film pans out...I thought special effects would be over blown and cheesy and they weren't even close!! I thought the story would be too fantastical to translate to screen and they did it perfectly. I had no background on Iron Man, never read a comic but it seemed to me to be the last hero you'd want to try to make into a serious live action film but it seems to me that the film makers took very careful steps in bringing the character to life and hired a cast that was quite simply brilliant in every way. A really great ensemble, a well thought out story, good but not overblown special effects, and really kept true to their fans already existing.Robert Downey Jr. is being heralded for his performance as Billionaire arms dealer Tony Stark. He is excellent. He has a flare certainly for the sarcastic biting comedic wit. However that alone would have made him nothing more than a George Clooney as Batman fiasco but to my surprise he also made a terrific hero and leading man and really lights up the screen with his personality and performance. Terrence Howard who is a really terrific actor gets a supporting role without a lot of depth but given Howard's ability he makes a great pseudo sidekick to Downey Jr. performance. I think his character could have been given more but he does excellent. Jeff Bridges is just an amazing super villain. His story starts out on the low end and really turns him into the ultimate villain by the end with a very cool robotic fight at the end. He is just an excellent adversary and also extremely talented. Gwyneth Paltrow returns to the big budget screen as a sidekick to Tony Stark and somewhat of a love interest as Pepper Potts. Her role is toned down as well so as to not overshadow the main character but she is good opposite Downey Jr. and their chemistry is excellent. Throw in the obligatory appearance by co-creator and Marvel god Stan Lee (who I immediately recognized the first time) and a very small cameo role by director Jon Favreau and you've got an incredible cast together with a great story.As with all Superhero films we have to get the creation of the character and the unique thing about Iron Man is that the entire film nearly is Stark creating and perfecting this persona and then exacting revenge and saving the world from his own weapons. The story definitely leaves everything wide open to serialize (they've already announced a sequel) but can they possibly re-create the same great team and story that they did for this one. To me, who had very low expectations, I have to feel like this was a big successful fluke that all these pieces fell into place but maybe I'm being pessimistic. Regardless Iron Man starts off the summer blockbusters with a huge bang and you won't be disappointed in the story, the action, the characters, the actors or anything else about it. I just found myself completely enthralled by the story as fantastical as it seems, somehow they found a way to make it real and bring it to life without it looking stupid and I thought that would be their real challenge but I was wrong. Iron Man is absolutely astounding!!! 9/10","

"Iron Man","EijnarAmadeus","7 May 2008","IRON MAN is the latest superhero-movie in cinemas, and it's another round of man-turned-into-amazing-powerhouse with CGI, love interests, a full on CV-cover-up and mayhem. And this is the first Marvel-child that's fully financed by Marvel Studios, and being a blockbuster it's surprising how they've chosen such a bold casting and choice of director; surely, casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man is interesting even before you've seen the teaser, Gwyneth Paltrow as the smart and sexy assistant Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges villain Obadiah - and director Jon Favreau seemingly came out of nowhere.The film opens up with twinkling ice-cubes in whiskey, and soon the high-flying main character Tony Stark gets blown up by his own weapons as he gets locked-up for three months by Afghanan guerrillas to build a missile, instead he and his temporary sidekick makes Stark RoboCop 2: the Rusty & Deserted Sequel, as Stark shoots his way out of danger and returns to his glossy everyday - but now, as a changed man. The near-death experience kick-starts his goal for becoming Iron Man - but as soon as Stark adds the hot-red colors to his suit, the movie loses momentum; this is where Iron Man actually starts, so we're expecting something spectacular, but instead we get messy. Director Favreau is funky, and he knows how to squeeze every little drop of cool and swagger from Downey Jr., but as the action-bits starts coming, they're too brief and feels like a lackluster. IRON MAN's surely got potential, and the soul of the movie is surely in here, but a sequel that's right-on explosive is surely the right way to go from here.","

"Iron Man","angelynx-2","4 May 2008","For many months I had no hopes for, or interest in, this movie whatever, expecting just another explosion-loaded summer gadget-fest for the tech fanboys. When I heard the buzz on Downey's performance I decided to see it, but I still had no expectations in particular. Well, I got a surprise and then some, because this is one heck of a smart, funny, rockin' movie. It has huge kinetic energy, and stays on course throughout, never sinking into the trap of a long, dumb, drawn-out special-effects brawl (I'm looking at you, X-Men III); the Iron Man suit is a ***real suit*** from the wonderworks of Stan Winston, not CGI, thank heaven!; music choices are very cool (Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" and Suicidal Tendencies' ""Institutionalized"", yeah!); casting and acting are excellent (Gwyneth Paltrow gets high marks); and Downey's performance is simply a marvel--pun only half intended!--perfect from start to finish. From his fast-talking hyperactive demeanor and the edgy, nervous intelligence of his eyes to his expressive face and understated body language, he really IS Tony Stark, completely believable as a high-tech genius used to living on his mind and nerves (and alcohol) alone. (I'm guessing the buff physique is just something he cultivates to make sure he looks good in those expensive suits.) Playing Stark as a wired 21st century media star instead of the outdated stereotype of the suave high-living playboy is a brilliant stroke, and his crisis of conscience is completely convincing without being at all maudlin or overdone. --Downey's just great in this, and I publicly apologize for not having had any confidence in him, cos this could not have been played better.To top it off, it's even got a relevant and topical anti-military message, raises touchy subjects like American foreign policy and war profiteering, and has a surprise cameo after the credits (do not leave early!) that raises all sorts of speculations for the future. =)---Man, I had the best time at this movie. It's a complete kick, and much, MUCH better than I expected.","

"Iron Man","diac228","8 May 2008","To kick-start the 2008 blockbuster season is an enjoyable entertaining first look at Marvel's answer to DC's Batman. After years of begging, one of Marvel's more popular comic books appears on the big screen equipped with a stellar cast, massive budget, and drastic marketing campaign displaying how much more fun it is to follow the man in the metallic suit rather than the man in leather. Iron Man is a film that contains enough attitude and energy to intimidate other films of the same genre. Much like Batman Begins, Iron Man slowly but surely explains the origins of our hero and displays how and why he becomes the superhero that we all know. The only difference is Iron Man is simply a lot more fun and enjoyable to watch.The hero in this tale starts off a womanizing, sarcastic, selfish and carefree leader in a weapons manufacturing business. Tony Stark was trying to sell his latest greatest inventions overseas when suddenly he is kidnapped and is forced to manufacture weapons for the enemy. Right then and there he realizes that he's accidentally producing for the enemies as well as for the allies. Upon this revelation and being caught up in the middle of it, he crafts his greatest invention: which is a killing, nearly invincible machine full of ammunition and tricks. With a few major adjustments, this ultimate weapon becomes his new alter-ego, which is the heroic yet fearful Iron Man.Iron Man's biggest strength lies in the realism. Guess what, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is not a flawless hero, he has his moments of questionable decisions, lack of morals, and inability to see some of the dangers he creates. His secretary (Gwyneth Paltrow) is not a mere toy for our hero, nor does she settle for Stark and all his flaws. The lack of attempt to make the superhero seem perfect is definitely a breath of fresh air when compared to recent comic book movies. To add to that, Iron Man is not a mindless action movie full of explosions and carnage; most of the movie focuses on Tony Stark and his transformation from carefree millionaire to protector of the general public. Using a great script from Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, the movie is sprinkled with great one-liners, good dialogue, and very little slow-down and unimportant moments.Robert Downey Jr. does an absolutely stellar job as Tony Stark, and fits the role perfectly. Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Terence Howard do pretty well with the material they were presented, with the exception of one scene that wasn't supposed to be funny (Bridges can't yell). Complimenting the acting is the special effects, which never overpowers the actors nor does it overpower the scene. When Iron Man is fighting, the only thing you can do is sit back and enjoy the wild ride. The special effects weren't the greatest, but they certainly got the job done. Unfortulately, the final fight wasn't that great because we witnessed robotic carnage to the nth degree last year in Transformers. Topping Spielberg and Michael Bay is never easy in terms of action pieces.What keeps Iron Man from becoming a comic book movie with the top-notch quality of the best comic book movies (My personal favorite is Spider-Man 2) is the fact that the main character and alter ego need time for presentation and introduction to the audience. The potential in the Iron Man franchise is not only immense, but it basically spills into the screen at all times, especially in the final moment after the credits. Iron Man is the beginning of something potentially very special. Spider-Man 2 had the advantage of us knowing the man behind the suit, and got the pass to deliver two hours of intense, emotional, and excellent film-making. Iron Man 2 can be the next Spider-Man 2, as long as the same amount of dedication and effort is put into the project.Bottom Line: In the meantime, we have one heck of a flick here, as Iron Man dwells beyond the typical comic book flick and delivers a great start to the 2008 summer movie season. Great acting, excellent special effects, and more promise for the future of Iron Man should be enough reason for you to see this. Even if you don't know a lot about the comic book, the movie does a great job in presenting the man behind the iron mask in all his glory (and anti-hero glory). Recommend, as the beginning of a great franchise is offered here.P.S. Except a killer soundtrack here too.","

"Iron Man","dantheman0056","23 June 2008","Iron Man is truly one of the best comic book films out there. Robert Downy Jr. was a questionable choice to many to cast as Tony Stark. Rob has proved them wrong as RDJ's performance is the best part of this film. Tony Stark a cocky, full of himself, multimillionaire has made billions on selling weapons. But when a trip to the middle east goes wrong, Tony finds out just how "" good"" his weapons are doing to the world. Tony builds a suit of armor to escape capture and when he gets home vows to change himself and the company. What ensues is a vicious power struggle against Obidiah Stane ( Jeff bridges) and the creation of Iron Man. The special effects are very well done and believable. One complaint is that there isn't very much action, but there are several well done scenes. The supporting cast is very good especially Gwenyth Paltrow. The dialog is smart and funny. The reference to SHIELD and Samuel Jackson after the credits are very exciting. Although my favorite comic book movie still goes to Batman Begins, iron Man is a very good film.","

"Iron Man","azeemnavarro","26 August 2019","In a personal quest of giving the MCU a second chance to prove me that is not as awful as I think it is, I will rewatch every movie up to Endgame, so we have to start with Iron Man. And yeah this is exactly what I remembered it was: a fun superhero movie that actually knows what to do.
With Iron Man, Marvel found a formula that worked, and that unfortunately they have squeeze for 10 years that every ""origin"" movie they make is just a remake of Iron Man. And I get why they do this. Iron Man works because it plays safe. We get a simple history, the typical hero's journey, ad what better if the hero we're talking about is Iron Man. Who knew who Iron Man was back in 2008? Just comic book readers like me, if you asked people if they knew Iron Man, they would've probably ask if you we're talking about the Black Sabbath song. Robert Downey Jr., a faded star that had some very serious addiction problems (ironically, just like the character itself), was gifted to play Iron Man. The man was born to play Tony Stark, yeah he's a great actor, but if you think about him, this role will pop in your mind instantly. He does a wondeful job at playing the childish CEO that eventually transforms in the hero.
But enough praise for Downey Jr., there are other things to talk about. The rest of the casting does a great job, except for one color dude no one remembers. An unrecognizable Jeff Bridges is the villain, and while the character itself is weak and we don't get so much explanation at why he's bad, Bridges still does a good job. Gwyneth Paltrow was also perfect casted as Pepper, she is in every Iron Man film a great support character, and her relationship with Tony Stark here is charming.
Why everyone went to the cinema when this was released was part thankful to that red and yellow suit. I have to say that the CGI of this film back in the day was impresive, but it hasn't aged that well, especially at the fight at the end with the villain. Still, is not annoying or anything like that, but is quite distracting.
So yeah, I have to say that Iron Man, while flawed, was a perfect start for the MCU, that after this one, has released more than 20 movies, few of them reach the quality of this first instalment, but all that succes is thanks to a playboy we all love.","

"Iron Man","shiftyeyeddog","4 May 2008","Iron Man. Who'd have thought?Quite simply one of the best superhero flicks ever made, and a strong contender for the top spot. I honestly don't know if I can pinpoint a single flaw in the film, except that I wish it was even LONGER. Not only does it succeed as a comic book adaptation, it succeeds as just a great MOVIE. Probably the most fun flick I've seen in a good two years or more.So how did this movie get it right when so many others get it all wrong? It certainly isn't just the character. Iron Man is a second-tier Marvel character that never really caught my eye much or gained the general public's love. I believe it was two factors: casting and respect for the material.First and foremost, I can't imagine anyone but Robert Downey Jr. playing this role. He owns it so completely and is such a perfect fit that I have to wonder how much of the script was completely re-written for him or was improvised. His brand of humor and wit, along with his great range as an actor allow him to convey the whole arc of Tony Stark's story, and to make it entertaining every step of the way. I am especially impressed at the studio's decision to *gasp* actually cast an appropriate actor over 40 years old, rather than cast young just to bring in the teen box office.While so many other comic book flicks treat their material (and audiences) condescendingly, or just as a silly story that can be used to show off cool effects or action scenes, Iron Man instead respects that it can be just as good or respectable as any other film. Nothing is over-the-top or forced. The story is much more grounded in reality than most superhero genre films - There are no ""superpowers"", just technological genius and talent. It's taken to extreme degrees, for sure, but never feels far-fetched or silly. The film also shows you can include comedy without it being blatant comic relief, full of forced silliness and one-liners. No the laughter here is genuine, and lots of it. I laughed more in this film than I have in any actual comedy film in a long time.Recent superhero flicks like Batman Begins and Superman Returns were well-made, exciting, and dramatic, but lacked the fun factor. The overall tone of those films is so dour that repeated viewings are a bit of a chore. Then others like the Fantastic Four came out and went in the too far in the other direction, being cheesy and dumb. Iron Man got back to the tone of the first two Superman films and found the perfect balance of drama and comedy.I could go on about every aspect of the film - the supporting players, score, effects... but I'll just say it all clicked. The rest of the summer's flicks are going to have a lot to live up to. I suspect this is the movie people will go back and see again and again, as other summer fare fades away. Just plain fun.","

"Iron Man","dakotadickenson-83457","5 April 2023","Iron Man is a film that not only kicked off the start of the MCU that we know today, but it is also a film that launched Robert Downey Jr's comeback into Hollywood and made him the superstar that we know today. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark is phenomenal and I cannot imagine any other person I can imagine playing this character than him. Jeff Bridges as our first supervillain of the MCU Obadiah Stane was a perfect choice and great casting. Probably personally one of my favorite villains of the MCU. Terrance Howard as Rhodey I thought was great. I liked the chemistry him and Robert Downey Jr had. It is kind of a bummer that Terrance Howard gets recast in the second Iron Man, but honestly I cannot imagine anyone other than Don Cheadle nowadays playing the character. Other than that, Terrance Howard did a good job in this film. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is definitely as far as love interests goes in the MCU one of my favorites ever and is astonishing. Overall, Jon Favreau's take on the story of how Tony Stark became Iron Man is one of the best super hero origin story's to date and one that will live on for years to come. Rating 8/10.",NA
"Iron Man","fearfulofspiders","21 September 2008","First off, I didn't have high expectations for Iron Man, but for what I did have, all of them were surprisingly met. As a whole, it is a well done film, if not a little overrated. The acting is sometimes hammy, the special effects aren't all that impressive, and the pacing isn't exactly going to bode well with younger audience members.The acting is moderately good. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges steal the show with their roles, while Robert Downey, Jr. seemed less than impressive -- and, at times, bored as Tony Stark. Terrance Howard, once again, is dull both in performance and as in character.As far as visual effects go, Iron Man himself is pretty realistic, but as for the explosions and final battle it's not very detailed, nor impressive.Favreau's direction is pretty good, if not a little mediocre. I thought his inclusion as director seemed too big for him, as his only ""great"" film I can recall is Elf. A few of the flaws can be put on the screenwriter, primarily. The pacing of the film is pretty bad, even for an origin-story, it takes a long time for Stark to gain a conscience and become Iron Man. The villain is predictable, and the showdown at the ending is neither heroic, or enthralling.The music by Ramon Djawadi isn't very good, however, there's moments of real soar and sweep that make it worthy of a buy -- an example would be when Stark is making the prototype iron mask while prisoner.Overall, Iron Man isn't as good as the first two Spider-Man movies, and no where near classic status of the new Batman films, yet it is vastly superior to the majority of other superhero films, and I recommend it to families who have children that can comprehend why it takes so long for Tony Stark to become Iron Man.",NA
"Iron Man","winner55","2 August 2008","The plot is typical super hero movie; the superhero appears in three major scenes, with the bulk give over to the trials and tribulations of the 'secret identity' character. Pure formula, and not one I've ever had much admiration for. When I pay to see a movie about a superhero, I want to see the superhero, I don't care about the secret identity.The much touted special effects are really pretty much 'more of the same,' nothing special here.The action is fun, but the 'tech sequences drag.The big plus of the movie is Robert Downey Jr. He plays Stark with a truly sophisticated wit lacking in most of these films (Michael Keaton's original Batman might also be an exception).Okay matinée fun, but hardly a 'blockbuster.'",NA
"Iron Man","ExpendableMan","17 May 2008","Given that over the past eight years or so we've seen three X-Men movies, three Spiderman movies, two Fantastic Four movies, Batman, Superman and the Punisher, it's not hard to imagine a few people rolling their eyes as Iron Man, the latest superhero franchise turns up this Spring. Cast all those aspersions aside though folks, years from now people will be talking about the first time they saw Iron Man with the sense of wistful nostalgia usually reserved for the likes of Jaws. This is one of those movies that reminds you why you keep going to the cinema: pure escapist entertainment that for two hours provides the perfect break from Council tax, mortgage repayments and neighbours throwing four month old watermelon slices at your conservatory windows.The somewhat familiar story revolves around Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), a billionaire weapons dealer with a penchant for fast cars and loose women. His self-absorbed life comes to sudden end though when he gets captured by Afghan rebels after demonstrating his latest super missile, goodbye California Condo, hello dusty pit of hell. Tasked with building them a missile, Stark turns the tables on his captors by fashioning a formidable armoured suit Macguyver style out of their weapon supplies and smacking them into oblivion. A free man again, he returns to America and brings a burning desire to correct some of the wrongs he's helped to engineer with him. That and a massive great hole in his chest.From here the story follows typical superhero-origin archetypes but is still constantly watchable thanks to Downey Junior's charismatic performance. His Tony Stark is a walking charm offensive without any nauseating smarm (thank the lord Tom Cruise did not get it) and manages to exude chemistry out of everyone he comes into contact with. Nailing every single one-liner, it is abundantly clear why his GI bodyguards in the opening scene are so starstruck; if you're in this man's presence for more than a few seconds you will want to be him. Heck, even the anthropomorphic robots in his lab enjoy his company.Granted, by the time the first hour has gone by and our hero still hasn't put on his iconic red and yellow suit, some of the ankle biters might get a bit impatient but the payoff is well worth it. His brawls with the Afghan militia are eye-popping enough but his closing battle with the Iron Monger (think over-sized alter-ego) is the real clincher. It's a barnstorming highway smash 'em up which puts the ADD camera of Transformers to shame. Parents need not fear though, this is not violence, it's action. There is no blood to speak of and even the potentially harrowing scenes of villages being raided or young American soldiers getting machine gunned fail to put a downer on the colourful escapism.The film also boasts the strongest supporting cast since Batman Begins and they all do their best, but despite Terrence Howard's matey military liaison and Jeff Bridges oozing menace, this is still very much the lead's show. His star quality practically drips off the screen and combined with the outstanding set pieces, turns what could have been yet another production line origin movie into the best blockbuster of the year so far. And make sure you stay to the end of the credits, it's well worth it.",NA

"Iron Man","johnnyboyz","2 August 2009","The last time I saw a fictional superhero in a red and gold get-up flying through the air and generally trying its best to 'wow' and entertain a crowd, must've been in that 1996 Schwarzenegger Christmas comedy entitled Jingle All the Way. Thankfully, Iron Man is a little better but it additionally made me daydream about what it might've been like had Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.), the ever present lead in the film, ever stumbled across the two camp hit men from 1971's Diamond Are Forever, you know: the one's that flit around, killing people here and there while philosophising about certain ponderous subjects that come compete with quotes like: ""If God had intended man to fly, then he'd have given him wings."" Rather immediately, we can assume Tony Stark be the sort of man to think outside the proverbial box; he doesn't just want to fly, he wants to do it without the wings – bizarre, all-over-the-place-colour-scheme and all.For what it's worth, Iron Man isn't particularly that bad. It covers a tale, indeed a plight, of one small; relatively thin; harmless looking; eccentric even, and soft bodied man of whom represents something far larger, overpowering and powerful in Stark Enterprises, which is Tony's company that he's inherited from his father. Iron Man begins with one of those annoyingly quaint VT sequences, the sort that exists solely to inform us of what's going on; the sort that crams in years, sometimes decades, worth of predicament and event purely so that it can fast-track all the necessary back-log and get to this point in these person's lives. From just about here, it dives headfirst into Afghanistan and presents us with this rich, life loving and seemingly psychologically spotless hero as he merrily romps his way through the desert with the United States Army. Only, the convoy is attacked and Tony is taken captive.First and foremost, Stark is an arms dealer of sorts. He creates weapons so that others may use them for destructive and ill-advised purposes. When it transpires Stark is attacked by his own weapons, there is a moment of clarity that tells our lead that things must change; and that means risking loosing all the close-to-unwatchably-bad content/lifestyle just prior to him flying out to The Middle East. The cheery and sugary scenes of the pompous Stark milling about with reporters, women and extravagant events as he indulges in nights out at the casino and one night stands comes across as woefully inept but tactfully so; simultaneously providing us with a point of attack that gets across what Stark is like but also providing us with a certain wrong belief that is instilled within the lead, something that resembles a gung-ho, ""nuke 'em now"" policy that will change.Iron Man is competent enough, but I wonder if director Jon Favreau is fit for this sort of material. Stark's realisation of what it is he actually does and what it is he actually contributes to in the world feels underplayed, while his shooting of an Afghan cave system in which Stark is held hostage, and forced into building a weapon of mass destruction, looks less grotty; grimy; undesirable and unpleasant then it does a themed entrance to 'the underground zone' at a theme park complete with cheap, plastic cave walls and fake sand. There is a distinct, but uneven, feel to this segment of the film; an acceptance that this is what's being done, and this is the study being made; but a biting feeling that had the budget been halved and the picture looked less colourful and less polished, we might be feeling the pain with the lead a little more.It's in and around that prison cave system that Stark realises he won't be building any more weapons, so rather than do that, he stumbles across the idea of building a seemingly indestructible suit made of iron that, essentially and perhaps ironically, he will use in combat later on and thus render a weapon of sorts. I think a lot of Iron Man would like to be about the deployment of weapons to other nations by more powerful nations. Stark, being an American and being the head of an all powerful American organisation that ISN'T the government, and his actions recall the giving of Stinger Missile launchers to the Afghans to use against the invading Soviets during The Cold War, and how, in 2003; that news footage of a ground Afghan using a Stinger Missile launcher against an American plane rather eerily comes back to tarnish that decision. By the end of the film, Stark hasn't perfected a weapon as much as he has modernised a suit of some sort that aids in the attempting of ridding the world of those that mis-use these weapons.But slightly interesting study aside, the film is not without reservations. The audaciously named Pepper Potts is played in agonising; not unwatchable, but close, fashion by Gwyneth Paltrow; while a lot, and I mean a lot, of time is reserved for the development of the iron suit which itself involves testing, tests failing and a lot of dumb slapstick humour. The typically British, and-thus-intelligent, computer in Jarvis (Bettany) is a nonsense inclusion as is the manner in which one such Afghan sacrifices himself in order to aid Stark in his getting out of a predicament, which is a little off key. The film may be a large, loud and somewhat dumb at times production, but it's aiming for that in the first place. The fact it has a degree of substance running just below it, calling into question one's morals amongst a few other things, helps elevate the film slightly but it's underwhelming and quite daft in the long run.",NA
"Iron Man","laraemeadows","1 May 2008","A genesis story, Iron Man answers the question, ""Where did Iron Man come from?"" Laughter dots the super hero backdrop that is visually fun to watch but lacks the lift off to be a classic super hero movie.Like the wise one says, ""necessity is the mother of invention"" and Tony Stark's mother birthed the crude chrysalis of Iron Man in a cave in Afghanistan. While demonstrating the Jericho Missile, spoiled, womanizing, arrogant weapons manufacturer and brilliant engineer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr. ) is kidnapped by the Ten Rings terrorist group led by Raza (Faran Tahir). He is seriously injured during the attack. They hold him captive with a kidnapped doctor, Yinsen (Shaun Toub), who saves him from further death by attaching a device to his chest. Yisen and Tony work together to escape alive. Instead of recreating the missile for the terrorists, Tony develops the beginnings of Iron Man, emotionally and mechanically.Iron Man is studded with easily recognizable names camping it up for the story. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Tony Stark's assistant Pepper Potts. She runs around in four inch heels, maternally tending to Tony's needs. Her dialogue is fun but a little grating at times because she is a deep as a teaspoon. Terrence Howard plays Jim Rhodes, Tony's friend in the Air Force. He puffs his chest in ways that would make a Marine commercial blush.Iron Man isn't a huge modernized Rock-em Sock-em Robots revision, nor is it a strict superhero movie. It deals with the very beginning of the Iron Man legacy, so it is more Tony's personal development story. He begins as a self absorbed, uncaring, skirt chasing billionaire dilettante with no regard for the consequences of how his money is made. By the end he is a self absorbed, skirt chasing billionaire dilettante who cares about the people around him, where his money comes from and what people do with his weapons.There is no shortage of scenes meant to make you laugh that add nearly nothing to the plot of Iron Man, including one with stripper flight attendants. The scenes meant to evoke laughter sometimes force the audience into an uncomfortable giggle, like a chuckle one might give their unfunny uncle. It isn't all middle aged relatives; some of the laughter was well earned. His machines are fun, his mistakes are entertaining and his arrogance earned more than a few smiles.The scenes where Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man are exhilarating. I found myself clapping for flame throwers; how often do you get to do that in real life? I was fond especially of the learning scenes where Tony was trying to perfect Iron Man's suit.The computer generation of the suit is flawless. I did not have to set aside belief because the light was wrong or the shine was too perfect. The only problem I had with the Iron Man suit was the inside of the mask, which seems like it is the size of a space suit when the camera looks in it at Tony. If one was to judge the size of the entire suit as it relates to the space in the mask, one would think it was designed for a couples naked high-altitude romp.I found Iron Man enjoyable but, unfortunately, my socks remained firmly on my feet. I couldn't really escape into it but I didn't mind watching it either.",NA
"Iron Man","SebMoz","11 November 2020","As the first movie to come out in the MCU, it's obviously an important movie to get right. A good movie creates interest, which a franchise needs a lot of to stay relevant. And luckily for Marvel, this movie is everything one could want in a superhero film. It's perfectly paced, it's captivating and it's funny. Most of the characters and performances are great, with RDJ and Jeff Bridges being my personal favorites. The action is well-filmed and edited, the production design is great, the music choices are good, almost everything in this movie is fantastic. My only small issue is that the villain is pretty forgettable and almost comical at times, like so many other Marvel villains, even though Bridges play him very well. The final battle also feels a little anti-climactic, but it works alright. Overall, this movie is still really good, it's one of the better movies in the MCU, and most definietly a good start for the franchise.",NA
"Iron Man","NightmareOnElmStreetFan","6 July 2019","Iron Man (2008) is American Marvel Superhero Action film and the best one in the trilogy. It is my favorite best superhero film of all time that I love to death!!!
It has a great story great origin story about Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) how he become armored avenger ""Iron Man"". The movie has high-flying action sequence and super speed. Iron Man was build and not born. Excellent performance by Robert Downey Jr. as playboy billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man. The first movie in the trilogy is the best one it is my favorite MCU film it is also intelligent and interesting. How from an selfish, arrogant prick turns in to a good heart person who want to do the right thing to protect innocent and destroy the weapons his designed that fall in to terrorists hands.It begins in Afghanistan on a tour Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is captured by an enemy terrorist and is forced with Yinsen (Shaun Toub) is forced by terrorist known as ""Ten Rings"" to build in a cave Jericho missile who designed for American military that is his price for a freedom but Tony knows they want let him free so instead he builds an powered armor suit in their escape. But his friend Yinsen during the escape dies. In a battle of fire fight Tony Escapes and try's to destroy the rest of weapons. After returning home Tony Stark industrialist shut's down the factory of weapons and starts building high-tech suit of armor red and yellow color and vows to protect the world from treats as ""Iron man"". Tony finds out that he was betrayed by his friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who hired Tony's hit and Obadiah was the one who was selling weapons to the terrorist group. Iron Man must not only to protect our world he has to fight Iron Mongler on the end of the film in a suit that is Obadiah Stane. He goes back in to Afghanistan and destroys all his weapons and he defends the weakest people. He also has a blue heart in the chest because the shrapnel hits him.The film has great direction from Jon Favreau who also plays Happy Hogan Tony Stark's personal bodyguard. The music score for the first Iron Man is excellent from Ramin Djawadi who also made an excellent music for Prison Break TV Series. Great performance from Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts Tony's secretary and assistant I enjoy her performance. Terrence Howard is great and likeable as James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes he was better as Don Cheadle. Paul Bettany as JARVIS voice was excellent I love hearing JARVIS advices to Tony. Jeff Bridges was super fantastic bad-guy as Obadiah Stane/Iron Mongler.Great action film and great action sequences watch in which Iron Man battles Iron Mongler best epic sequences ever. I am been a fan of Iron Man my whole life after seeing him in animated series and animated movies. I was such a huge fan of this movie that I want it to buy in the store DVD but I found only animated movie not this movie. After this film was released I become so excited about seen this film and I never expect how good it would turn too. Everyone from the cast at acting did an excellent 100% of them. It is an 10 year anniversary since this action masterpiece come out. Yes I am calling it a masterpiece cause I love it so much.The writing work so well with the actors with their roles. There's a lot of development into the writing and made relate to the comics. But of course the main that people loved this film is Robert Downey Jr. He killed it as Tony Stark and Iron Man. I couldn't see any other actor to take the role. He brings so much development and emotions into Tony and make you relate to him real easy.This movie get's 10 a perfect score is my favorite origin MARVEL superhero movie of all time the best one in the trilogy. From the special effects of the design. You have soundtrack AC/DC in this film ""Back In Black"" and Iron Man by Black Sabbath which I love those songs to death.The film isn't praised only for CGI, action sequences and acting it is praised for AC/DC soundtrack. The band is so popular that director Jon Favreau hired the band AC/DC for the sequel Iron Man 2.",NA
"Iron Man","Special-K88","3 May 2008","Downey brings the perfect blend of strength, smarts, and humor to the role of Tony Stark, a flip and wealthy industrialist who's made a name for himself by following in the footsteps of his late father and producing high-tech weaponry without assuming any responsibility. A near-fatal accident in the Afghan desert leaves him with an artificial heart, and for the first time allows him to see the repercussions of his business endeavors. A changed man, he decides to pull the plug on weapons marketing and surreptitiously builds a state-of-the-art iron suit that gives him the capability to combat rebel militia groups who've acquired his technology under the table...but unfortunately that's easier said than done. Marvel Comics adaptation is less fanciful than most of its predecessors but certainly true to the genre, well-cast with intriguing (and believable) characters, spectacular action/effects sequences, and an engaging hero, the only thing it lacks is a human story compelling enough to sustain its length. ***",NA
"Iron Man","freemantle_uk","7 May 2008","I have just been to seen Iron Man and I liked it. Iron Man is based on the the Marvel comic and is there first film they have done by themselves.Iron Man starts with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was in Afghanistan to show his company's latest weapon, the Jericho, which was a missile that could fire miniature missiles. However, Stark gets captured by a terrorist group the Ten Rings. In the attack he is badly injured and a capture surgeon using a car battery an electrical-magnet to prevent metal from getting to his heart. However, instead of building a missile Stark makes his own Iron Man suit and uses the electrical-magnet to power it. After escaping from the terrorist camp he is saved by American troops and is returned to America. It was then that he declared that Stark Industries would stop selling weapons and many people within the company and the media worry thinking that Stark had lost his mind. After this Stark refines his design for the Iron Man suit and learns that his friend and business partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), was secretly selling terrorist Stark industry weapons. One the Iron Man suit was refined he goes off to Afghanistan to do battle with the terrorist and test it out. The terrorists also discover the original iron man suit and end up giving Stane it and he uses it to develop his own suit to become Iron Monger. At the end of the film Iron Man and Iron Monger do battle at Stark Industries and Iron Man becomes known to the world.Iron Man is harder to make into a realist film to other superhero films but it works. What the writers and director do is set Iron Man in the near future with technology being very important to the world. Jon Favreau also updates the film from Stark getting captured in Vietnam going to China to being captured in Afghanistan. Iron is also more humorous then other comic book adaptations, but it works for Iron Man. Favreau also has a good cast to work with, Downey was good as Tony Stark and he will possibly develop the character from a billionaire playboy to someone more darker. Gwyneth Paltrow was good as Pepper Potts and had good chemistry with Downey. Terrence Howard was casted with the sequel in mind and become War Machine. Finally there was Jeff Bridges, an actor I like played the villain. Finally their were cameos from a number of people, including Jon Favreau as Stark's bodyguard, John Crammer as himself, Stan Lee and last but not less Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury at the end of the film. The special effects were impressive and needed because there was no other way of it being done. The action was great, especially the fight between as Iron Man and Iron Monger.However, this film does have problems. It was made with sequels in mind and at time was predictable. However, it still a fun film.",NA
"Iron Man","prietoheitor","26 February 2021","Memorable for his first appearance as Tony Stark / Iron-Man of Robert Downey Jr. but, impressive for his well-told story, captivating characters of skillful intelligence with a deep vision full of scenes of frantic action. ""Iron Man started what would become Marvel in a new era of intriguing and exciting bloclkbusters for the audience!!",NA
"Iron Man","TheUnseenMovieLover","4 May 2008","Iron Man is an example of when expectations slowly started to sneak up on me, until my excitement towards the film had reached an incredible point. Let me tell you right from the off. Even with my high expectations, I was blown away by this movie. Excuse the pun, but Iron Man is a marvel of a blockbuster.There are so many accolades that I want to give this movie. It is one of the best kick-offs to the summer movie season ever. It is one of the best, if not the best comic book movies since Spider-Man 2. It is one of the best comic book movies ever made. And finally, it packs one of the best casts for a comic book movie ever.I'll start with Robert Downey Jr., who gives an absolutely phenomenal performance in the lead role of weapons manufacturer Tony Stark AKA Iron Man. Downey Jr. not only develops a deliciously likable, intelligent and hilarious individual with aplomb, but he also does a tremendous job at delving into the character and revealing his guilt over how he has destroyed many people's lives, and his determination to right the wrongs that he has committed. In Downey's hands, this is a shockingly electric portrayal, one of the most compelling and human performances ever in the role of a superhero and easily one of the best, if not the best performances of the year so far.The incredible supporting cast also deliver fantastic performances. As Obadiah Stane, Stark's business partner, Jeff Bridges manages to do the near-impossible; he manages to counter Downey's exceptional performance with one which is almost just as impressive. Taking the character by the horns, Bridges crafts a truly menacing and imposing individual. The power of Bridge's portrayal is all the more notable because he refuses to chew the scenery, which makes Stane all the more deadly. He is truly a terrific adversary. As ""Rhodey"", Stark's military liaison and friend, Terrence Howard brings charm and charisma to his role, and also makes his character one to watch in future instalments with one killer line. And finally, Gwyneth Paltrow oozes sexiness, intelligence and sophisticated emotions as Stark's assistant and possible love interest, Pepper Potts. In a role which has given otherwise perfect superhero films such as Batman Begins a thorn in their side, Paltrow and the filmmakers have crafted a truly lovable, authentic and memorable love interest for their superhero. Impressive performances are also given by Shaun Toub as a prisoner of terrorists in Afghanistan and Faran Tahir as the terrorist leader.The direction and screenplay are also two other reasons why this movie is so compellingly brilliant. There is no doubt that Jon Favreau is a talented director (see Elf and Zathura for evidence), but I wasn't exactly surprised when many people reacted nervously when it was announced that he was to direct Iron Man. Fortunately, he acquits himself excellently. Favreau delivers a blockbuster that strives to be more than just your normal action feast, and that always hits the mark. Favreau's direction is heartfelt, engaging, fun and smart. He ensures that those who have never heard of Iron Man are sucked into the film's brilliant story right from the beginning, and directs the cheer-inducing action sequences with tremendous energy and panache. But where he really succeeds is in the quieter, more character-based moments, which transform the characters into living, breathing individuals.He is aided by a thoroughly superb script, which mixes intelligence, rip-roaring humour and crackling dialogue into one glorious whole. None of the characters feel like cardboard cut-outs. They are complex and interesting, but their sophistication never affects the action which many people want to see.Visually, Iron Man is flawless. None of the visual effects feel over-the-top or forced, and their perfect implementation into their environment makes them all the more realistic. Also, Iron Man uses its visuals much more subtly than other blockbusters, such as in the hysterically funny moment where Stark first tests his flying boots. This is a movie where the visuals are being beautifully used in order to make the movie's story have a stronger and more profound impact. They are also a terrific tool when it comes to crafting the movie's fantastic action sequences. From Stark's explosive escape from terrorists to the final climactic clash between Iron Man and Stane's alter ego Iron Monger, the action is fast, gripping, expertly crafted and utterly sensational, much like the film as a whole.There is also a unbeatable display of gadgetry on display here. The final Iron Man suit is absolutely flawless in its creation and layout, and is truly iconic, whereas Stark's robotic assistants (robotic arms and a computerised butler) provide some terrific moments of humour when Downey Jr. is around to be brilliantly sarcastic and energetic. Also, the soundtrack is excellent, with several great songs flawlessly mixed in with Ramin Djawadi's pitch-perfect score. All of Iron Man's terrific assets combine to make the best movie of the year thus far, one which is quite close to flawless in terms of entertainment. With a stunner of a leading performance, a top-notch supporting cast, terrific direction, an intelligent and hilarious screenplay and stunning visuals and action sequences, Iron Man is a powerful knock-out punch of a movie. If you haven't been to see any movies at the cinema so far this year, I implore you to go and be astounded by this. Also, be sure to stay all the way through until the end of the credits, for one mouth-watering final scene. Comic book spectacle doesn't come any better than this. The ball is in your court, Mr. Hulk. I look forward to seeing how you are going to top this.",NA
"Iron Man","musicacien","25 April 2009","I cannot complain about their first hour, Jon Favreau next to an inspired Robert Downey Jr. they adapt the origin of the superhero very well alternating the spectacular effects with an incomparable sense of humor. However it is deflated a little at the end when the plot becomes serious and he/she plays to conclude with the infaltable it fights final. It is almost the same case that the first delivery of Spiderman where the mejorcito happened when the hero didn't dress the suit. Robert Downey Jr, their character builds to the perfection, I cannot imagine a more appropriate actor to interpret Tony Stark. The rest of the allotment is very correct although to Terrence he lacked Howard a little more than presence (that am sure it will be compensated in his more than probable sequel). That more Stan's cameo Lee and the music of AC/DC and Black Sabbath ends up transforming it into one of the best adaptations that the Marvel has carried out (and the fans already needed it after “Spidey 3” and “Ghost Rider”).",NA
"Iron Man","tburke85","9 May 2009","When I went to see Iron Man I wasn't expecting much but this film surpassed my expectations thanks to a knock out the park performance by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. In tradition of ""Batman Begins"" this movie tells the story of how billionaire industrialist and genius inventor Tony Stark becomes the high tech armored superhero Iron Man. Downey Jr. delivers a great performance and he owns the role from his very first scene just as Christian Bale did as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins and the late Heath Ledger did as Batman's arch nemesis the Joker in the sequel The Dark Knight. He's perfect for the role of Stark making you believe a man like him could really exist. The rest of the cast also turn in terrific performances including Terrence Howard as Tony's best friend Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane and later Iron's Man nemesis known as Iron Monger, and Gwenyth Paltrow as Tony's loyal assistant Pepper Potts. The film may be a bit light on action but what it does have is character development plus lots of humor, drama, some suspense, and thrills. The action sequences are well choreographed and most of them happen toward the second half of the film. The special effects are fantastic especially when Tony puts on the suit and becomes Iron Man. Jon Favreau the director and actor did a great job of bringing the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man to the big screen. The battle between Iron Man and Iron Monger at the end did feel a bit anti-climatic and a bit rushed but fortunately the good more than outweighs the films tiny flaws. Because other then that Iron Man was definitely much better than I thought it would be and now I'm looking forward to see what they have in stored for the sequel. If you haven't seen Iron Man yet then go see it. You'll be glad you did.",NA
"Iron Man","blackberrybabe","2 May 2008","I am not ashamed to admit it: I love Robert Downey Jr. If you read my other reviews, most of them are about him. I cannot get enough of this gifted actor. He was the reason I wanted to see this movie.Director Jon Favreau does a great job with this film. The special effects are out-of-this-world. The music rocks. The dialogue is witty & humorous. The suit rocks. And the actors shine.Gwyneth Paltrow is Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's assistant. Not a Paltrow fan, but she suits this role. I loved her hair color. She is perfect in her conflicting emotions. And absolutely gorgeous in the blue ball gown. Perfect.Terance Howard surprised me. I have not seen him before, but I am a fan. As Rhodes, Stark's best friend, Howard brings a realness to the character. You cheer him on as he hints towards a sequel.The villain is played by Jeff Bridges. Amazing. I absolutely hated him. Knowing that he wanted to kill Tony when Tony trusted him made me cheer for Iron Man even more. I suspected him from the beginning. A great job by a great actor.This movie, however, belongs to Downey. He is perfect as Tony Stark. Talk about hot!! Not only is Downey good-looking in this film, but the shots of his bare, muscular arms sent a tingle through me. And his tight jeans sent more. The best good-looking shot of him is in the tuxedo. I melted into a puddle. Besides his looks, Downey makes Stark human. He can change emotions at the drop of a hat. Watch his eyes: he can tell a story just using them. I've said it before, I'll say it again: he has the best eyes in the business.The sexual tension between Potts & Stark steams up the screen! You can see how much Tony wants her, & how much she wants to tell him she loves him. I really wanted them to get together. Hopefully in the sequel.This is definitely the big blockbuster of 2008. I cannot wait to add it to my collection. Be sure to see it. Also, be sure to stick around through the credits for a surprise at the end.",NA
"Iron Man","Newsense","10 December 2008","The thing that makes Iron Man great is that nobody expected to be great. I mean people were skeptical because Robert Downey Jr. hadn't been a lead role for a decade so it was questioned if he would fare well or not. After seeing this movie , we all can agree that Robert Downey Jr not only was perfect for the role of Tony Starks, he also gave the man personality.Brief spoilers: Tony Starks gets into a near fatal accident in a Middle Eastern country and is forced to build a weapon for some militia group there. He builds his first Iron Man suit(which looks like the Iron Giant) and escapes from the terrorist group's clutches. He is found lying in the desert and returns home to say that he is through making weapons comes as a shock to everybody. Meanwhile there is something fishy going on with his longtime partner Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges).Opinion: Robert Downey Jr is great as Tony Starks. Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect as his assistant Pepper Potts and even though I had Michael Jai White in mind as Rhodes, Terrence Howard does just fine as the Colonel. Jeff Bridges is in top form as Obadiah Stane. I like how they took time to show how Tony Starks tested his armor out before he decided to finally use it. I also like the fact that the movie sticks to the comic book without being cartoonish and silly. Iron Man was the first superhero movie to come out in 2008 and it unexpectedly set the bar high for superhero movies in 2008. Two thumbs all the way up.",NA
"Iron Man","jefsof-2","22 May 2008","Not terrible, but almost. Robert Downey Jr. got a nice payday from this and he did what he could for the lead character of Tony Stark, but let's face it, John Favreau basically makes kids' films - and that's what Iron Man is - a movie for the 8-12 set.It's not even worth wasting too many words on this executive-notes-cut-and-paste formulaic piece of mass-market dreck.Suffice it to say too much time is spent on the backstory of how Tony Stark becomes Iron Man; there is the now standard betrayer/arch-villain antagonist (Jeff Bridges slumming); and the ditzy love-interest assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow doing, well, what she does).This is a kids movie, but even at age 10 I would've only given this film 4 out of 10 stars.And the fact that this is a critical as well as commercial success - and is rated over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, and over 8 stars here on IMDb bespeaks of just how low standards have fallen.

"Iron Man","jon.h.ochiai","10 May 2008","""Iron Man"" is great. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing. I was completely surprised by Director Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"". ""Iron Man"" never struck me as the most compelling superhero, after all his powers derived from the high tech metal suit. Despite the army of screenwritersMark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, ""Iron Man"" evokes spectacular visual excitement and a great character arc. Downey at the beginning is so out there as hysterically arrogant billionaire CEO Tony Stark, who asks at a demonstration of his latest Stark Industries weapon, ""Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both?"" In dramatic transformation as hero, Downey later poignantly confesses to Pepper Potts (beautiful Gwenyth Paltrow), ""I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right."" Robert Downey Jr. has always been his generation's most talented actor. It is gratifying to see him back, recovered, and at the peak of his powers.Yes, ""Iron Man"" is perhaps the coolest cutting edge technology display. However, it is Downey's masterfully balance of comedic and dramatic power that amazes. He is also supported by great actorsOscar winners and nominees. Terrance Howard plays Col. Jim Rhodes, who is Tony Stark's Government liaison, is smart and quietly solid. Gwenyth Paltrow plays to her strength in her light comedic romantic role. She is brilliant and charmingly goofy as Stark's loyal assistant Pepper Potts. Jeff Bridges is the charismatic dark force of Obadiah Stane, Stark's partner at Stark Industries, whose true intentions are murky. All this and watching Iron Man jet super sonic in the heavens makes this one the year's best and coolest movies.Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is boy genius from M.I.T., who is now CEO of his late father's Stark Industries. Stark Industries is the world's largest Defense Contractor, and Stark himself is anointed the ""Merchant of Death"". His father's partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges) remains Tony's business partner and confidant. In a weapons demonstration trip gone amok in Afghanistan, Stark is mortally wounded, and held hostage by ""freedom fighters"". Along with fellow prisoner Yinsen (strong and endearing Shaun Toub), Stark rigs an ingenious power generator for his damaged heart that keeps him alive. At the same time, he creates the prototype ""Iron Man"" to affect his escape. This forever alters and transforms Stark, who now honors the words of Yinsen, ""Don't waste your life."" Returning back home Stark announces to the world, while eating a cheeseburger, that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons of mass destruction, much to the chagrin of Obadiah. Stark secretly develops the ""Iron Man"" suit for himself at his ostentatiously high tech Malibu estate. Stark comically and intensely works on the crimson and gold ""Iron Man"" amidst his Audi sports cars and cool cyber toys. Downey looks great bulked up, and artistically executes physical comedy genius. Here Paltrow brings her best. Her Pepper feigns disinterest in Stark, but her unquestioned loyalty hints at her true feelings. Downey as Stark also plays brilliant and aloof, who finally gets a clue about making a difference in life and Pepper. They are so amazing and funny together. Bridges as Obadiah emerges as the visceral threat. Of course ""Iron Man"" veers into darker conspiracy, and the battle of good against great evil. Director Favreau orchestrates the CGI battle with pathos and style. ""Iron Man"" at its best is visually breathtaking.""Iron Man"" is one the year's best movies and Robert Downey Jr. returns with a spectacularly multidimensional and powerful performance. What Downey does is not conventionally acknowledged with awards, though it really warrants it. The special effects particularly the Iron Man rendering is so cool. ""Iron Man"" has a strong story and great actors. See ""Iron Man"".",NA

Iron Man is that movie.No ""I'm an alienated superhero with feelings"" here, folks, Tony Stark is a contrary jerk and he knows it. He also doesn't care, doesn't have to care, and relishes not caring, which is why once he finds something to actually care about, that is, making sure that the technology he developed changes it's nature from weapon to tool, it's without a second guess or any real desire to be quiet and indiscreet about it. This is a nice refreshment after the last couple of years, where even cheery and almost always dependably sappy Superman has to become an emo kid in order to make serious comic book fans wet. Taking some of the riffs of Ozzy's ""Iron Man"" and turning them into a decent metal score, ""Iron Man"" the movie is mostly concerned with showcasing the awesomeness of a man who has the ability, the means, and especially, the cash to kick butt on his own motivation. No long discussions about the nature of vigilantism, no fear of keeping a secret identity, no real basic questions except, ""How do I get those thrusters to work without killing myself? I want to fly."" I'm not intending to use this review to give The Dark Knight a short shrift, but where Dark Knight finally succeeded at making a realistic, emotionally felt comic book movie that people have been aspiring to ever since X-men showed it was possible, Iron Man significantly shows that you can have superheroes just be superheroes, which has gotten a little lost in the grind (and the few cases where people have tried making a mindless superhero movie in the past few years have succeeded at making them quite mindless). Stark has weaknesses, he has doubts, but damn it, he also never slows down to think about them. It's about time something like this came back.That said, in the case of Iron Man 2? Eh, probably not gonna be all that great.--PolarisDiB",NA
"Iron Man","dead47548","2 May 2008","Outside of Batman Begins, it's my favorite superhero movie and Downey Jr. gives my favorite performance in said genre. He took his normal hilarious personality and charisma, which works incredibly well for the character, and added touches of internal angst in the struggle of trying to make right for all the wrongs he has committed in his life. It works well as a character study of this complex man, and as a massively entertaining blockbuster. One of the most entertaining films I've seen in quite a while, and Downey Jr. kills once again. The action sours high, the characters are rich and the entire ensemble gives good support to the man of the hour. It really is Downey's film; nobody could capture this essence so perfectly and I don't think there's an actor around who I enjoy performing more than him. It's ridiculous that he actually had to fight for this role, because he is just too perfect. I'd go into more detail, but you get the picture.",NA
