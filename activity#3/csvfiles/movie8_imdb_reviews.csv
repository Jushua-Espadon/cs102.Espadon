"Captain Marvel","logancrane-71337","15 February 2021","This movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. It's a good film, and a good one to come out before her appearance in Endgame. The acting was decent, I can't say it was bad, because it wasn't. Samuel L. Jackson is amazing as always, as is Ben Mendelsohn, 2 of my favourite actors. This film is good. Don't listen to the critics saying it's terrible","

"Captain Marvel","Leofwine_draca","24 February 2020","CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff.","

"Captain Marvel","morrison-dylan-fan","22 March 2019","Travelling to Birmingham to get Easter presents for friends and family,I decided that whilst in the city I would go catch a film. Visiting the oldest working cinema in the UK (The Electric) I found a flick with a run time that would give me just enough time to catch the train home,so I get set to see the new captain of the MCU.View on the film:Whilst facially de-aged with seamless CGI,Samuel (yel)L. Jackson swaggers with a coolness that has not aged one bit, with Jackson hitting Fury's comedic punch-lines with a smooth as silk ease. The first woman superhero in the Disney Marvel films to have her own solo movie, Brie Larson brings out the heroic in Marvel's passion to save the Skrulls, but fails to fly to a super height in the comedic,and establishment of her own origins,as Larson delivers punch lines with a stilted awkwardness which allows Jackson (who has worked with Larson three times) to outshine her in the jokes, and Larson also keeps a cold distance from giving Marvel the enthusiasm other superheros have when using their powers.Designed as a origin for Captain Marvel, the writers visibly show more interest in the side characters than they do in lead, with the plight of the Skrulls bringing a heart and urgency to the mission, which drifts away in the mid-section that focuses on Marvel's dry beginnings. Dipping into the Dr Strange-style fantastical with a striking sequence of Marvel fighting her inner turmoil, co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are joined by cinematographer Ben Davis in largely skipping over the enticing fantastical (save for a cute cat) to deliver slick Marvel Comics action set-pieces and Star Wars-inspired space ship races, wrapped in a catchy 90's soundtrack leaving No Doubt on Captain Marvel's powers.","

a bit bad in other marvel movies, but it was still a movie that locked the audience on the screen and I think the subject is much better than the other marvel movies I would say above average for this movie.
It was just bad that captain marvel was so strong and couldn't show this power literally,but I guess this movie is probably the sequel marvel was just a single film project although the film makes a good money","

"Captain Marvel","panagiotis1993","4 April 2023","Live Reaction / Review for Captain Marvel (2019): I've been avoiding watching this movie for many years because I was sure its bad, but today I will watch it and decide if it is actually decent or not, I hope it is. I don't know anything about the character so this is all new for me. If I understand correctly she is not exactly (fully) human but Kree. The Kree have an enemy race called ''Skrulls'', ok that's an interesting concept already. The Kree seem to be like very very technologically advanced compared to humans. The Skrulls are shapeshifters which sucks if you are their enemy. Imagine having an enemy who could look like anything they want. I read that this movie takes place in 1995? So that makes it one of the ''oldest'' MCU movies I think. That's a nice change. So by accident Carol ends up on earth, I like that. Samuel Jackson looks so young, nice vfx. The first half hour is very decent. Oh boy this movie just reminded me how old computers were, huge and very slow. I like her suit, its a simple design but works.Bruh, she stole this dudes bike? Damn hahaha. I like the Carol/Fury team up I got to admit, i think they have good chemistry as a team. Ok the first hour is good but it got a bit slow, the pacing, still good though. I don't know how much sense it makes but the way she got her powers looks really cool. Wait so the Skrulls are not the evil ones after all? This just got a bit more intereresting. In the avengers movie Carol seems to be a cold, emotionless almost person. But in this movie that's not the case, she is friendly, likeable and has also some decent jokes and sense of humor. Her updated costume looks cooler than the previous one. The cat is so cute. Calling the cat Flerken and thinking its a threat is kinda funny, whats up with that? What the hell is wrong with this cat? Is it actually a monster? So the Kree (or some of them) were the villains after all. I like how it connects to the Avengers movies in the post-credit scene. Ok, this movie while it's not a masterpiece, its very decent. Decent plot, cinematography, some good jokes, no cringe moments, good performances, pacing and action.A fun movie overall and worth watching. I think it gets much more hate than it deserves. Definitely better than Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Thor: Love and Thunder. My rating is 7.5/10.","

"Captain Marvel","phd_travel","9 March 2019","The screenplay is convoluted and confusing. The beginning feels like you walked into a movie half way. When things start to get explained it's too late. The humor is unfunny and childish. Samuel L Jackson singing and playing with the cat. The story is so confusing and silly - bouncing around between Earth and the space ships and shifting shapes. Then the good guys are the bad guys.Miscast is the word to describe the cast. Brie and Annette are so out of place - they belong in dramas and rom coms not action movies.A black hole in the Marvel Universe.","

"Captain Marvel","gangstah_vino","6 March 2019","I don't want to adress the hate, but let's try to forget it for a second and just appreciate the film for what it is: a film. thank you.First of all, the intro of the mcu logo was great. youll see what i mean when you see the film and I appreciate the creators for doing it as they did.Now... first the good stuff:
1. Samuel L. Jackson: He played a more softened Nick Fury, but very much ""agent coulson prior avengers"" like, with a lot of attitude, sarcastic humor and less serious. Also the de-aging is becoming so good, that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked. His character was very well done on script and screen.2. Some of the action: The space battle stuff etc. was very well done. the special effects team did an amazing job at this movie. nothing felt or looked fake. kudos!3. Surprise surprise: the story. From the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting. The way they introduce her past was very originally done. The way she remembers things through different ways was clever.. very clever even, because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through.. it added to the story while adding to her character. Also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while.4. Ben Mendelson: really impressive job. very layered surpringsly and stand out in my books. the acting is general was very goodthe bad:1. It misses spectacle... and a standout moment. in thor 3 for example; you had the intro scene, and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thor's powers. i feel you didnt get that in this movie.2. Like I said the story was great, the execution a.k.a. the screenplay/script lacked... they had such great storypoints, but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion. the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real. she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit, since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like; ""but you didnt deserve that yet..."" Ben's character had a more emotional impact on me than carol... yikes!! (and i dont mean that in a killmonger-t'challa kind of way)3. some of the action again: some action just wasn't good. there is a moment she is fighting the skrull(the moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer) and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed... which is weird, because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed.All in all, the film was good. nothing more and nothing less. i missed an emotional attachment to the main character. I felt like i still didnt know her after the film, and i think that's because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film. she was supposed to be a bit arrogant, but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the STRONGEST creature in the world and they made me believe that btw. she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film. believe me! Wonderwoman's vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol, and basically made her less relatable.so that's why i gave it a 7. it's definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided. especially the way she got her powers(hihihi geeks out). Go see it. it is nowhere near as bad as iron man 2/thor 2, but it doesn't touch civil war, infinity war etc. either, its like rifght in the middle. inbetween those 20+ films.","

The plot twists were great, the Message behind it is even better. Samuel L jackson on his own deserves a solid 7, I have no idea why it was getting so much hate. sure , brie larson isnt the perfect fit like rdj is iron man. but she's not horrible either. the movie was 2 hours long and it didnt feel like it, It had Adequate humor and emotions.

"Captain Marvel","malomar12","8 March 2019","I'm really not sure what the young male audience was expecting for this movie that p**sed them off so much they had to write these nasty reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed Brie Larson's take as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Maybe they were expecting cleavage?She was given a limited storyline to work with and ran with it. At least this story kept me awake after I fell asleep several times during Black Panther. Samuel L. Jackson was up to the task of playing a younger version of Fury but the CGI of Coulsen left a lot to be desired and I'm guessing many of the Coulsen scenes were left on the cutting room floor.My biggest gripe was the music. I do remember the 90's as kind of a black hole for music in general, but there was some good stuff and NONE of it made into this movie.","

"Captain Marvel","EnoVarma","6 March 2019","I was left with the general feeling, that ""Captain Marvel"" is a major disappointment.First of all, there is a good story here somewhere, but it's just not well told, and there's too much of it crammed within about 115 minutes. The movie is fast-paced, but never really works, because the pacing is flat and timing is off. Aesthetically, ""Captain Marvel"" has been processed through the same ""Marvel filter"" as the rest of them. Dull. The filmmakers (indie directors of the great ""Half Nelson"") have given absolutely no attention to the music: the score is completely forgettable as are the 90's songs.As for the themes, the MGTOW people are going to have a field day with ""Captain Marvel's"" less than subtle ""feminist agenda"". I'm putting that in quotations, because it's more accurately described as simply female agenda. Which is absolutely fine and commendable; the problem is the infantile in-your-face way the filmmakers address the theme. The movie is set in the year 1995, and it really feels made for that year's audience. ""Captain Marvel"" lacks a fresh perspective. And, by the way, any fans of ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"" will immediately recognise one pivotal scene lifted from a truly powerful scene in the series finale. In any case, Carol Danvers of the comics was always a decidedly feminist character, so this shouldn't cause any waves. What's lacking, is Carol's wide array of problems: her character history in the comics is one of the craziest in the Marvel universe (which is saying something.). Movie's much simpler.The biggest disappointment, however, is the resourceful Brie Larson. She's just off. I don't know what happened, but the brilliant actress from ""Room"" is nowhere to be seen. She was just the wrong choice, I guess. Still, I'm surprised by her lackluster-ness. The cast isn't great, anyways, but at least Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn seem to be having fun.Unlike me, for the most part.","

"Captain Marvel","vithiet","18 March 2019","So I was hoping this would be a great movie and I could write a review telling misogynists to shut up because it's fantastic to have a strong female superhero as a lead character. Alas, in that regard Wonder Woman did a lot better as a movie as a whole.The acting is not that great between Brie Larson's poor performance and the prosthetic/GCI on Samuel L. Jackson that makes him look younger but also gives him an expressionless wooden appearance. There are very obvious plot holes (like, wait, how did they know to do that?) and the pacing is very uneven; there are a few parts during which I didn't feel engaged at all.On the plus side it does fairly well as an origin story, and there is that Marvel level of polish in special effects and editing. All in all, it might be a necessary introduction to Captain Marvel for Avengers End Game, but it is probably the weakest MCU movie to date.EDIT: 2 years later and I watched it a second time as part of my MCU chronological order marathon, and it is actually better than I originally felt. A lot of the above points still stand but I was a bit harsh because it didn't meet my expectations at the time. I now change my original 6/10 to a 7/10 as it's a fairly entertaining movie and is truly an essential part of the MCU saga leading to Endgame.","

"Captain Marvel","BrokenBeats94","9 March 2019","I feel Captain Marvel had a lot of pressure being an origin movie at the heels of Avengers Endgame, which is less than a month away!However I'm glad to say Captain Marvel is a decent origin story but don't expect anything on the level of Guardians / Thor Ragnarok / Infinity War.The film has a rocky start - a fear of lack of personality and a plot structure that throws you off at first. The film's development definitely got better as the film progressed which definitely stops it falling short.For MCU fans - we got a lot of Nick Fury in this movie which is awesome because it definitely adds a lot of fun to this movie and the de-ageing CGI is impressive.The feminist stance isn't too heavy-handed within the film, though absolutely commendable in a relatable way. On the other hand, I'd probably say Wonder Woman is a better female led superhero movie.I watched this movie in 3D and the 3D visuals in this movie are not particularly good - scenes were too dark on top of the 3D tint (this maybe theater dependent but I do work at a cinema).Plot wise, it's not an essential watch but definitely a solid standalone entry and had a nice lead in to Endgame. I look forward to seeing other directors working with her character!7.5 / light 8 out of 10","

"Captain Marvel","ygor_lacerda","11 March 2019","Ok, I've created very high expectations for this movie specially after Infinity War and since the very first trailer but they were a little bit shaked after checking the first reviews here...Really, 5.8!? What da hell!?!? OMG!Anyway, I went to the very release date to watch it already quite sad, trying to erase all those high expectations I' created... just in case...I'm following up MCU since the very beginning and it was hard for me to believe that on the merge of a new era for the MCU they would screw it (mind my words)...Well, after watching the movie for the first time I've realized that I should never disregard the high expectations I've created! That's not the best MCU, of course not but it's not bad at all, it really doesn't deserve any grade below 7!Those who have reviewed it with low grade should bear in mind that it's a movie that focus in the creation of a character. I wonder if these people have being following the whole MCU from the very beginning... there's no way to create a movie that focus in the creation of a new character without exploring the character like they did in this movie.Brie Larson is brilliant in this role, yes she is awesome, funny, bad ass, beautiful not to mention Samuel and Clark, I consider it one of the best performances for Samuel in the MCU and btw, what a fantastic CGI work for Fury and Coulson, awesome!The script is quite nice, maybe Marvel's just failed in not depicting the Krees role in the previous movies but the M.A.O.S. does it pretty well.There's a lot of action as expected, drama, fun (Goose masters it!lol), all ingredients a good movie needs.Looking forward to what is going to happen in End Game.Do not take in an account what others think, go and watch it for yourself and then decide if it's a good movie or not, for me it is, I've already watched it twice and would watch it again for sure!Enjoy it!","

"Captain Marvel","dagallop","15 August 2019","Wow! Marvel + good story line. I thought it wasn't possible but they did it, they actually provided the viewing public a movie that has a good story line.No taking the credit from the makeup artists as well as the CGI people, no Marvel movie would be worthy of even a fleeting glance without them, but in this movie they excelled. Sam Jackson looks like he could be a teenager. Great work. Additionally he is probably the best actor in the entire Avengers bunch, well was, Brie Larson does a phenomenal job, up against the likes of Jude Law she demonstrates that an epoch in the industry isn't required to be convincing.Back to the story line; it works! Sadly, this may be the first Marvel offering that not only has a fair story but doesn't get so convoluted it becomes a distraction. It also fills in quite a few blanks along the way.I never hold comic book type movies in very high esteem but this would be the exception. It is just a pity that the Marvel folks may force Brie to work with some of the other pathetic characters that bore my socks off!Synopsis: a good family movie with some great CGI, good acting and a nice story line.","

The story of Carol Danvers' self-discovery unfolds unconventionally, but ultimately its convoluted elements coalesce and the newly mature character who emerges in the finale is probably the most badass figure in the MCU.

"Captain Marvel","scb_coldsteel","8 March 2019","So I just saw Captain Marvel at the theater. I did my best to ignore the insane amount of false moral rage surrounding the movie on the internet so I could walk in with a less biased perception. Overall I'm glad I gave this movie the chance it deserved. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it certainly was an entertaining origin story that further added to the Marvel cinematic universe.The basic plot of the movie acts both as an origin story for Captain Marvel and also a tie-in for the upcoming Avengers film. Acting as an origin film the movie checks all of the necessary boxes. It mixed elements of an intergalactic space drama, traditional super hero fare, and provided some great throwback references to the comics. I won't go into any details because I don't want spoil the plot, but overall it was a fun and action packed origin story.Of course at this point Disney has these films down to a science. As expected the movie seamlessly blends drama, action, comedy, and references to the larger Marvel Universe. It's a fun formula that really doesn't disappoint on a superficial blockbuster level. Once the film finds its groove it is hard not to smile at the mix of action and humor.I also have to mention how well the film captured the time period. Any 90s baby will get a kick out of the many cultural artifacts from that era. I literally want to watch the movie again just to catch so many of the references. Plus the movie loving paid tribute to Stan Lee. It may have brought a tear to my eye seeing him on the big screen again.The movie was pure eye candy. The graphics were absolutely phenomenal and brought Captain Marvel's cosmic level powers to life. Seeing her at full power really should remind the audience why she is one of the most powerful Avengers. All of the action is sure to entertain pretty much everyone.I didn't see any problems with the acting at all. Brie Larson is a phenomenal actress and she brought a nice combination of levity and badass attitude to the role. Of course what is not to love about seeing Samuel Jackson as a young Nick Fury?If you went simply off the online user metrics your would think this was a terrible film. It was far from bad, but it certainly had its issues. Pacing was a major issue as the second arc of the film really slowed down the progression of the film. I also felt like the movie never provided a big enough conflict to showcase Captain Marvel's power scale and artificially blunted her powers through most of the movie with a plot device. Of course that's the issue with introducing an overpowered character by Captain Marvel just to tie into fighting Thanos for a future film. Plot wise there were also a few events that were a tad bit too convenient and really weakened the overarching story.Captain Marvel hardly reinvents the wheel as a superhero film. It firmly follows the establish Disney formula and acts largely as an excuse to have Captain Marvel act as a MacGuffin for the Infinity War conflict. Still Captain Marvel was a very fun film. Ignore the hate online from internet trolls who love to play their false moral outrage at every turn. The movie wasn't perfect, but it delivered exactly what I expect from a Disney Marvel film at this point. A 8.25 out of 10.","

"Captain Marvel","chandean-69762","17 February 2021","Let's be honest, we all only watch this for Goose.Captain Marvel really doesn't deserve all the hate it gets. Brie Larson overall goes a good job with Captain Marvel, she's not the best don't get me wrong, she has her ups and downs with her performances for sure. But I feel that she captures the attitude and structure of the character nicely.
Action is good, visuals are great, score is meh but still decent, sometimes the CGi can look off but overall it's what you expect from a Marvel movie, and the deaging for the characters like Sam Jackson's Nick Fury and Clark Greggs Coulson is actually super impressive and never took me out of the film.
Overall just a fun Marvel movie that feels extremely comic book-y and is probably exactly what you'd expect if you've watched most of the Marvel movies thus far.","

It was non stop action after action! Why do i read bad reviews? Maybe these reviewers followed the comic book before watching...but to me, this is new. In my opinion, this movie is better than Black Panther, by miles! Go watch it!","

"Captain Marvel","jeremycorbyn","31 May 2019","This film had great special effects, dialogue and acting, I think those three things contribute to 90% of how good a film is, the other 10% is of course the relatively meaningless characters and story. This film had a lovely female actress playing the main character, this film truly did showcase the HUGE potential a female actress and female character can have on a film. I feel because of this film's success it is also one step closer to getting 50% screentime for women on average on all films and TV shows. The special effects left me swooning and they felt out of this world, overall I think it was the right thing for Disney to decide to change Captain Marvel's gender. I loved this film and I recommend it to everyone.","

Yes, they changed certain things, like Mar-Vell being a female Kree scientist, rather than being the male OG Captain Marvel, and Carol joining Starforce, but it works. Yes, it starts really slow, but it's about Carol finding out who she really is and just how powerful she can be.The all-star cast is what makes it great. Who thought that Jude Law could play a really good villain? And it wad good to see familiar faces (Clark Gregg and Samuel L. Jackson) again.I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it's a great movie and it's definitely the right way to hype every superhero fan up for Avengers End Game. Solid 9.5/10 (9/10)","

Finally a marvel movie without some kind of focus on two people having some kind of will they/won't they relationship. (Steve and peggy, Tony and pepper, black widow and every other male, etc) The only relationship the movie focuses on is Carol's relationship with herself... finding out who she really is. It's a great movie with a great message: women can be their own heroes. SLJ and Brie have great chemistry and are absolutely hilarious. I recommend this movie. It gave me GOTG vibes.... loved it so much.","

Also I need more of the main character. I feel like In a lot of scenes Fury or Taolos is running the movie and not her.Now for the things I liked. The origin story is amazing and I love that she got one. She is amazing and needed one dearly and finally Marvel gave her one. Overall a good movie just needed some work in a few spots.","

"Captain Marvel","FrenchEddieFelson","13 March 2019","First of all, Brie Larson is one of my favorite young actresses, with Room and Short Term 12 for instance. So, I could not miss a Marvel with Brie Larson. In addition, the special effects are rather well done, and the film is funny (especially the danger detector that would not work according to Nick Fury). But it lacks a I-do-not-know-too-what in order to make it an excellent movie. In particular, the film is insufficiently pedagogic about the capabilities of the main character: in exactly 7 minutes (timed and verified at second viewing), we elliptically switch from a woman who does karate, manually warms a kettle and is able to send energy flows from her fists, without really knowing why or how, to a woman whose power seems limitless, on a scale we have never seen before in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. In a few weeks, within Avengers 4, she will be one character among too many others super heroes, while we barely know her. I wanted more about her. I still want more!","

"Captain Marvel","jamiedarlow-37510","26 March 2020","Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) is trained up to use her new mysterious power to its full potential by the Kree after being found by them. When escaping from another alien group, she returns to Earth and discovers there's much more to her past and origins than initially thought. Marvel Studios have absolutely got it in the bag and have done for a long time; setting a high benchmark with Infinity War in 2018 and just flawlessly pulling off action spectacle and superhero integrity in everything they do. Admittedly through the first half of this one, I did find it strangely slow burning and not as engaging as previous episodes despite the spectacle and heart that was clearly being poured into it. Nevertheless, I started gradually feeling it more as it progressed and I came out of it feeling energetic and happy! I think the humour and soundtrack had a lot to do with my involvement in the film; it's hilarious at times (Goose the cat is one hell of a creation!) and the music references from Carol wearing Nine Inch Nails and Pixies shirts to the song choices being perfect, made for really brilliant sequences. The film has a lot of substance underneath its surface which I felt more in the final half which has moments of epic beauty and the realisation of Captain Marvel's beginnings is stunning. I'd like to watch the film again and discover more from the early stages too (other than the beautifully incredible opening paying tribute to Stan!) which I may have missed. Performance wise the ever reliable and amazing Brie Larson delivers totally and brings another fresh and exciting character to the MCU. This is Nick Fury's finest hour on screen also as Sam L Jackson is fantastic as always! Filmmaking duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson, It's Kind Of A Funny Story) inject a unique style into the film particularly in the Earth sequences which are full of laughs; it's a promising and enriching start to Carol Denvers' story","

She is a female hero who has ideals, refuses to admit defeat, and is tough. I really appreciate this heroic, powerful, rebellious and uncompromising spirit, and I really like this version of Captain Marvel.The atmosphere is excellent, and the image of the female superhero is well established. Unlike the unrealistic beauty of Wonder Woman, the captain of the surprise gives a warrior's steel hard feeling, and the overall viewing effect is good!

Some claim the acting or the character development. Please... She has the greatest strength, just like in the comics.

"Captain Marvel","mochteam","13 July 2019","I heard mostly complaints about the movie because of a statement that Brie Larsen never even made. The film got attacked because people chose to believe a lie someone created. It always pays to do your own research before jumping on the band wagon folks.Captain Marvel obviously is the Wonder Woman of the MCU. I've been into comics especially the Marvel ones for a long time. Captain Marvel was a guy at the time but even still he was a pretty bland one that got mixed in with all the rest. Changing him over to a female did make the character much interesting. There aren't that many super - super powered characters in the MCU aside from the Phoenix.In the comics there's a lot of powerful women but for some reason in Hollywood there's not. I just don't know what it really is about Hollywood and Comic adaptions when it comes to women and minority comic book characters. ""Storm"" for example is just as popular as Wolverine as a fan favorite but in the movies her character barely serves any purpose. There was also ""Psylocke"" another fan favorite female character with a reduced role that barely made them important. I just never understood the disconnect of Hollywood with Comicbook fans when it comes to certain characters.Out of all the MCU movies they're of course just male leads. Black Panther and Captain Marvel were the only movies that broke the mold. Captain Marvel certainly being the only Female lead super hero movie I can think of (and no I won't even acknowledge that Dark Phoenix nonsense). I can't get upset with the ""girl power"" theme when I've been watching male super hero movies for the past 30 years of my life.I was actually grateful when Wonder Woman came out because I've been a long time fan of her and it was long overdue for her movie. Captain Marvel though is a wild card. She's not really a popular comic character and doesn't have huge fan base like Wonder Woman had. So this movie starts from scratch. As an origin story I found it as charming as I did all the other movies. It was different and the character of Captain Marvel was unique. I didn't get a ""Bat Woman"" vibe from the movie. I actually got more of a Metroid Samus Aryan vibe. The first parts of the movie were a bit rough as you try to figure out what's going on and so much is thrown at you but it catches up mid way and starts to make more sense. I feel like it would get better with a second movie now that Captain Marvel is established and they can actually focus on a story where as in this film they identified the Villains.I didn't find it to be a bad movie probably on par with the original Iron Man that wasn't as exciting as the other movies became either. Time will tell though if these gets better with the later additions.","

"Captain Marvel","thepriceofpayne","8 March 2019","I believe Screen Junkies put it best, this is a Phase One Movie in a Phase Three world. This is the first marvel film in a while that felt that the direction was faceless. Where the Russo's, Waititi, Gunn, Coogler, and even Reed (Among Others) shined Fleck and Boden's direction felt fairly faceless as the film comes off as just another Marvel outing. However it's not without it's charm. The visuals are stellar to look at, and the makeup on the fan-favorite Skrulls is a sight for sore eyes. The performances by Jackson and Mendelssohn are fantastic, but the movie wouldn't be anything without its leading lady. Brie Larson turns is a fine performance and it's great to see this character finally integrated into the MCU, however she's given very little to work with, and there's not much that truly distinguishes her yet, that's not the fault of Larson, just a writing and direction problem. The film is a fine spectacle, and a nice solo venture, but there's just not much originality that we've seen with the past slate of Marvel films.","

"Captain Marvel","grantpaulsen","6 March 2019","This is a very controversial Marvel film. Which seems to be a running trend with Disney films recently. The hype around this film seems to be very mixed, some want it to succeed and some want it to fail, and both sides seem to have these viewpoints due to various political reasons. There seems to be a lot of agendas involved. I do not have any stake in either side because I do not care about this kind of thing when it comes to film. I don't think it's fair to judge films from that perspective in a positive or negative way. In the same sense that I don't think it's fair to judge a film from a positive or negative perspective based on whether or not you like the actors involved. I don't care if films succeed or fail financially. Film is an art form to me and I just want to see films that are well-made by people who have a lot of passion for their craft.
To start with things I liked, there's some spurts of entertainment that come from this film. Some fun action scenes, the chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson was very on point. The de-aging effects for Samuel Jackson and Clark Gregg were surprisingly great. The first act overall was relatively enjoyable, especially the opening action scene. The music/score was pretty good. And the cat was a fun addition. But overall the film was very bland and disappointing.
Honestly, I was hoping for better. To me a superhero movie needs to have an interesting story, well developed characters, and it needs to grab me and make me care about what's going on. This applies to film in general. One of the saddest things about this film that I was genuinely hoping I wouldn't have to say is that I don't think Brie Larson did a good job in this film. Brie Larson is an incredibly talented actress so I don't necessarily think she's to blame for that, it might have just been the poor material she was given to work with. As the film progresses she gets increasingly more stoic, and the film never showcases any emotion or vulnerability towards the character for some reason. And her character is given almost all backstory with too much exposition and very little depth. And at the same time there isn't enough given to make you care about her or any of the characters. Overall I don't think she fit the character, the performance was very wooden and uneven. Which is sad to say because you can tell how much passion she's giving towards this character.
The narrative is so scattered that she kind of gets lost in the shuffle & they forget to develop her character. Which was disappointing for me. The storytelling was very messy. This film is trying to be an origin story, a connecting piece to the past as well as to what's going on now, and a set up film for what's to come later. So the film kind of collapsed in on itself because it's trying to do too many things at once.
This honestly felt like Phase 1, which is not a good thing. That's not to say that Iron Man and The Avengers weren't good, it's just that this film feels a lot like the early Marvel films in the sense that it felt like they were still in an experimental phase. They were still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't work about their films. They've passed that point and they know what works by now so this film as well as all the other new ones should be progressive steps forward, and this film was definitely a gigantic step backwards.
They also don't do a good job making this character feel important or relevant to what's currently going on in the MCU. We're told she's the most powerful character in the MCU, but they never show us that or make us feel that way. The film is a lot of telling rather than showing. Needless to say the writing and directing were pretty lackluster. Also the action other than the opening was not very good or memorable at all.
The Skrulls were fun villains, and relatively unique compared to other Marvel villains, but they weren't really given any character.
There was a lot of fun 90s references but I think the film relies on this as a crutch way too much. Which caused the tone to be very disjointed. They have 90s nostalgia for a little bit, then it feels like a buddy cop film with Nick Fury, and then it's a story about the friendship between her and Lashana Lynch's character. And there's no effort given to make the audience feel emotionally invested in any of these stories. And since it's always jumping back and forth between these contrasting tones, and that made the film uneven as a result.
There are some needless explanations for things that happen in the MCU and when they happened it felt corny and forced.
The film was a fun time but this is the 21st Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so at this point generic fun action films are old and tired. And since there have been dozens of Marvel films at this point they need to live up to a higher standard. So in order for me to like their films at this point they have to do something more than just making a fun movie. I can't believe I'm saying this but DC did it better. Wonder Woman had charm, charisma, and character development. And I Captain Marvel definitely fell flat in this regard. Again, there are moments of potential here, but they are hiding under the bland cliched Marvel formula. It's a very generic film that we've seen many times before not just when it comes to superhero movies, and I was hoping for more than that. 5/10.
Please see the film though and make up your own opinion on it. Don't listen to what others say, don't give in to online agendas no matter what side they're on. Just go see the film, make up your own mind, and when you do be honest about it, because that's how we get better films, by letting the filmmakers know what works and what doesn't work about their films.
But at the end of the day the fact that this film didn't live up to its potential doesn't matter, and I'm still very excited because...

"Captain Marvel","johnc2141","13 July 2019","Ok I had recently seen Captain Marvel kind of late like from redbox. Missed it at the theater. I really enjoyed it a lot. I like Brie Larson I think she is very good in the role.I was confused because I thought captain Marvel was a DC character so they renamed it Shazam. Which I didn't see but back in the 40s they had a serial called Capt Marvel aka shazam. Anyway this is a great MCU movie and the post credit scenes there is 2 by the way. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Finally get to learn how he lost an eye. No spoilers but it's a lot of great special effects and Capt Marvel proves to be a superhero to be reckoned with as she battles aliens. Also in the cast is Jude Law and Anette Benning .So really what's up with the bad reviews why all the haters. This movie is a real joy to behold .","

It is a pity that the films are not exposed chronologically, but it does not matter. Samuel Jackson - actor who starred in films for years, perfectly revealed his character.
Brie Larson....
Just a brilliant game, believable and bright. Replicas matched as well as possible.The costumes and filming is done very efficiently.With Love...","

Brie Larson is incredible has the main character, she really comes alive, never appears to bored once. I love the mid 90's setting, considering it is set before any of the marvel movies. Samuel L. Jackson really steals some of the movie has a young Nick Fury. I like the idea it's different from other Marvel movies, really stands alone, the film has twists some critics won't see coming. Effects that would make Star Wars fan proud.

I enjoy watching most superhero movies unless they are really bad, and I can't remember the last time I came across a really bad one. I find them to be a good mental escape.There are lots of negative reviews, and ""1"" or ""2"" ratings, for this movie, and I can't understand why. Maybe because one little thing about the movie disappoints a viewer and they use that as an excuse to review it harshly? Maybe some object to a female in the Captain Marvel role?For me I really enjoyed this movie. I like Brie Larson and I like the performance she gives here. The whole movie is a bit whimsical and Larson's character often acts in whimsical ways. I found that refreshing because it all is sci-fi fantasy and there is no reason to take it too seriously.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library.","

The acting was fantastic, the plot was great, and the reference to Mallrats by Stan Lee was epic.It was also great to reminisce with the 90's music soundtrack, and to have a good chuckle at the retorts to every day misogyny that all women face. Particularly Captain Marvel stealing the guys bike who tells her to smile, and blasting Yon-Rogg after he goes on about how proud he is of her and that she will only be ""ready"" when she beats him in a fight with no weapons.The backstory was great and left it open for sequels or prequels (and probably a Netflix series too).Absolutely bloody brilliant.I think everyone who complained about this movie were really looking hard for things to complain about. Either that or they are too fragile to cope with a badass female lead taking the mickey out of misogyny.More please!","

"Captain Marvel","bopdog","9 March 2019","I walked into the theater with low expectations, but was blown away. OMG - ""Captain Marvel"" was AWESOME. I suspect the initial low ratings on IMDb were from ""fanboys"" and other young people who wanted chases and shoot-em-ups - the kind of mass melees and Battle Royales seen in the Avenger gang fight movies. That's OK - each to his own taste! But this Marvel movie actually dealt with real and important themes that sucked me right in, and kept me riveted until the end.In my personal cosmology, on some level we are all the same, and time does not exist, except as a shared construct, and perception is projection (i.e., in some way we make it all up). OK - that's me. But to see Marvel wrestle with these ideas, present them in a fascinating and thrilling story-line, AND feature a cat? I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven. Do not be mislead - there is tons of action, too, and brilliant FX and Sci-Fi dazzle.And... it doesn't hurt that Brie Larson is sturdy, talented, and adorable. And this was Samuel L. Jackson's best role in what? 20 Years? He played a good guy for once... even kind of a hero. That sat VERY well on him. I hope he considers doing more positive movie roles henceforth.Bottom line: if you've been watching Marvel/DC movies with a child's eye, consider if it is time to step up to a grown-up version. You stand a chance of advancing your movie-art appreciation with this. Possibly. And if not, let enough time pass until you're ready for the adult world. Please consider that this might be a great movie to begin life like the grown-ups do it. You'll have a blast!","

All of the characters, especially Ole Sam, he's perfect in this, and Ben Mendelsohn's character Talos, well it did it for me. Larson conquers the role from her first appearance till after-credit scene. I am unsure what else one would want or expect from the character, she was the personification of it.

However it addresses some of the issues/barriers that was there during the early 90's. Plus it shows about good female friendships and all kinds friendships, strength of a single mom, the hidden potential of a ill-treated girl... So yeah I like Captain Marvel!

She has only no memories of her life before adulthood but in her dreams she sees a woman with a kind face and wise eyes.It's another treat of a superhero putting down the villains with great special effects and nice one-liners. It's a decent script and I thought her origin story was well told without taking up too much screen time. The humour is well played and Brie Larson does look good in that, 'rubber suit.'I liked the cat and the portrayal of 1990s technology that looks Victorian by modern standards. Was that Windows 95 or 3.1? There are two post movie Easter egg scenes and I enjoyed them both very much.Criticisms? It seems petit but Danvers doesn't quite have the personality stature to match her uber powers when they get released near the end of the film.

And if Carol Denvers and his team were killing the innocent skrulls without knowing, i would expect her to be really charged up with guilt and sorrow for working for the enemy, not just her but i would expect some of her team mates to see this too and defect if possible and let the good guys and bad guys have a clear line between them. Those two parts would have really improved the story further in my opinion.The funny bits on the film were very mature and the had me laugh out loud, because many marvel film have really terrible jokes but this film did it very well. The CGI was very well used apart from some instances i could tell its looks like CGI but most of the time i couldn't tell.The Acting and Directing and Cinematography is perfect, every character fitted their roles.Am going to rewatch this film once again, i feel there's still more good stuff in there.","

"Captain Marvel","gcsman","8 March 2019","I've seen this movie twice now. The first time through it felt a little disjointed, but I'm happy to say that the second time through the various pieces fell together better. The whole storyline is essentially one uninterrupted sequence beginning with Carol on the Kree home planet Hala, through the guerilla mission against the Skrulls, and on to Earth where she meets Nick Fury and pieces out her true identity. There are really no side plots. My thoughts overall:First and most basic, this is a new Marvel Studios movie to have fun with. It's another chance to sit back and absorb yourself in a gratifying fantasy world with superheros doing their thing. What's not to like? The usual great production values, and a stacked cast including Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law, Annette Bening, Ben Mendelsohn, Gemma Chan -- and of course the scene-stealing cat Goose (whose character poster has just been voted the fan favorite).Before I forget to mention this: the end credits are beautifully done. They have the same style and feel as the credits from Wonder Woman (2017), which were also beautiful. Kudos!I'm pretty sure most of us in the theater were waiting for the second half where Carol finally goes full Binary mode (as briefly shown in the second trailer) and sure enough this carries a great Wow! factor. We haven't seen this kind of mid-air (or mid-space) heavyweight fight sequence since Man of Steel, which qualifies her for the MCU's Superwoman. I'm *never* going to get tired of watching that section and have my fingers crossed that we'll get more in Avengers Endgame. Also, I was wondering how they were going to do the costume transition from the rather cold green/blue tones of the Kree into the warmer, much more appealing classic red/blue design. The way it's done is really clever.But I'll probably just have to get used to Brie Larson's fairly light-textured voice. Like some others who've commented on this, I would have preferred it to have more weight (compare the voices of Bening or Chan in this movie). But my daughter assures me that it's all OK. if it's fine with younger viewers in the audience (particularly girls) who are seeing themselves represented on screen, then I won't complain.On the other hand, the most important bit of dialog in the movie comes very near the end where Carol pronounces ""I have nothing to prove to you"" to one of the key characters in a way that takes the classic stereotypical ""final confrontation of hero with villain"" scene and stands it on its head. Right on!! There are a number of feminist-flavor statements or setups throughout the film, but that one scene is where it really does hit home.From the trailers I think a lot of us figured that this ""origin story"" was going to depart significantly from the comic-book origins of CM (which the MCU has done with a number of other important characters). But ... yes and no. First, half the scenes in the trailers never appeared in the movie. But second, the story ended up hewing surprisingly close to the line in the CM comics, with just a couple of character switches. It's ingeniously done. There is just one MAJOR change from the comics storyline vis-a-vis the Kree and Skrulls, which I won't give away, and which works well enough and also retroactively ties in with certain plot elements of the the Agents of Shield TV series.The well publicized motion-capture and de-aging of Fury and Coulson is pretty good, but the technique is still not seamless (Coulson particularly looked somewhat artificial). It would just make more sense to me, if something is set well in the past, not to spend a lot of screen time on familiar characters de-aged.Bottom line for me is that this is a good movie, without being the MCU's best. It does however fill a necessary step in the extended Avengers/Thanos/etc. storyline that has been building up for so long. Yes CM does push social boundaries, but not as much as Black Panther did. What I mean is that for BP, virtually the entire cast were black. To be equally radical for women, the MCU needs to make a movie where almost all the superheros are female ... and to point out the obvious, they've already made a bunch where they're almost all male, so why not? Let's have it, Marvel!OK: now for the trolls, who sadly but predictably jumped on the ratings for CM just like they said in their ludicrous flame-wars before its release. I REALLY wish the rest of us didn't have to waste our time with these hypersensitive misogynists whose only aim is to destroy. However, what's new about their pathetically nasty reactions to CM is that finally these have become outrageous enough that they have provoked collective counterattacks at the institutional level, not just from individuals. The Rotten Tomatoes site has taken steps to purge them, and the entire Disney corporation has actually stepped in with its own response. Not that I'm automatically in favor of what Disney does (e.g. their gutless firing of director James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy), but in this case I think they are doing the right thing. Society has to work out a better way to prevent the damages that trolling, hate speech, and misogyny can wreak. And a necessary step is just what's happening now -- to expose them for what they are in the cold light of day.However, in the meantime we need to have some tools to get Troll-Free Ratings (TFRs) for the movies we care about. Fortunately, IMdB provides the material to do that, because unlike other sites it actually supplies full breakdowns of the viewer voting. Here's how to use the IMdB scores easily and conveniently to get a TFR:First look at the bar graph of the voters' ratings (which you get by clicking on the number of voters just below the mean score). For CM you'll see a pile of votes in the 1/10 bin. Those are the trolls. Eliminate that bin from the average, and you'll get a much more accurate score. Even quicker, look at the ""median"" rating which does better than the average at de-weighting extremely low or high votes. (Just for fun, look at how CM rates with ""females under 18"" versus ""males over 45"".)Better yet, just look at the shape of the bar graph and it's obvious where the true center is. For CM, it's about 7.5, and I think that's fairly much on the mark. This center is technically called the mode of the distribution, and there is a useful statistical rule of thumb to calculate it, which is this: mode = 3 (median) - 2 (mean). For example, at the time when I'm writing this, CM has 86,475 votes with a mean of 6.8 (heavily dragged down by more than 11,000 trolls) and a median of 7. The mode is then 7.4. The ""mode"" is a terrific way to get the TFR.BUT: (and this is important): the great majority of IMdB voters are male, whereas the moviegoing public is pretty much half-and-half male and female. So a still better thing to do, after you've cut out the trolls, is to take the men's rating and average it *equally* with the women's rating. Thanks to IMdb showing these details broken down by age and gender, you can do that. Women do rate CM higher, but once you eliminate the troll votes it's actually not much higher. than the men.As a final thought, you'll see a pileup of votes in the 10/10 bin too. So are these people ""anti-trolls""? Not necessarily. I would argue that a 10/10 vote here is a lot more likely to be sincere and representative of the movie's impact on that viewer than a 1/10 vote is. The aim of an absurdly low vote is to destroy, whereas the aim of an only-slightly-high vote is to promote. Here I'll side with the promoters.","

Everyone goes to criticize like they're getting paid for it instead of just watching movies to enjoy them. I believe the actress chosen portrayed Captain Marvel well. She has a dry sense of humor but that doesn't make her flat. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think it's worth adding to the marvel collection. People are so harsh and egotistical.

I had hoped for the best, but expected to be let down. I am happy to say that I was presently surprised. While this is an origin story, I really liked the original way of introducing the character. Every member of the cast, right down to the cat, was outstanding. Larson and Jackson have great chemistry, leading to excellent humorous scenes. Also on that note, I have to admit that despite her personal issues, Larson knocked this out of the park. I don't think anyone else could have embodied Carol Danvers better. Have to give credit where due. This is already one of my favorite Marvel movies, right behind the Guardians.","

"Captain Marvel","murrayspeer","5 November 2019","The mid-90s in sci-fi and superhero movies were almost universally moody, slow-paced, and under lit. (Think Batman Forever, Independence Day, The Shadow, Stargate, The Crow, Strange Days, Species, Highlander III, etc.) I don't think Captain Marvel needed to copy that atmosphere entirely, but I sure would have liked more opportunities to feel like I was in a 90s movie. For example, if the action had taken place in the dark until Carol embraces her power which coincides with the first full sunrise of the movie, which could be teased as she moves toward that acceptance, it would have had much deeper significance. Overall it lacked the visionary feeling of the best recent Marvel Studios films. All of that being said, I really enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to watching it again. 9/10","

Past that is a terrific story that is filled with laughter, awe, action, drama and yes there is a strong women's vibe. And there should be, CM is one of the most powerful characters in the MCU so anyone complaining that she's too powerful or that the fights are too easy should really pick up a comic.
Brie does a fantastic job at starting the film as a characteristic ""flyboy(girl)"" and morphs into a badass hero who clearly digs her unleashed power and is not afraid to show it. Shes someone who stands to be a beacon for all in the MCU. (I can't wait for the banter between her and the other heroes)

"Captain Marvel","MajorMAlice","10 March 2019","Captain Marvel is a good film, not a great film. It's not perfect either, but which of the MCU movies is? It is entertaining though. It is definitely a WHOLE lot better than the Thor MCU movies or the original Hulk entry. Is it Infinity War good? No way. Guardians of the Galaxy good? Not quite, but just about.Larson's character is a little dull and the reaction to some of her jokes and banter with Fury was just as dull in the theater we saw it in.Coulson's (Clark Gregg) screen time is little to none, and as an Agents of Shield fan, I was personally sad that it did not explore more of his character.Samuel Jackson was Samuel Jackson like you see him in every movie he's ever been in. The Skrulls were cool. The cat was funny. The bit of background that the producers decided to add in this film was just about right.The 90's feel was pretty well done, from Rock the Vote posters to the ""Madonna"" look, to the cars.In as far as the 'PC'-ness some are complaining about and which are generating 90% of the bad reviews, it is really the same PCness these people look for and disparage in every movie they see. Look at the reviews for Jumanji, Welcome to the Jungle. ""They"" will find it in anything, because they live their lives looking for it. For every bad review, there is a person who: 1. Promised they wouldn't see it even though they knew they would; 2. Didn't see it, but rated it badly anyway (and WILL eventually see it); 3. Those who otherwise would not see it, but because of all the controversy will now see it. As such, I don't have to suggest anyone see this film. I'm pretty certain most everyone, on this planet at least, will. :)","

"Captain Marvel","masonsaul","8 March 2019","Captain Marvel is probably the most generic MCU movie without ever straying into actually awful territory. Essentially an overly familiar origin story saved by a breezy pace, strong supporting cast and some genuinely smart decisions when it comes to handling the Skrulls that completely avoids any potential uncomfortable subtext.The decision to make Carol Danvers a blank slate for the majority means Brie Larson is given next to nothing to work with, having to rely instead on the trademark quips and charm that she obviously excels at. It's also a lot of fun whenever she shares the screen with Samuel L. Jackson, who gets to show a more fun loving side to a younger Fury.Ben Mendelsohn is easily the film's saving grace. Talos both plays into and cleverly subverts the kind of character he's usually given in these kinds of films. An initially one note villain with so much more going on beneath the surface who delivers the majority of the film's best jokes.To say Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden directed the film feels inaccurate. This is the most bland, voiceless, clearly made by a studio construction any of these have had. Nothing is terrible yet very little is memorable which is so frustrating for a film that starts with one of the best opening shots of any MCU film.Pinor Toprak's score is actually amazing. It's the only aspect that's full of life, wearing its inspirations on its sleeve and favouring creating something new over callbacks. The film also has plenty of time on the soundtrack to include so many iconic 90s songs without overloading itself.","

After making 455 million in it's opening weekend, I decided to wait a bit before going to see this. Opening weekend for MCU is just too busy for this old guy.Let's get the Lowedown on the scores...Cast=10
Acting=7
Plot=9
Ending=9
Story=7
Movie Score= 8.4One thing to say about MCU is they always get a stellar cast...I guess that's the appropriate term for a movie like this. The acting isn't top notch strictly because movies like this aren't really about the performance.Plot: Carol Danvers becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. I love origin stories that go back in time, but to be honest I was hooked as soon as I saw that Blockbuster in the trailer. With a mid and end credits scene, the ending is worth a watch as it ties into Endgame. Unfortunately, I found a few story holes that gave me pause, but all-in-all they did a good job.Favorite Quote: ""You know anything about a lady blowing up a Blockbuster? Witnesses say she was dressed for laser tag.""Let's see how the Genre scores add up...Imagine=10
CGI=9
Pace=8If Captain Marvel was to get full marks, it has to come at least close to the comic book. I saw good detail on the Skrulls and the war with the Kree...maximum effort here. The CGI was great, but not exceptional...loved the Anti-aging CGI on Fury, but Coulson no so much. The pace was solid, albeit predictable for a comic book film...all boxes were checked but no surprises.Comic=7
Funny=7
Genre Score: 8.2Total Score: 8.3I got a little teary-eyed when she crashed into that Blockbuster...but not in the reason you might think. Knowing the connection between Captain Marvel and my favorite Marvel character, I was really looking forward to this. This was a solid watch...it checks all the boxes for an MCU movie. The only thing was there was no great story hitch or unique twist to make it great.Who's my favorite Marvel character? Silver Surfer","

"Captain Marvel","sweidman-28016","12 March 2019","Captain Marvel Review:Captain Marvel is the 21st film in the MCU and it follows Carol Danvers who becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. As most of you know I'm a huge Marvel fan so there was no question that I wanted to see this. Unlike most audience members, I really liked this film (you can read about the audience stuff in my rant post). I thought it was an interesting and intriguing origin story. Anna Biden and Ryan Fleck did a good job directing this. This was their first major film so good for them. Marvel likes to do that. Brie Larson as Carol Danvers was a perfect fit. I thought she developed the character well and made it her own. She's clever, ambitious, and sometimes humorous which made the film very enjoyable with her scenes. Not only that but her relationship with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) was literally the best part of the film. The chemistry was spot on and it made the friendship believable and feel real. He did great as Nick Fury again. This is probably one of my favorite performances that he did with Nick Fury. Annette Bening was in it briefly but I loved her. She's such an amazing actress. There's a twist with her character that was cool and might upset some who are true to the comics but I don't care. I should also add the cat, Goose, is an amazing character and I loved him! All the characters made for an enjoyable film and a good plot. Something I really loved about the plot was it made for questioning and thinking throughout so it was like a drama. Yes, there's action, and may I add very good action scenes, but the drama aspect was my favorite. The visual effects were pretty good in this. Lots of cool stuff, especially in the first shot you see of the Kree planet (I forgot the name of it). There were a few spots that were noticeable with it but not many. The makeup and hairstyling was very good. I thought it was cool what they did. I liked the super suits and costumes. The cinematography was pretty good for a marvel film. There were a few shots, one in particular that takes place outside in a backyard a little past sunset that I really liked. It reminded me kind of Annihilation with the shot of Natalie Portman walking towards The Shimmer. It was also colorful like Thor: Ragnarok. The score I would consider colorful too. It was interesting and pretty good. It had a tech vibe to it, also like Thor: Ragnarok. Since the movie takes place in the 90s, there's some pretty good songs added. One sequence in the final battle had a perfect song playing. Some thought it was dumb and copying Guardians of the Galaxy but I thought it was fun. Also Guardians of the Galaxy is apart of the MCU and people loved those sequences so what's the big problem?! I didn't have too many problems with this movie. The only thing I'd say is there's a part at the beginning with a trippy sequence that made it hard to follow. I understand it was supposed to do that, but it made an awkward shift. It was predictable what was going to happen to with the conflict. Also there's a reoccurring thing that comes to play in major role that was in the other MCU films that left me having to research it because something seemed out of the timeline then. Once I figured it out it made sense but there's one part I still question. Other than that I thought this was a great addition to the MCU and Captain Marvel will be a great addition in Avengers: Endgame. If you haven't seen the other films you could probably still watch this. There may be a few things you won't understand but it's a great time watching this film!My Grade: A-","

"Captain Marvel","CANpatbuck3664","9 March 2019","I'm not familiar with the character of Captain Marvel from the comics so coming in as a fresh face, I think they did a good job of developing her from start to finish. They even utilize a couple of story devices that I'm getting sick of like the protagonist suffering from amnesia. I feel like the Bourne movies made that a popular story element and its been repeated again and again. But in Captain Marvel, it allows us to learn about Ms. Danvers without her losing her resolve or requiring a huge exposition dump near the start of the movie. They integrate her flashbacks well and in an artistic manner to make them more palatable. I was interested in where Danvers had come from and while her overall arc may not break the mould, they gradually feed you little bits of her personality. This helps keep your interest up and helps the movie get through some of the slower scenes.I also like how the movie plays with the idea that changing perspectives on a situation can shine a light on what's really going on. There's a curveball thrown in with the Skrulls that was inspired for a comic book movie and I liked how Carol had the wherewithal to figure out what was going on and adjust. Her motivation was pure but there was room for interpretation because of how much she was altered by her experiences. It was a nice touch and I appreciated how the movie wasn't committed to a very straightforward and simplistic narrative.The controversy surrounding Captain Marvel centres around it's star Brie Larson because of some comments she made. I think that its largely overblown and it shouldn't affect how you perceive the movie. I think she's great as Carol Danvers and her performance is the engine that drives Captain Marvel. She hits all the right beats and has the makings of a formidable player in future Marvel movies. She didn't blow me away but I expected good things and she met those expectations. Samuel L. Jackson is charming and charismatic in everything and he works well with Larson to form a pretty solid duo. Annette Bening got an interesting part as Dr. Wendy Lawson and the Supreme Intelligence and I think she made the most of her screen time. I initially groaned when I saw that Ben Mendelsohn was playing Talos, he's a great actor but he's been in so many villainous roles lately, he's being oversaturated. But due to the nice twist with his character, he sold it and was an effective member of this cast. Lashana Lynch was good with what she had to work with, her best scenes come in the last act and she got her chance to shine. I also thought Jude Law did well in his role as Yon-Rogg who serves as an early mentor to Vers.As much as I want to tell you that Captain Marvel revolutionizes the genre and will be remembered as the pinnacle of Marvel's stable of movies, that's not the case here. I'm going to put it in the really good but not great category, objectively there's nothing wrong with that but Captain Marvel represents a solid execution of the Marvel playbook with only a few surprises. I did genuinely like the twist with the Skrulls but I'm not going to be walking away applauding how bold and fresh Captain Marvel is outside of that. The 2nd act has stretches that border on being too slow, they aren't without purpose but the pace does have a little slack in it. The only other real complaint I had was it would have been nice to see more action with Danvers using her entire power set. We get some good scenes at the end but as she even says that she's been fighting ""with one hand tied behind my back.""I was lucky enough to see this with 2 friends and we all walked out of the movie shrugging our shoulders but largely singing Captain Marvel's praises. We all agreed that it featured good performances from the cast, that they weaved the Carol Danvers storyline into the larger MCU as well as they could have (including utilizing some well worn plot threads like the hero having amnesia or the twist reveal of the real antagonist) and that Captain Marvel amounted to artistic and fun execution of the MCU origin story. I don't think this will be remembered as one of the best MCU movies and much like recent comic book movies Wonder Woman and Black Panther, it will have a hard time living up to all the hype surrounding the production. There are some slow stretches (mostly in the middle) and while it executes the formula well, there isn't much that's going to shock or surprise if you're familiar with most of the movies in the MCU. But this is a movie that at minimum achieves what it wants to achieve and has some shining moments scattered throughout the film. As long as you haven't turned against it already, I think you'll have fun with Captain Marvel and its worth checking out in the theatre.","

"Captain Marvel","Chalice_Of_Evil","7 March 2019","After a nice acknowledgement of the late Stan Lee (and all his cameos throughout the Marvel films) in the MARVEL opening logo and a special tribute to him, the film begins with us introduced to Brie Larson's Carol Danvers (currently going by the name Vers), who has a blue nosebleed, has clearly been in a fight and/or accident, and as a result is suffering fragmented memories of her previous life. First thing you'll have to adapt to with this film is its non-linear storytelling. We shift between past and present, which gives you an idea of just how confused Carol must be feeling. She's a Kree, which are 'noble warrior heroes' who fight against green aliens called Skulls. She's part of a team led by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). They have an interesting relationship, trading jabs at one another, but clearly respecting each other too.Also of note in the film are the relationships between Larson's Carol and the other characters. When something happens that leads to Carol crash-landing into a Blockbuster video store on Earth, it's not long before she encounters a younger version of Nick Fury (a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson, who's actually *likeable* here thankfully, as I'd been getting tired of him appearing in everything and pretty much playing himself every time). Their relationship is pretty much the 'heart' of the movie. Fury starts off wary of her, but eventually comes to respect/admire her and a trust forms between them.One reason why Fury's so likeable in this film is his dynamic with Carol, but another reason is his love for the scene-stealing not-cat named Goose, who got the biggest laughs, though isn't the only source of humour in the movie. It also comes from the 90's being...the 90's (slow typing and loading on computers, movie/TV show/music references, etc) and Carol herself. Despite what certain others have said, Carol is NOT 'unlikeable'. Claims of her trying to make snarky comments like Tony Stark and coming off as a worse person than him couldn't be further from the truth. I personally have had enough of Mr. Snark and his mumbled speed-talking. Carol has a wry sense of humour and comes off as a pretty cool person you'd actually *want* to hang with (five minutes spent with Tony and I'm fairly sure most people, even his 'fans', would be punching him like Carol punches a Skrull disguised as an old lady in this film).Speaking of Skrulls, Ben Mendelsohn's Skrull character, Talos, starts off as your typical villain. He looks alien, but acts quite 'human' with his line deliveries/references/etc. However, he actually proves to be not quite what he seems and it allows for interesting character development. Another important relationship Carol has is with her former fellow fighter pilot, Maria Rambeau, and her daughter. Their friendship proves crucial to the story. The movie really hits its stride once all these^ characters come together. Carol surrounds herself with a good group of characters who prove useful, but who don't take away from her.The story of Carol Danvers is about what makes her who she is. Those against her try to make her a 'better'/'the best' version of herself, but we're shown that what makes her special isn't her powers, but rather her humanity and who she is as a person. Having said that, when she finally lets loose with her powers in all their glowing, gravity-defying-hair glory...it's quite something to behold (and set perfectly to classic 90's music). Some will claim she's 'overpowered', but she's no more 'overpowered' than Superman or various other male superheroes.And that's^ the crux of the issue here for some people...that she's doing what male superheroes can do. For certain types of people there seems to be five stages when it comes to seeing a female-led movie: 1) Anger (""How DARE a female be the lead! Women should only be side characters/love interests/villains!""), 2) Denial (""This movie isn't successful! It's a flop!""...despite all evidence to the contrary), 3) Attempting to 'rationalize' the film's success (""This movie's only successful because..."" insert lame excuse here such as people only liking it because of some 'agenda', people being 'paid' to say good things, etc), 4) Whininess (""WHY do they keep doing this?! Making more female-led movies...don't they know these genres like sci-fi, superheroes, etc are meant to be MALE-oriented?"") and 5) Seeking out new targets, starting all over again/lather, rinse, repeat (sadly, there's no 'Acceptance' stage for these people). Seeing the negativity regarding this film only proves one thing: there's a LOT of insecure people out there.This is a 'different' sort of Marvel film...but in no way 'bad'. It's about time they shook things up a bit and gave us something new, as it prevents things from getting 'stale' (the only expected thing here is two credits scenes, one in the middle and one at the end...both of which are worth sticking around for). And if Captain Marvel is to eventually take over from Tony Stark as head of the Avengers...I, for one, welcome our new alien DNA-infused leader.","

"Captain Marvel","ahmed_zizo73","9 March 2019","I don't know why so many bad review but in my opinion I really enjoyed every second of this movie.
Brie Larson was good and I see she acts well with no risks.
I love the cat and Samuel Jackson specially with comedy scenes.
I like the sequence of movie thanks to it's director.
Only the end scene wasn't perfect cause it seems captain marvel is like a god with no weakness.
but at all it's fun movie and different than any marvel movie and this give it more depth.
it should take 9 rating but I give 10 cause I didn't get bored of any scenes during watching.","

"Captain Marvel","77Lynne","10 March 2019","This was a really good movie and it's everything a woman would like it to be. It's a funny, well paced superhero movie with well rounded writing of strong female leads that broaches the tricky and often hostile world of women in a boys club. It's entertaining, well acted, CGI is believable and the music is awesome! Don't believe the online smear campaign of fragile egos that are dumping all over this film, it's a very good action flick. Plus the cat is really cool.","

"Captain Marvel","tomgillespie2002","18 March 2019","It says a lot about the mammoth universe built by Kevin Feige and the folks at Marvel over the past 11 years that merely the glimpse of a modified pager displaying the colours of their costume is enough to generate a huge amount of buzz around the arrival of a new superhero. Captain Marvel's introduction was teased during the traditional post-credits stinger of last year's Avengers: Infinity War, and now, just under a year later, Brie Larson's Carol Danvers finally makes her bow. Black Panther became a cultural phenomenon, and Infinity War delivered and then some on its promise to bring this breathtaking (first) saga closer to an end, so the small-scale and light-hearted Ant-Man and the Wasp was a welcome, if underwhelming palette cleanser. Captain Marvel is the studio's first female-led superhero film, so there's a weight of expectation behind Marvel once again.There has been a wave of ugliness online in protest against the idea of female empowerment and Brie Larson's pro-feminist comments before the film even premiered, but an opening weekend of north of $500 million has silenced the haters and, with any hope, brought us closer to a future when a hero's gender or sexuality is irrelevant to a film's success. Captain Marvel is far from perfect. In fact, it relies heavily on Marvel's tried-and-tested origin story formula we saw a lot of when this universe was still in its first phase, although directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck toy around with the structure enough to keep things slightly less familiar. Anyone who was keen to write Captain Marvel off as an example of forced diversity should take the time to actually watch it. Don't get me wrong, the film takes a strong pro-feminist stance and tackles issues plaguing our modern world, but it does so with subtlety. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel is strong, confident, even arrogant at times, but just like Tony Stark or Dr. Strange, she is also flawed, troubled and - despite the mystery surrounding her ancestry - recognisably human.The warrior known as Vers (Larson) is a member of Starforce, an elite band of soldiers operating within the Kree Empire tasked with infiltrating the Skrulls, a race of shape-shifting aliens they have been at war with since before they can remember. Vers is troubled by dreams that feel like memories she does not remember, but her commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) trains her to put aside her emotion to focus on the enemy. During a mission to rescue one Starforce's own, Vera is captured by Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), who proceeds to dissect her memories before they all crash down on a strange, primitive planet. That planet is Earth, and the year is 1995. It isn't long before an eager, two-eyed agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. called Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is drawn to this mysterious stranger and is caught up in her desire to uncover the secrets of her past, along with learning of an intergalactic war that may one day threaten his home. With the help of old friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and a cat named Goose, Vers discovers that she was born Carol Danvers, and that everything she has been taught about who she is and what she's fighting for may actually be a lie.Although Marvel have done period before with Captain America: The First Avenger back in 2011, Boden and Fleck were clearly having fun revelling in some 90's nostalgia. Although some of the music choices are a little on-the-nose, the appearance of a Blockbuster store and the sound of a dial-up internet connection will delight those, like me, who grew up in the decade. The big joke is that while Carol embarks on galaxy-hopping adventures with the Kree, down here on Earth everything takes an age to load. Captain Marvel switches seamlessly between these two extremes with good humour, and for a character that is destined to become the franchise's next cosmic powerhouse, the low-key approach to her origin actually works in the film's favour. It also allows time for Larson to develop the character, whether it be bouncing off Jackson's one-liners or discovering her old self with her best friend. Larson is great: strong but not over-powered, cocky but endearing. Despite Mendelsohn's scene-stealing, Larson ensures that it'll be Captain Marvel's appearance you'll be eagerly awaiting in the upcoming Avengers: Endgame. Formulaic? Certainly, but Marvel knows how to entertain, and they can't exactly re-define the genre with every film.","

"Captain Marvel","itsbobr","19 June 2019","After finally discovering who she is Vers/ Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) knows what her mission is when two Alien forces go to war.I was ready to shut this down within 10-minutes because no one could tell what was going on. We see loads of CGI battles, some banter between Vers (yes, that's Brie Larson, too) and Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and also with Vers and Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening), and very darkened scenes as well and we still had no idea what was going on.The movie that we will come to understand is when Vers lands on planet C-53, that's Earth. Now, as we go along, we will begin to understand all that confusion we saw in the first 10-minutes. So hang in there, it's quite good. It's a good story as Carol begins to piece together her life and who she was and who she is now when for 6-years everyone thought Carol died in that crash with Dr. Lawson (Annette Bening).What are the Kree after? They are after a core energy source to control the entire universe. When Carol shoots at the engine she believes is the core energy source (in the plane she and Dr. Lawson were in) there is a power surge into Carol's body and that is where her powers come from.Notables: Samuel L. Jackson as Shield Agent, Fury and he believes Carol is a good guy and becomes her side-kick so to speak; Clark Gregg as Shield Agent Phil Coulson; Ben Mendelsohn as Talos who convinces Carol she is on the wrong side; Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeay, a friend and fellow test pilot back in the day before Carol crashed; Annette Bening plays a bad person as Supreme Intelligence and a good one as Dr. Wendy Lawson; (yes, this can get confusing); Lee Pace as Ronan, a Kree soldier under Yon-Rogg; Djimon Hounsou as Korath a Kree warrior under Yon-Rogg.We do see Stan Lee as Stan Lee as a passenger on a train. The music was very, very good all the way through.Now, here's the thing. At no time was Carol Danvers referred to as Captain Marvel, and you now know where her powers came from so there was no Shazam. See? Billy Batson and his Shazam remain safe. Carol will come to be known as Captain Marvel or as MAR VEL as Carol recalled the real name of Dr. Lawson...... maybe. After the credits run we will see a scene for a sequel to this movie, and then there is a statement that says Captain Marvel will also be in AVENGERS ENDGAME. Can't wait.So this was very enjoyable and I am glad I didn't shut it down. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Yes, quite a few good lines. Language: Brief small stuff.

"Captain Marvel","DeadMansTrousers","8 March 2019","People are becoming far too obnoxious when reviewing comic book movies. Bad reviews including coments like ""you've seen one you've seen them all"" are evidence of exactly that. When you read a comic book or go to see a movie based off one you go for fun and to be entertained. Not to see a preformance of a Shakespeare play, or an Oscar winning film.Point being is that if you can't just go to enjoy these films for the entertainment they provide without harshly picking them apart or turning into an internet troll over them...simply don't.Overall I found this movie highly enjoyable, and I thought Brie Larson did a good job. I thought the soundtrack was perfect and I loved all the 90s nostalgia sprinkled throughout the film. I recommend you ignore the trolls and decide on your own what you think of this.","

"Captain Marvel","PyroSikTh","12 March 2019","As much as I love Marvel movies, their single-character movies can feel a little dull and uninteresting in comparison to the big tentpoles. Sure, seeing Nick Fury with two eyes and hair in the 90s was something to look forward to, but without a prior connection to Captain Marvel herself, it was hard for me to get uncomfortably overhyped.And in some ways Captain Marvel is a victim of Marvel's single-character movies. We've come so far into the franchise now that going back to see the origin of yet another hero and how/why they're relevant just doesn't seem as enthralling any more. That said, Marvel's molasses of average movies is still pretty damn high, especially when compared to other blockbusters and franchises around at the moment, and Captain Marvel is also no exception there. There's very little to hate.Vers is a Kree warrior with the unusual ability to shoot photon blasts from her fists. She's wrapped up in the Skrull/Kree war (the Skrulls being a race of shapeshifters), but is haunted of dreams of another life. While by the strictest definition, Captain Marvel is not an origin story, it still kind of is. While she has her powers from the movie's opening, it's still about her discovering who she is and what she's really capable of. Instead of starting at the beginning of her journey, her origin is instead told in flashbacks that are slowly revealed, expanded upon, and explained as the movie goes on. It's a good way of establishing her origin, and crafting a story around it, while also tying it into her character development as the movie goes along. It creates twists and turns that you don't see coming, re-ordering the general structure of a typical origin story. And I like anything that's different and changes things up, so thumbs up there.Unfortunately Captain Marvel herself is outshone by almost every other character in the movie. Yes, her determination and quest for answers are charming and carry the entire movie, but it's characters like a younger, more cheerful Nick Fury and an endearingly comical Talos who are responsible for making the movie as captivating to watch as it is. Samuel L Jackson is clearly having a lot of fun here, and like every one of his roles, he gives it his all, including being able to act like a guy in his forties instead of his seventies. The phenomenal make-up and CG to make him look younger were only one ingredient in how convincingly younger he appeared. Ben Mendelsohn honestly kind of steals the show as the Skrull leader, managing to carefully toe the line between menacing and goofy. They lean in to how potentially silly green, pointy-eared aliens who can shapeshift are, and use that to poke fun, while also not diminishing how deadly their abilities can be. Mendelsohn shows once again how capable an actor he really is.Talking of the humour, this is the freshest it's been in a while. Not once did it undercut more dramatic moments, feel forced in, or just be too much for its own good. Brie Larson's comedy bone comes out full force, and while she doesn't quite manage to encapsulate the jokiness of Tony Stark, she's pretty close. Another movie or two and she'll ease right into it. Another big source of comedy is the interactions between humans and aliens, and their worlds and cultures colliding. Goose the Flerken is a big example of this; adorable kitty cat? Or dangerous and unpredictable monster? Both outcomes are hilarious.Marvel has never been particularly great with their music, and Captain Marvel attempts to eschew that in the same way Guardians did, but without the same panazz. We get a whole album's worth of female-led 90's classics, from No Doubt and Garbage to TLC and Salt-N-Pepa. They do give the film's it own sonic identity and harkens back to the era, however some of the uses, particularly in the third act, feel misplaced. Come As You Are by Nirvana is used at one point, and lyrically it fits quite well with what's going on, but musically it comes out of nowhere and doesn't match the tone of the surrounding scenes whatsoever. Just A Girl by No Doubt is also a far cry from action scene music, and yet there it is bursting in over the top of a critical sequence of Captain Marvel kicking names and taking ass.Captain Marvel is by no means a bad movie. As a blockbuster goes it's one of the best you can get, but as a Marvel movie - thanks to the high quality across the board - it falls somewhere in the middle. It's nowhere near as good as Infinity War, Guardians, Winter Soldier, or Civil War, but it's also nowhere near as bad as Thor 2 or Iron Man 3. As far as female-lead superhero movies, I'd say Captain Marvel absolutely beats out Wonder Woman. I give it a flawed 8/10.P.S. I still think Danver's Ms. Marvel costume had the far superior colour scheme, and I wish they'd kept it. Black and gold with a red sash is unique in the superhero sphere. Instead they doubled down on her mediocrity by making her red and blue just like everyone else. The leotard and prostitute boots were too much, I agree, but that colour scheme (and the sash) was just too good to completely abandon. They even cycle through the black and gold scheme on her Kree uniform and it looks SO GOOD. Why tease me Marvel? Why?","

"Captain Marvel","kjproulx","9 March 2019","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been an impressive run of films, whether you have loved every one of them or not. In my opinion, ranging from mediocre to fantastic, this franchise has had its ups and downs like any, but nothing has really been a huge misstep, as producer Kevin Feige has been steering this ship in a safe direction from start to finish. Captain Marvel is the latest introduction to a character in this franchise and while it may not rank among the best films this franchise has had to offer thus far, it's a welcome addition to the family, so to speak.Following Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) as she discovers her past and learns who she used to be on Earth, a relationship forms between her and a few familiar faces from Shield, mainly in Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). With a war between the two races of Kree and Skrulls, Carol finds herself caught in the middle of it all, while also discovering her past along the way. Filled with enough energy to keep you engaged from start to finish, this is a breezy addition to the franchise as a whole. Sadly, I don't feel that this film explored any of the characters enough and it really did feel like a stepping stone for a larger story to be told in the future.Feeling very much like the early days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with movies like Thor or Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain Marvel has a very solid introduction to this universe, but there's a lot of room to improve. Brie Larson delivers a solid performance here and I look forward to seeing more from this character in future instalments, but I wasn't blown away by any means. Aside from an interesting backstory, she really isn't given anything to do and almost seems unbeatable, which is kind of a draw-back for future stakes that may arise. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson's chemistry is easily the biggest highlight of this film and will probably keep even the uninterested fans entertained.Captain Marvel gets off to a very messy start throughout the first 20 minutes. It finds its footing very fast, but I must admit that I was very worried when the movie first began. The way her past is quickly thrown in and jumbled around to set-up the rest of the film felt a little rushed, but the movie does slow down to a nice pace. It's not that I have a lot to complain about here, but there truly wasn't anything that wowed me about this film, which was disappointing, considering it's the final film that leads into the culmination of the last ten years with Avengers: Endgame.In the end, Captain Marvel doesn't do a whole lot to dazzle, but it works very well as a standalone origin for this character. I enjoyed myself quite a bit, but this formula has been done over and over again throughout the course of these 21 films and although the formula works, I feel something new has to be done once Avengers: Endgame brings this first segment of this universe to a close. I had a lot of fun with Captain Marvel, but it's by no means a great movie. I definitely recommend it to fans of this franchise (who will be the most impacted from it) and to those who are simply looking for a fun superhero flick. Captain Marvel delivered for me, but there was a lot that could have been improved upon.","

The movie is definitely more on the light side and humorous than action packed, however, it keeps one engaged and entertained. Can't wait for Endgame!!

Altogether engaging enjoyable romp that once you get past the attempts to tie it in with the MU stands up well as a solo escapade. I liked it but it seems to have upset a lot of the ott Marvel Brigade because it didnt rely solely on overhyped dysfunctional heroes fighting myriads of cgi enemies.

Humor and emotions are in the right dose, which is very rare these days. Charachters are alive, realistic, not just 2dimensional beings on the screen. The story is compelling, it really pulled me in.

I'm picky, and it was certainly in my top 3 favorite marvel movies (but I love aviation.) I thought the space battles were on par with Star Wars Episode 7 (better than guardians) and the story had lots of depth. It brought back memories and parallels with ""The Rocketeer"". Cookie cutter Marvel? Maybe. Origin stories always are ""cookie cutter"". This one was by far out of the norm though. Brie Larson was great! Funny but not cocky. Minimal feminist undertones (for those complaining). Let's face it, life sucked for the first female pilots and still sort of does.I honestly overlooked the gender and thought she was a total badass regardless of gender. Better than the Wonder-woman and the English speaking German supporting characters. The best part is that her story is an underdog story, and it has a character that channels her weakness into a strength. Sort of something most normies will relate to.","

"Captain Marvel","fcharette1969","10 March 2019","Where should I start? Captain Marvel gives us an all powerful being who is still very much human, especially in the fact that she doesn't know the extent of her own limits. Carol Denver's is strong, fierce, a perfect female role model while at the same time showing us that her emotions are part of what makes her who she is.Goose is a riot who deserves his own movie, but I digress. Captain Marvel manages to keep a light-hearted approach to some very serious issues. Betrayal and mental abuse are only a few of the issues addressed on a much deeper level, something that I understand will turn some viewers off as this requires them to actually think about what they have seen or heard.This movie is not an orgy of action and battle scenes. It is not a linear story that can be followed while half asleep. It is a remarkable piece if writing and acting that takes the origin of the character to a whole new level. We understand her motivation, her reasoning and learn in the process that there is no such thing as a black or white universe.Captain Marvel is a force to be feared and respected. A woman who proves to anyone in her way that she can dish it out better than anyone else, all while remaining caring towards others.Whatever the final say will be of those who cannot look beyond the multi-layer story, this movie will be for me a must show to my girls. No matter who tells them ""you can't"", I hope that this movie will show them that with strength and determination, they will in the end prove them all wrong.","

It wasnt too much and introduced the character well. The twist was unexpected but then I didnt go into the movie looking for faults.We thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I am glad they did this before they release a really unnecessary Black Widow movie.The post credit scenes were also great and really tied everything together, much like the scene at the end of Black Panther, this movie could easily serve as a stand alone or part of the bigger picture movie.Really enjoyable and fun and fresh.","

The worst Marvel movie would be the best in DCEU. And I don't hate DCEU, I feel sorry that they can get even close to Marvel, but to write so many hateful and wrong reviews is just sad. This one is definitely not the best MCU movie, but it is very good and just another hero introduction movie. You can see that Brie Larson didn't do anything similar in her career, but I find her like a really good choice for Captain Marvel. MCU needs to evolve and Captain Marvel is just that. I can't even imagine how much she evolved for all these years away from Earth, but she'll definitely be one of the main characters in Avengers End Game. Don't get discouraged with all these bad reviews, cause they are all fake. Can't wait to see it again.","

Literally almost every other superhero movie! I mean have you ever seen an X-Men film? How about Captain America?

If you like any other Marvel movies, you should like this.This is not only a great female superhero movie, it's a great superhero movie, period. If you're going to hate it just to hate it without seeing it? Go hug a cactus. Because it is on the same amazing level of quality as every other Marvel movie and deserves at least a chance.

The movie can be a bit confusing but it's a one that speaks about values and friends and of how we should embrace change. It's a very different avengers movie. But it's definitely worth a watch.","

"Captain Marvel","veriity","9 March 2019","You know, I saw the bad reviews and I was apprehensive.Then I thought, oh wait, I'm a GIRL and I watch what I want and I can make up my own damned mind.And that's what I did.First, Brie is entering the Marvel/Disney Universe late. Captain Mar-Vell didn't. The Kree didn't and the Universal war didn't. I mean, seriously. Why all the bashing? Oh wait. Brie doesn't have a penis. That's the Start and the stop of this movie bashing.Second, every time you think there's a crisis in the Marvel universe; there's something much MUCH bigger going on across more Multiverses. Another whole layer of things going on that makes what happened in the our nine realms look tiny.Just keep that in mind.Third, the movie just rocks. She's knocked down, kidnapped, brainwashed and told everything is just as it isn't. (Of course, this is also modified a bit because we don't want the movie to be 900 hours long) The important part is, she's off doing something so important that our little piece of the Multiverse is on a PAGER far, buried in her jacket. Because we're literally just that unimportant in the Multiverse scale.Her recovering her memories and putting it altogether before we get to the fact that she is the living Tesseract is just phenomenal.So wake up boys. Put on your big boy's pants and step aside. Yes, women can be heroes too.","

"Captain Marvel","valentinabonomelli","24 April 2019","I won't comment on all the dreadful reviews, as everyone has its own taste.
But as a young woman who loves movies and superheroes, I loved it. Unlike what many on here said, I stepped out of the cinema with a sense of fulfillment and purpose, feeling inspired - Captain Marvel is a strong woman that can and should be an example for women to come. It might not be a faithful-to-the-comics movie (I wouldn't know as I haven't read them) - and on that note I would understand why many disliked it. But it's certainly VERY far from deserving a 1 out of 10 - disliking and irrationally hating are two different things. Taken as a movie of its own, as a single part of the MCU, I think it's great. It's funny and carries the 2hrs of lenght extremely well (time literally flies). It has an interesting and fairly captivating story and yes, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a goddamn good Marvel movie.
Most people do not understand the importance of seeing a female super hero not being sexualised for once, and saying ""I have nothing to prove to you"".
Just watch it without getting biased by the nonsensical hate and make your own judgment.","

"Captain Marvel","baduffe","10 March 2019","This is only the second movie I wanted to review, and the reason I wanted to review it couldn't be more different than the first (Star Wars Last Jedi, which was terrible). I went into the theater with a hope that all of the negative reviews and speculation would be wrong, that the always solid MCU movies wouldn't let me down, and they didn't. All of the super negative far right and far left ""reviewers"" who wanted the movie to be something it isn't, were proven wrong. It's not a man hating movie, far from it, it's an entertaining buddy picture, with a super powerful being and a somewhat cynical federal agent who's been riding a desk for too many years. It's a very good movie that I felt might be getting a bad rep from people leaving one star reviews that haven't even seen it. Go see it, and make your own decision about it, and as always wait through the credits, two good scenes hiding in there.","

"Captain Marvel","astephanie-chamberlain","1 June 2019","I mostly came here to explain that not all people who rate a movie title on IMDB actually write a review. So you can't calculate the average score by only reading through the reviews. We can't actually calculate an average ourselves since we don't have access to all reviews but only to the written ones; only IMDB's algorithms would be able to do that calculation. I for one did enjoy the whole plot and the intrigue I felt throughout the movie, and also the different origins that were revealed. I understand and agree with the opinion that the character of Carol Danvers is maybe just not that likeable. She comes off as a bit cocky, at times, and unidimensional. Her character isn't as developed as I would have liked. Despite this, I did enjoy the plot and origin stories, hence my rating.","

"Captain Marvel","BoshArrow","8 March 2019","I just can't understand the hate towards this nice movie. Yes, it's far from Infinity War, but I feel it's still among top 10 in the MCU. Brie Larson is gorgeus, she did her best and I believe she will fit perfectly in the upcoming movies.
Action scenes on highest level, interesting plot and touching score - Marvel soundtracks continually improve and I think this one is great as well.
'Captain Marvel' is maybe the first movie in which you can actually see more from Nick Fury and understand his vital role for the MCU. Samuel L. Jackson does a decent job and he has a strong supporting role.
Well, I have to say something about the villains in this film - just expect something similar to what happened in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2'.Nice plot twists, interesting investigation and awesome final fight. Don't expect a punching contest like in 'Civil War' or a clever solution like in 'Doctor Strange' - the final battle could be compared to a marvellous inspiration like in 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. The bad guys were actually very interesting and delivered entertainment.
I think 9/10 is fair, 'Captain Marvel' is way better than 'Thor: The Dark World' or 'Ant-man'.","

Performance: Room fame Brie Larson has played role which is larger than life. She was fighter, savior and super hero in single flick. Samuel L Jackson has done good job as a supporting role. Jude Law was impressive in small role. Ben Mendelsohn surprised the audience with his side.
Script: We must appreciate the efforts of director duo along with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve. They have brilliantly linked many mystery in one go. e.g. How Marvel, Avengers words came into existence and why Fury has used Pager in infinity war. They have also mentioned the world at the era of 1990s with slow internet speed. Most unique thing was the way to give tribute to Stan Lee.
Dialogues: Conversion between Brie and Jackson's added fun in the script. Lashana and Brie 's conversation was emotional one.
Box-Office: After opening with 12.75 crores in India, it took another jump on day 2 as it has earned 13.75. It means that it will earn more on Sunday. It will be interesting watch whether it will cross 100 crores mark at Indian Box-Office.

Brie was great, the story wasn't too cookie cutter, and the best Marvel special effects yet. I really liked the plot, a soldier on the wrong side of the war is a classic, and it's done well.On a personal note, this movie friggin rocked. To see my kids faces while they watched, and all the other girls in the theater, it almost brought me to tears. It has such a good message.

"Captain Marvel","fernandoschiavi","28 March 2020","About to end its phase 3 with an ""Ultimatum"", one of the most awaited films of the last decades, Marvel still finds time to introduce new and important characters in its shared universe. In the comics, Carol Danvers, Captain Marvel, debuted in the Silver Age of American comics. The character was featured in a solo series in the late 1970s, before associating with the superhero teams, The Avengers and X-Men, the character was created by screenwriter Roy Thomas and designer Gene Colan. Danvers first appeared as an officer in the United States Air Force and a colleague of superhero kree Mar-Vell in Marvel Super-Heroes # 13 (March 1968). In recent times, Danvers has been labeled ""Marvel's greatest heroine"" and ""possibly"" most powerful Marvel Avengers member. ""
In theaters, ""Captain Marvel"", in addition to being the first Marvel film starring a heroine, is the bridge between ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and the long-awaited ""Avengers: Ultimatum"". Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, and written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet, it stars Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Lashanna Lynch, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Mckenna Grace, Clark Gregg and Jude Law. takes us takes us to before all the other MCU features (except for Captain America: The First Avenger). In 1995, the story follows Danvers when she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien worlds, borrowing elements from screenplay writer Roy Kree-Skrull (1971). Thomas.
For starters, the publisher's homage to his legendary comic artist Stan Lee stands out, putting him in the place of the characters he created in the opening animation of Marvel Studios. Lee passed away in late 2018 and, before that, he even recorded his famous participation in the film, appearing in the scene where the heroine hunts a Skrull in the subway.
Exploring flashes of the past very well, the heroine tries to discover more about her own past, as well as understand and master her powers. Finally, the heroine manages to show a more human facet to the public through the partnership with Nick Fury that generates several situations of comedy that gives lightness to the war by showing it through Fury's still innocent eyes, and also with Maria Rambeau (Lashanna Lynch), which is the heroine's great connection to her past. It is in Maria's memories the memory of facing prejudices as pilots and in the support for the creation of little Monica Rambeau (Akira Akbar). But there are other characters who are doing very well and steal all the scenes they participate in: Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and the cat Goose. Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and Dr. Wendy Lawson / Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) are good assistants.
Because it is a film that takes place decades ago, it is curious to see several of the characters that we get used to accompany, in another moment of life. Ronan the Accuser, who first appeared as the great villain of Guardians of the Galaxy and a lackey for Thanos, appears as the leader of an elite Kree force, the Accusers; Korath is just a Kree soldier; Agent Coulson appears as a young and promising agent and the main highlight is Nick Fury. At the time, he was an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. who, after years as a spy, worked outside the field looking for ways to protect the Earth. He is still inexperienced and had no knowledge of intergalactic issues, let alone superpowered beings. Jackson and Gregg - who, among others, reprise their roles in previous MCU films - were digitally rejuvenated in post-production to reflect the setting of the film in the 90s. And the result couldn't be better: they are of an absurd quality, bordering on the perfection.
One of the main aspects of the feature is the infinity of references not only in relation to the stories of the publisher's comics, but also in the pop culture of the 80s and 90s, where the story predominantly takes place. After escaping the Skrulls, Carol Danvers falls to Earth inside a Blockbuster video store. As the feature takes place in the 1990s, it is possible to see references to classics such as Hook: The Return of the Captain Hook (1991), Babe, the Rough Piggy (1995), True Lies (1994), in addition to The Elected: Where the Future Begins (1983). The musical references are also present, with several references of bands from the 80's and early 90's. She appears with a Guns N 'Roses T-shirt - and finds a ticket to the group's concert, a Bush poster appears when she is on the pay phone, Nine Inch Nails, Heart t-shirts appear, a Smashing Pumpkins poster and even a reference to grunge in the heroine's civilian outfits.
Another reference is Captain Marvel's cat, which in the comics is called Chewie in a reference to Star Wars. In cinema, however, Marvel chose to call him Goose, a direct reference to Anthony Edwards' character in Top Gun: Untamed Aces. It is not, however, a conventional feline. Goose arrived on Earth with Mar-Vell and is an alien of the Flerken race, with internal tentacles and the ability to swallow objects as powerful as the Tesseract. In comics, the breed also has the ability to harbor dimensions within itself, being able to teleport from place to place, in addition to laying numerous eggs. In the film, aware of the threat of Flerken, the Kree gag the creature, in a moment inspired directly by the comics. The film also reveals how Nick Fury lost his eye - a scratch from Goose, and how theories emerged about how he came to use his famous eye patch, with Fury insisting on feeding the aura of mystery around the wound. There is also the fact that Fury was inspired by Danvers to propose to S.H.I.E.L.D. recruiting exceptional individuals to defend the Earth together from unconventional threats, and when he discovers that Danvers was codenamed ""Avenger"" in the Air Force, he names this protocol ""Avengers Initiative"".
Although the film highlights the friend Maria Rambeau, we must pay attention to her daughter. Monica Rambeau in the comics is one of the most powerful heroines in the Marvel Universe, having even been the first woman to use the name Captain Marvel. In 1982, at Amazing Spider-Man Annual # 16, Marvel introduced Monica Rambeau at the hands of Roger Stern and John Romita Jr. as a New Orleans police officer who has the power to transform into any form of energy. As Captain Marvel, she was a member of the Avengers and even led the team. Then he adopted the name Photon (which in the film appears as Maria's nickname in the air force, as shown in the photo above), Pulsar and currently serves as Spectrum. As the film takes place in the 90s, M√¥nica is around 30 years old in the present line of the MCU.
However, the film is not just a nostalgic trip and it has different points. Perhaps due to their lack of experience in running large blockbusters, the duo of directors are unable to shoot action scenes that look spectacular. The prevalence of more closed plans and not so imposing scenarios, fail to give the scenes greater proportions as they should. The feeling is that in the hands of another director, the scenes could be reimagined in the way that worked best on the big screen. In addition to not being grandiose, the scenes are scarce, being almost all restricted to the final act of the story, and were also not helped in many moments by the visual effects team. In several scenes, it is possible to notice the use of CGI in the composition of scenarios, giving an air of artificiality, especially in the final stretch when the heroine fights aerial fights with her powers developed.
The rhythm of the film is a problem with the plot starting relatively at a slower pace, taking time to explain the central conflict - deeper than it appears - and, of course, the protagonist's role in this story. So, gradually, Captain Marvel gains a more intense cadence and it is in her arrival on Earth that the film actually begins to take a more defined form. There is also the issue of the Skrull-Kree war, which is summed up in a very simplistic and incoherent way. We have a little war. In the film, everything is very predictable. From the beginning, one feels that nothing is as it seems, and the real villains can be identified with a mere guessing exercise. However, it is the lack of personality of the antagonists, generic in their plans and worldview, that damage the plot more deeply. Seeing this weak antagonism after figures like Killmonger and especially Thanos is, to say the least, something that lowers the experience to a B or C series within this recent crop.
Long before she was Captain Marvel, Carol was a fearless girl finding her place in a world of men. As a human, she has flaws, but whenever she fell, she got up, tried herself and got everything she wanted. A child, a teenager, a young adult. The transformation into Kree would be the starting point for the character, if her entire past no longer assumed a hero's journey. The feminist subtext, although well implemented, does not reach the depth that racial and cultural themes gained in the film of the hero of Wakanda. And you don't even have to reach it. Issues can be raised for discussion without becoming flags blindly defended by a particular group. Overall, the film follows the late Marvel formula and does not take chances, does not innovate and does not dare, but delivers a fun, nostalgic result and a character that will certainly be one of the leaders of The Avengers in the next films!","

"Captain Marvel","mattpeerless-376-865613","9 March 2019","There are many reviews on here which criticise the lack of spectacle, poor writing, and predictability of this film, however I cannot help feel they're missing the point. We all knew this was 2 things: a setup for Endgame, and Marvel's attempt at a successful lead in answer to DC's Wonder Woman.
In the first, it succeeds. I'm excited to see how Captain Marvel helps solve the problem leftover from Infinity War.
In the second however, it exceeded my expectations entirely. The true beauty of this film is that it's a film made with a feminist agenda by someone who doesn't actually seem to hate men. It's about empowering women by virtue of their own ability; showing what they can achieve simply by themselves, not by patronising them with special treatment.
It also succeeds in showcasing a female superhero without feeling the need to make her a sex symbol in a short skirt/using gratuitous shots of her bottom. Brie Larson looks great throughout, but at no point did I ever feel that was a focus.
Full disclosure - I am a man. If I ever have a daughter, I want films like this to inspire her.","

"Captain Marvel","CubsandCulture","9 March 2019","At this point in the MCU it is rather hard to find surprises. Likewise, origin stories are often very rote and formulaic. That is somewhat true in this film but the decision to set the film in the 90's rather helps. Likewise, the decision to the make the film sort of a origin story for Fury was a good idea. The 90's nostalgia coupled with seeing how the pieces of the MCU fit into this film really liven up this story. I was fond of how the various reveals subverted the expectations. With an antagonist that can be anyone it was great to see how many characters weren't what they initially seemed. Overall, the story is a solid origin tale that fits in with Iron Man, Dr. Strange, the 1st Captain America etc. And hold its own. There are few choice barbs at sexism that are great and adds to the female empowerment of the film in a tasteful way.The acting is quite good. Mendelson plays Talos with relish. He channels the pathos of the character quite well; he was a great choice to play a character that has the audience guessing. Law plays the pseudo-love interest and mentor quite well. His final scene hits the correct note of vindictive and pathetic. It is about time Law was in the MCU. I hope his character remains. Larson plays Captain Marvel with a tom boyish charm but also as a woman who won't suffer fools. I think Larson handles the character's earnestness about as well as one could. Her performance is committed and sincere.However, Captain Marvel, the character, suffers from a Superman problem. The character is as overpowered as Superman and worse as earnest. This characterization is somewhat bland and dramatically flat. But it is refreshing to have such sincerity in a character. I am not sure how future stories can handle this to make the story engaging. The conflict in this film is just enough to up end this problem while watching but I am not sure if the character works beyond wish fulfillment.It is really the detail that make this film very good. That the theme of things aren't what the seem being forwarded by Goose's running gag is a good example. Or how staples of the 90's-grunge, blockbuster, fresh prince etc.-are referenced in a natural way really sell the film.This film fits comfortably within Marvel's average output. It is not the highs of Black Panther, Winter Soldier. But it isn't the lows of the Incredible Hulk, Age of Ultron.EDIT: Enough cannot be said of Fury's and Danvers' chemistry. Re-watching the film today it struck me as a really good buddy-""cop"" film as well as an origin story. Jackson and Lawson play off each other very well and if nothing else the film is worth seeing for this relationship.","

"Captain Marvel","gavinp9","9 March 2019","'Captain Marvel' builds the bridge between 'Avengers: Infinity War' and 'Avengers: Endgame' and does a good job of it. Most of the film works well as the standalone origin story of Carol Danvers (Larson), as she pieces together her past. Starting with her already on the Kree (the blue aliens, as seen in 'Guardians of the Galaxy') home world is smart and saves dealing with the whole aliens on Earth thing. Vers is being trained by Yon-Rogg (Law) and has almost no memory her life on Earth, save some snippets of Lawson (Bening) and Maria (Lynch).After Carol ends up back on Earth, she starts to unravel the mystery of who she is, with the help of Nick Fury (Jackson) and (to a lesser degree) Coulson (Gregg). She reunites with Maria and deciphers that they both used to be pilots - which leads to some good jet battles later on! The main plot though is that Carol is caught in the middle of an intergalactic war between the Kree and the Skrulls (the green aliens, shapeshifters). Talos (Mendelsohn) is a Skrull and does a great job - great to hear his Aussie accent when he's in Skrull form! Ronan (Pace) is back for some scenes, but the other Kree offsiders don't have that much to do.There's still a bit of jigsaw-piecing-together going on (stay for the end credit scene), but when Larson and Jackson are on screen, it's a very solid action/adventure film. There was more laughs than I was expecting, especially with the ""flerken""! It's not 'Thor: Ragnarok', but the 90s film and music references are fun to see/hear. Great to watch Carol's powers develop and the ""twist"" just after halfway through. It's not too long and there's under seven weeks until 'Avengers: Endgame' (likely to be the highest-grossing film ever).","

"Captain Marvel","bogdanbalostin","1 June 2019","It's nothing special in the large scale of things.I've finally seen this movie, after Avengers: Infinity War because I didn't feel I'll miss anything and I was right. There are some stakes there but there are not big because you obviously know Earth will be fine and Captain Marvel will kick ass even if she's not even trying.So, the thing is Marvel has continuously upped their game, so we (or I) expect each movie to be better than the previous one. This one is way better than the first Marvel movies (except the first Iron-man I was bored to tears at most of the Marvel movies, but slowly they got better and better).What I'm saying this movie is not bad at all but suffers because the heroine is invincible. The acting is perfect (yes, I think Brie Larson fits Captain Marvel, don't listen to the negative opinions), I'm so glad we got to see a lot more of Nick Fury (don't call him Nick), and they even added some emotional twists that I really loved to see more in superhero movies.It's a good movie that should have been part of Marvel Phase 4 and have bigger stakes. Maybe that's a job for a sequel. And with Captain Marvel, the stakes should be huge.","

Haters hated black panther because it was filled with black people but the movie was set in africa and now, hater hate captain marvel because it has a female lead and its filled with strong women.

NOT because it's #girlpower but because of the storyline. And I understand now why Fury has that 'pirate cover' on his eye. I really liked the movie and I recommend anyone who follows/like MCU movies to watch it. If you're a fan even better.

"Captain Marvel","richwagener","29 June 2019","I'm a 53 year old life long Marvel fan who bought Ms. Marvel #1 off the newsstand back in the 70s. Once Mar-Vell died in ""The Death of Captain Marvel"", the company struggled to fill the void and maintain the name. So I was really glad when, a few years ago, Carol Danvers got the upgrade in the comics. I just rewatched the film this morning and I still found it moving and compelling. Technically, it's a quality Marvel film. The CGI gets slightly over ambitious in the finale. However, there is absolutely no justification for the low ratings certain ""accounts"" are giving this film except as some kind of weird anti-feminist statement. Some are talking about some kind of conspiracy relating to the IMDB ratings. I think the ""conspiracy"" is more likely trolls with multiple accounts dragging this film's rating far lower than it actually is.","

"Captain Marvel","chrisgavidia","9 March 2019","This film doesn't deserve as much backlash as it's getting from online reviewers....however I can understand the negativity slightly. It did feel like Disney was trying really hard to develop a strong female character using a basic story formula with a slight narrative twist . They had a target audience they were trying to reach and bring into the customer fold to increase revenue for their very well structured MCU and also appear progressive at the same time.Where Gal Gadot succeeded as being a likable heroine with Wonder Woman you cared about and pulled for, Brie Larsons protrayal falls slightly below Gadots unfortunately. Larsons personality resonates and connected with the audience in some scenes, but in others felt very wooden. The producers of Captain Marvel had clear goals they were probably aiming to make with this film to fit into the great whole of the MCU.With all of that said this is still a very entertaining movie and worth seeing with a plot that keeps you wanting to see the next scene and the first tent pole film of 2019 . The interaction between Fury and Carol helps this film significantly and of course the set pieces were very solid.Don't go in expecting a Wonder Woman type film. Set your expectations to what you thought before Ant-Man and Captain America the First Avenger. In no way is this a Fantastic Four or Green Lantern or Iron Man 3 story bad or polarizing as The Last Jedi but the film is a middle of the road MCU film that is worth seeing that falls in with Age of Ultron and Dr. Strange. For sure check it out atleast once.","

Its action is seldom impressive, storytelling is utterly basic, predictable & bereft of surprises, and some key moments are executed in a rather lacklustre fashion. In short, this isn't the origin story that the most powerful superhero in Marvel faction deserves.","

"Captain Marvel","deeptisharma-13839","9 March 2019","Is this a superhero movie? Yes. Is this a great superhero movie? YES. Dont expect it to blow your lid off bcoz you see some cool intergalactic fights (you do see action, which is well choreographed, but leave that aside). What makes this movie a true standout is:
1. Stan Lee's last signature cameo
2. Strong characters - well fleshed out within the limitations of a 2 hour feature
3. Doesn't follow the usual tropes of pleasing male gaze (unfortunately inviting trolls)
4. Strong message - no sexism, strong female character who is unapologetic (men may view it as arrogant), message about perseverance well delivered, strong (and yet not an infallible) role model for little girls, and most importantly - not to judge a book by its cover - which impressed me the most and is the biggest plot twist (hard to say more without giving it away), so go watch it.
Its not a female superhero movie, it is a superhero movie with a strong message, dry humor done right, some great 90s music, and brilliant acting!","

They said ""it shoved feminism down your throat!"" They said ""bad acting!"" They said ""goose is the only good thing about this movie!"" And I believed them. But thank god I had the sense to see it anyways! Going into the theater I was like ""ok show me you what you got marvel"" and they proved me dead wrong!! I don't even know where to begin I am at a literal list for words as there were TOO MANY THINGS GOOD ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!! (I'm not joking when a friend asked ""how was the movie?"" I dididnt know how to properly explain this great piece of entertainment) First of all to clear the air: THIS IS NOT A FEMINIST MOVIE! I repeat This is not a feminist movie! (Btw I am a pure conservative) The media blew this movie way out of proportion about the feminist message. Yes of course there were very subtle hints of it but it's not revolutionary as a feminist piece of art (just because it's has a female lead doesn't make it a feminist legend) The movie start to finish kept me on edge with great story telling and plot twists. Another's thing people are complaing about is braie larson's acting they say she is too bland, but thats the point! HER CHARACTER IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EMOTIONAL! She was actually playing her part perfect. Her character is very reserved and withdrawn to strangers and gradually you see her develop. Samuel L. Jackson was also great ( the secod act of the movie feels like a buddy-cop movie) To end off as the move came to a close the entire theater gave a standing ovation! The atmosphere was full of surprise people were basically saying ""Hey I didn't know it was this good!"" Do yourself a favor, ignore the comments, watch the movie , and decide for yourself what you think about it!","

"Captain Marvel","kermitkid","30 March 2020","This is a perfect example of horrible marketing for a good movie. I wasn't too impressed with the trailers. They were kind of bland. I went into this with my expectations checked at the door, and this movie was above average. It wasn't as boring and uninteresting as the trailers led me to believe, but it still has faults. For an MCU movie, it's average, and for a movie it's above average. The main problem was it tried to hard to be another 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie, but without the risks. ""Guardians"" was a gamble. (A movie about a talking raccoon and a tree?! Marvel has lost their minds!). It tries to capture the wonder of a sci-fi movie, but plays it too safe. There were many factors that I felt didn't go as far as they could have. The plot is pretty paint-by-numbers as well. This movie 'borrows' too much from other films. It didn't feel enough like it's own thing. There were some amusing moments, and one in particular that got a huge laugh out of me, but the film played it too safe. The CGI is pretty impressive. I couldn't tell that the aliens in the movie were CGI. However, when there are scenes of characters flying, it definitely looks CGI, and cheap CGI at that. (Think ""video game trailer."") Larson's acting is not as wooden as the trailers would lead you to believe (most of the time anyway), nor is the character of Captain Marvel as narcissistic and rude as the trailers made her seem. She's nowhere close to my favorite MCU character, but I wouldn't mind seeing her return. I don't know what most of Hollywood has against Ben Mendelssohn's natural accent. Mendelssohn is a terrific actor, but in movies like ""Ready Player One"" and this one where they make him do an American accent, it sounds fake, and is distracting. And no, this movie is not a 2 hour lecture on feminism. Contrary to the marketing, Captain Marvel doesn't put down the male characters (at least not unprovoked.) This movie actually can be enjoyed by anyone. Marvel needs to re-evaluate their marketing team.

"Captain Marvel","RahulM007","10 March 2019","Captain Marvel has one of the best origin stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Granted, it is no where near as good as the origin story of Black Panther which was purely amazing and absolutely flawless. I loved every single scene of the movie and was glued to the screen from start to finish. The phenomenal action scenes, light humor, special effects, dialogue and Brie Larson's acting all make this movie worth your time.It answered a huge question regarding Nick Fury of how he lost his eye. The scene where this happens was not traditional nor obvious. As a matter of fact, Agent Fury lost his eye at the end of the colossal intergalactic fight scene. He trusted Goose the Cat and thought it was harmless, but his assumptions were so wrong. Apparently the cat is from another planet and devours anything it does not like or makes them feel insecure. Agent Fury held the cat and it scratched his eye out. The scene is quite humorous and one of the best scenes in the entire movie.Captain Marvel has two post credit scenes (a mid and end credits scene) that take place in the past and present. The first one takes place after the events of Infinity war with the surviving members of the Avengers deciphering the message Agent Fury sent after he turned into dust. The scene ends with Captain Marvel showing up and asks Where's Fury?. While the second one takes place in the past and features Goose the Cat trying to spit out the Tesseract. Both of these scenes especially the first one puts me in a nostalgic mood and gets me even more excited for Avengers: Endgame.The movie tried to tell the origin story of Captain Marvel in an exciting and unique way and in my opinion it delivered. I admit that some scenes were confusing, but that does not hinder the fact that Captain Marvel is one of my all time favorite MCU movies. The scenes where Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel had memory flashes were a little confusing for the audience, but the rest of the movie makes up for it.To conclude, Captain Marvel is a great movie to watch before Avengers: Endgame. I loved the scenes between Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson). They portrayed these characters perfectly. Can't wait to see Captain Marvel in Avengers: Endgame, now that she is the most powerful Avenger.","

"Captain Marvel","illuminatilights01","16 June 2019","I wasn't familiar with Captain Marvel like I was with the more popular Avenger characters (had the comics as a kid, action figures, etc.) so I don't have the esoteric background to complain about what they didn't do right for the film.I also believe that a film should be viewed for what it is, the characters in it, not whatever issues you have with the actors/ actresses in real life.So starting off, I wasn't very much interested in Captain Marvel because I wasn't familiar with the story, same thing about Ant Man, same about Black Panther. Then all of complaining from males about Larson's comments and whatever reviews, biased or not that came from it pushed my expectations even further down whether or not they were written with vitriol for the actress.So I was a bit taken aback by the opening of it - you just straight into the S#*T, and without any background info, I was a bit like, ""what the hell is going on?"" but you find out what you need to know fairly quickly and Danver's isn't the most lovable character from jump street but she grows on you - much like a person with that personality type would probably do in real life.The story line unfolds differently from other Marvel movies and while there were some parts during it when I was questioning it, after finishing it, I can say that it was a refreshing way of story telling and directing that I really liked, especially from Marvel.They only thing I didn't like was not much explanation of what her power can actually do. She is blasting through reinforced cement and state of the art spaceships with ease but then when she shoots ""people"" it just knocks them around? C'mon stop nerfing, Disney!And it was great to get the Nick Fury backstory, especially his personality.","

"Captain Marvel","Drabble500","8 March 2019","This is a terrific multi-layered film that isn't without some problems. Knowing the MCU I was quite surprised by the turn of events.So Captain Marvel isn't Kree after all. Her super power source is therefore slightly confusing. We know that on the one hand it comes from the energy core that consumed her. On the other hand, what makes her different is that, er, she's human. That's an intriguing idea but slightly problematic.Brie did a great job. She's fairly restrained emotionally and the film does the opposite to the normal MCU format: with this one she starts with power and then we get flashbacks. She's also not your typical kickass female lead like for example Angelina Jolie or Daisy Ridley but that's probably really refreshing. I hope in real life she doesn't feel she has to emulate those types. Part of the appeal of this film is precisely the above point: you see her standing after she's fallen. She's a vulnerable girl who nevertheless picks herself up. Macho guys or T-fuelled posturisers who are used to Thor and Thanos aren't going to much warm to that kind of feminine hero but that's always been the thing about MCU: it breaks your conventional mould. Makes you rethink your meme.In some ways, my biggest problem, then, comes towards the end when we see this all-supreme Captain Marvel zooming into space (without even needing a helmet). It's a long way removed from the little girl lost theme. I'm not totally sure where MCU goes from that because the finale, where she meets the Avengers, is surely going to lead to Thanos getting his sorry butt kicked and, erm, that's it.Anyway, it's a great film. Some real laughs. Brie is great so are Lashana Lynch and Annette Bening. But the true stars of the film are probably Samuel L. Jackson and ... the cat. No, seriously.","

"Captain Marvel","sebastiansallingkierkegaard","12 March 2019","""Captain Marvel"" is not perfect in any way, but it's fun and entertaining. I think Beer Larson is great as Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers. Samuel L. Jackson is also great as always. The humour is spot on, and the score by Pinar Topeka is fantastic! I think this is a great movie in the MCU, no matters the controversy surrounding it!","

"Captain Marvel","paul-2369","30 May 2019","First of all I'm not a Marvel fanboy, I've not seen a number of marvel films, not yet seen infinity war, endgame. It was my son what told me to watch this movie saying i didn't need to see other marvel films, he watched at the cinema when it first came out and then watched it again with me for a second time.I do however remember at lot of negative reviews on social media, and there are lot's of 1 star reviews on here. So I thought I wouldn't enjoy it...I was expecting long drawn out pointless fight scenes, predictable characters and no story, not one I ""a none fanboy"" could follow anyway. What i got was the opposite; an enjoyable thrill ride with a great story, great characters, and interesting plot twists... I thoroughly enjoyed It, did I see a different movie to these trashers?What the hell is wrong with people....","

"Captain Marvel","stevendbeard","9 March 2019","I saw ""Captain Marvel"", starring Brie Larson-Kong:Skull Island, 21 Jump Street_2012; Samuel L. Jackson-Glass, Kong:Skull Island; Ben Mendelsohn-Robin Hood_2018, The Dark Knight Rises; Jude Law-Fantastic Beasts:The Crimes of Grindelwald, Spy and Annette Bening-Rules Don't Apply, Open Range.
This movie is based on the Marvel comic book character, not the original Captain Marvel that is now being published by DC comics-he goes by the name of Shazam ever since they lost the name rites to Marvel's character, but that's another story. Brie plays Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel. The movie is set in 1995 and you learn through flashbacks and memories her origin story. Samuel is Nick Fury and he-as well as another actor-is de_aged digitally so that he looks younger and he has both of his eyes. You do learn what happened that made him wear the eye patch-at least according to the MCU, aka Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's not the same as in the original comics. Story wise, there is a big galactic war going on between two alien races called the Kree and the Skrulls. Jude is the Kree soldier that trained Brie and Ben is the leader of the Skrulls, a shape_shifting race. Annette plays the Supreme Intelligence, an A.I. that gives the Kree their marching orders. Both races are competing to find a certain item of power and it just so happens to be hidden on Earth, so there is plenty of action to go around. I remember hearing some music by No Doubt and Nirvana among some others. The opening Marvel Studios logo-the one that usually shows lots of different Marvel characters-is a little different, focusing on only one person, and it is not Captain Marvel. Stan Lee has his usual brief cameo-filmed before he died in 2018-and I've heard he will have his last one in the Avengers End Game. There are two scenes as the end credits start; one is right after the credits start, and it includes several Avengers and it is connected to the Infinity War and the other one is at the very end and it is comical, involving a character named Goose.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci fi violence & action and some mild language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.
It was a little confusing at times, because of the flashbacks and memory scenes but it did make sense in the end.
Overall, I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

"Captain Marvel","evgenycaruana","10 March 2019","Intro...So, Captain Marvel, the cosmic warrior hero that is the one to join the Avengers for Endgame, surprised me quite a bit.Getting into my review...The movie was good yes but it was flawed at certain parts such as the last part (spoiler) where Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers flies in space without her cool helmet... cringeworthy in my opinion, not a good way to end the movie.There were parts in the movie that were hilarious and I loved seeing Goose kicking ass with the tentacles shooting out! The cat was cute and adorable AF!Nick Fury was my favourite character in this movie, he didn't look as if CGI was being used on him, which is frikkin awesome, and his humor was on point. The buddy-cop comedy in my opinion worked in this movie. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson rocked on screen with their sassy humor and their chemistry just worked!Conclusion...On a final note, I was in tears when they showed a tribute for Stan Lee and when he appeared in the cameo on the train.Was the movie good or bad?Yes the movie was good and it is definitely worth the watch! I can't wait to see what they do with Captain Marvel in Endgame!","

"Captain Marvel","view_and_review","11 March 2019","Marvel is a victim of its own success. They've been so good for so long that perfection is expected with every release. Their brand name now rivals the likes of Apple, Nike, or Coke. Slapping ""Marvel"" on a movie means $100M or more.
That's not to say that they don't have to try, it's just to say that they don't have to try as hard. So, I don't say that they didn't try with Captain Marvel, I just don't think they gave their best effort.With 19 years of Marvel movies it's hard to bring along a superhero that's going to wow people. Of course there are the Marvel faithfuls that would be pleased with anything that has Marvel's name on it but for those others--what's left? After a Spider-Man, the X-Men, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Blade, Ant-Man, Black Panther, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and a host of supporting characters even a Captain Marvel seems tame. And let's be honest, how many of us saw this movie because it's attached to The Avengers: End Game?If I broke down my reasons for seeing Captain Marvel I'd say 50% because it's a Marvel movie, 40% because it's attached to The Avengers, and 10% because it's a superhero movie.At this point it's not simply about powers anymore. Sure, the superpowers are cool but they can only take a movie so far. The story needs to be good and the lead character needs to be even better. I found Brie Larson dull. Besides fitting the look needed she offered nothing. She failed to distinguish herself in a world of distinguished superheros.Marvel can easily absorb this loss and truthfully I'm probably in the minority by calling this a loss. IMO Captain Marvel didn't thrive on its own--much like Hulk didn't thrive on its own--not a problem, lets see how she does working with a team.","

"Captain Marvel","TheJohnnyPHreak","9 March 2019","It's been almost three years since it was announced that Brie Larson was announced at Comic-Con to be playing the role of Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel. I had been waiting for the announcement for a while. I'm pretty close to being a die hard fanboy for Captain Marvel. When I became more of an adult and really got into comics, I don't know what it was but she appealed to me. Her character was the headstrong, powerful, smart military type that always kept things grounded emotionally. She is kind of like the equivalent of Superman for the Marvel Universe. But human and also even if she didn't have powers she would be a badass pilot. When the film and the date were released I was counting down the days. I couldn't wait to see this character I enjoyed so much on the page on the big screen.Here's the thing, I wasn't a fan of Brie Larson as a choice. I was hoping for Yvonne Strahovski (Chuck, 24) or Natalie Dormer (Game of Thrones). I was a bit confused with the choice of Brie Larson. Outside of the coming off her Academy Award win, I'm not sure what they thought. But that was just my opinion. Time went by and I don't know if I just forgot being upset about the casting or what, but when I saw those first leaked set photos I was very happy. Then I saw all the research and work she was putting into being Captain Marvel and it started putting me at ease. The first trailer was a bit hit or miss for me. With each trailer, my excitement for this film grew to a fever pitch. This film had become one of my most anticipated films of 2019 (top five at least). I am happy to report this is exactly the Captain Marvel film I wanted and have been waiting for.The quick rundown of the plot of the film is Vers (Larson) is a warrior with the Kree. The Kree who feature Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and Korath (Djimon Hounsou) have enemies with the Skrulls, shape-shifting alien species whose small faction in the film is lead by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn). When on an exaction mission Vers is caught by Skrulls and probed for information. This leads to memories that she can't put together. She escapes captivity and is hurled to Earth. Teaming up with a young Agent Nicolas J Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and young Agent Phil Coulson, Vers must figure out what all these memories mean and stop the on-coming Skrull/Kree war that is coming to earth.Brie Larson embodies Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. She's so cocky, funny, headstrong at times, but selfless and full of heart. I honestly couldn't have picked a better actress to play her. I don't know how Marvel does it but they really do get the best actors and actress to portray their characters. Samuel L. Jackson seems to be having the most fun playing Fury in any of the MCU films he's been in. This is young Fury, who isn't the hardcore spy with mountains of secrets and a grizzled closed-off demeanor. This happens to be his first encounter with alien beings and he plays with it so well. Also, who knew Fury was a cat person. (More on that amazing cat later) Jude Law is a good leader/foil for Danvers. He's pushing her to be the best she can be but in a poke/prod the bear way. He has things he's hiding from her and when he needs to ruthless he pulls it off very well.Ben Mendelsohn is probably the human that steals the most scenes. He knows he's in a superhero Marvel movie and proceeds to play the film just right. I'm very happy we get a multilayered villain that could be around for the future. Even the FX and makeup, he's excellent in his character. Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau might be the heart of the film. Her chemistry with Larson is so on point, one could think they've been friends for years off-screen. Rambeau keeps Danvers grounded. The love they have for each other is something that never goes away. She is family for Danvers and that pops off the screen. But the one scene stealer of them all is Goose the Cat. (Chewie in the comics, why they changed I'll never understand) Anytime Goose is on screen he commands attention. He has pretty decent chemistry with Fury and a few surprises to boot.Casting wise, the whole film is full of good performances. I was happy to see Annette Bening in the role(s) she was cast. They are important to the film and history of Captain Marvel. The film is so very sci-fi and I really enjoyed that. I know that Guardians Of The Galaxy is like a character-driven space opera but this film elements of Star Wars and Superman. It's very cool to see the MCU diving into their comic book roots and go all out sci-fi with their last few films. There's a lot of tech talk, aliens, superpowers and cool space travel. The action is good. The train fight/chase being the standout but I did enjoy the end space battle showing off how powerful Captain Marvel really is.Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck get the small character moments so perfect. Not that I have any issues with the action but I think with a second feature they will get their sea legs and give us something truly eye-popping on the scale that Captain Marvel deserves. That would be my only issues is that there is a really standout action set piece that screams ""wow did you see that?!"" Everything for me worked so well. And they connect this film to the bigger MCU picture like a piece in a big puzzle. There are more questions that are raised that aren't answered yet. Hopefully in a sequel and Avengers: Endgame we will get some of those answers.Captain Marvel was a total blast for me. The film does start off a bit slow but once Carol gets to Earth the film takes off in all the best ways. It's much like the opposite of the original Thor. Everything on Asgard was great but him on Earth was a bit underwhelming. All the performances were excellent and it seemed the entire cast was having so much fun playing their roles and being in this film. The story is basically Marvel's Superman story. I also see this as a film that demands multiple viewings. I can't wait to see the film again and see how Captain Marvel fits into Endgame and beyond. For the viewers that don't know there are two after credit scenes that people following this film series need to stay for.","

The movie is awesome I do believe Brie, plays really good her part of vers/Carol Danvers, the role seems to demand a great deal of physical action in which she demonstrated that she very fit and trained hard for her role.
I also love other actors such as Samuel L Jackson, he was the comedy relief portion at least with me he was a fresh of breath air. I also loved Clark Greg from ""The agents of the shield"" Coulson. One more let's not forget Annette Bening she was great I had never seen her in this type of role . Jude law is magnificent and impressive but I usually love him.

"Captain Marvel","gazzalodi","9 March 2019","What's really good is that most of the spoilers that I saw on the internet before this was released were wrong about so much. A few good twists for the comic readers. The tribute to Stan Lee was very well done.I have read people bashing it as some kind of feminist indoctrination movie. It's not. It also gets bashed for being formulaic. It is. Marvel knows the formula that works for their origin stories and sticks with it here. I don't see that as a bad thing. I enjoy seeing the 'before they were awesome' stories.It's standard superhero fare. Better than most out there, but not top tier. It stands up well to Wonder Woman and Black Panther, better than the second and third Iron Mans, easily outclasses Age of Ultron, BvS and Justice League, not as good as Winter Soldier or Civil War in my opinion.Brie Larson is a very good actress but at times she seems to still be figuring out how the Marvel Cinematic Universe runs. Overall she's very good in the part. The 'empowering' scenes that seem to cause so much grief actually make sense in the context of her character. It's not a 'girls rule' thing, it's a kid who won't give up thing, kind of the same kid with a heart build up that Steve Rogers got. Her gender is not played up much at all, which is actually pretty neat. She's presented without trying to make excuses for her being a woman, much the same way guy superheros don't need to make an excuse for being a guy.Samuel L. Jackson does have a large role. I was expecting just a few shots of him here and there, but the movie also plays as a Nick Fury background-but-not-origin story. With a little Phil Coulson introduction to boot.Overall, worth the 20 bucks for me an my son to go watch, but not a repeat viewing in the theater film.","

"Captain Marvel","kjnorman","10 March 2019","After some of the reviews here you would think that this movie is a turd. I was close to canceling my tickets and skipping it but my kids still wanted to go. Consequently I went in with low expectations. You know what, I was pleasantly surprised! I found it an enjoyable use of two hours and I was engaged the entire time.I'm not invested in Marvel comics but I have seen all the Marvel films. I watched it on how it stood up as a movie with no prior conceived notions as to what this character should be.I see many complaints about the film being boring. I'm not sure what movie those reviewers saw. I found how Brie Larsen played Vers to be appropriate for what we discover her Kree background to be; ""show no emotion"". After she lands on Earth we see her begin to discover who she really is and who is really the enemy. I found the twist to be a surprise (for me) and the way it was handled well done.Weaknesses? I can see the argument that Captain Marvel not having (an apparent) weakness to be something that may reduce the tension in the movie but our family never felt that. If you are someone that wants two hours of battle than perhaps you will be bored. But if you want more beyond a CGI-fest then I think there is a lot to be pleased about in this movie. Yes there are contrived conveniences but hey, it's a Marvel movie; they all have them. Is it logical? No. Is it fun, keeps you engaged for two hours? Yes. There have been other Marvel movies where I get bored with endless fights scenes (cough, cough Black Panther..) This one did not have that and for that I am thankful.","

The cat, as many people have pointed out, is the best, but for me also the music was very on point, especially that action scene with No Doubt's Just a Girl playing.

"Captain Marvel","hdog-94019","9 March 2019","I am not one to usually write reviews, but I feel it is necessary with all the hate surrounding Captain Marvel.
It has been a while since I genuinely enjoyed a Marvel movie. The last one was Logan, which I think we can all agree that was one of the best things produced by Marvel thus far.
I honestly did not think Wonder Woman was amazing (maybe a 7?). However, I am all for female empowerment. Captain Marvel was exactly that: female empowerment, but in the best way possible. It didn't have a political agenda at all. It did not promote a feminist view. I was worried Larson's acting would have been lacklustre due to the previews, and some of the lines in the movie were pretty iffy. I was also worried that she would be a total Mary-Sue, but I was completely wrong. There was no lame romance (even though I am hoping that Carol will end up sapphic. She has to follow in Ms. Blanchett's footsteps, right?) to take away from the action: aka Hulk and Widow.
Unlike Infinity War, this movie did not try to pack too many things in at once. I thought it told a complete story, which is what I look for in movies. I don't like the set up for a sequel, even though Marvel clearly intends to add on to her character. Don't knock it until you watch it!","

"Captain Marvel","rdoubleoc","2 June 2019","Awesome soundtrack, and Brie Larson is a hottie.That being said, I really look forward to good new super hero origin stories, and was really looking forward to this one, but maybe that's why I thought it could be a little better. It's not a bad movie by any means, but just doesn't seem ""polished"" enough for a 150 million dollar budget (75mil, or even 100mil, I could easily understand). I know things are expensive, but for that money I expected something a little more exciting and thrilling. This movie has very good parts, but it just isn't like Final Destination or Jurassic Park movies (with similar budgets) where certain parts would literally make your heart pulse faster and make you think ""Oh, geez... Wow. That's nuts!"". Cloaked space lab was cool, but that's the only unique/special plot element besides the cat? We've made people look younger before, even though maybe not that accurately. Captain Marvel is a cool superhero, nonetheless, maybe even one of my favorites.Fight scene during ""I'm Just a Girl"" was pretty good.Good movie, but just isn't going to be one that I go and tell people about first thing tomorrow. Maybe I've been spoiled by Hollywood, but I just expected a little more for that kind of budget. Captain Marvel is one of my top favorite superheroes now, however.My top liked superheroes from Marvel:
1. Venom
2. Ant-Man
3. Captain Marvel2 and 3 are maybe a tie.","

It's full of action, the story is interesting, the Kree/Scrull plot ties it to the galactic world of Guardians & Shield's last season. I felt the acting was good & Brie gave a convincing performance of a person without memories, and trained to suppress her emotions. The 90s setting was cool, the humour mostly well placed, and Goose is the new Avengers star","

"Captain Marvel","lukasvw-80-315156","9 March 2019","It feels like all reviews follow some sort of agenda. Either you worship a movie because it shows a strong female lead, or you hate it because of it.So, i will entirely focus on the movie, its place within the MCU and the quality of the story, acting, animations and so on.First of all: This movie isn't bad.
But it isn't great either.Neither was Thor the Dark World, but still nobody says Chris Hemsworth is a bad actor.This movie has his reasons to be there. And its not the worst and definitely not the best marvel movie. There seems not to be any feminist agenda within this movie - Captain Marvel is a woman - so its a bit more for the female audience than other MCU movies. But to call this movie some sort of feminazi worshipping you need to be a very insecure little boy.The acting isn't all bad. The jokes are sometimes good, sometimes very good, somtimes lame. There are some good CGI and some really bad (i'm not sure if its just looks bad, or if it looks as it should...)The story is fast and fills more like a filler episode before the big ""finale"" in Endgame. But thats ok. Those fillers are there for a reason. They provide some background information - and thats a good thing.So, if your reproductive organ is longer than your little finger and you are a fan of the MCU, you will enjoy this movie - but probably never watch it twice.","

"Captain Marvel","kerlen_andrea","8 March 2019","I really enjoyed watching this movie and I've seen quite a lot of superhero action movies over the past ten years and more.
Right at the beginning, there is a nice hommage to Stan Lee and there is also a cameo later.
The protagonist is a strong and sympathetic character and she is played really well by Brie Larson. Like most other superheroes her main choice of problem solving is by violent means but in between her actions also hints at the powerful message to never give up and stand up again (and again) no matter what odds are against you.
She is accompanied by some other strong characters too, i.e. she gets joined by Nick Fury. The setting is in 1995, so here we see a younger Nick Fury and also Agent Coulson, both already working for S.H.I.E.L.D yet in different positions than later. We also get a soundtrack full of hits of the Nineties, like Nirvana, Garbage, TLC and others. The original soundtrack was not overwhelming yet okay. If you see the movie, wait until the end to see two short extra scenes, one of them hinting at ""Marvel's The Avengers: Endgame""I won't tell anything about the plot in order to avoid spoilers. The weaknesses I see in the movie are these two:
1. One might argue that Captain Marvel is so powerful that she seems a bit like a Mary Sue. However she has at least one flaw, because she often looses her temper quite quickly and has problem controlling her powers and her impulses, at least at the beginning. Maybe another or a different character flaw would have been a good idea yet I don't how the character is presented in the comics. Maybe she is just meant to be so powerful and with little flaws - and I can completely live with that.
2. Due to a lot of flashbacks the structure of a story seems a bit like a puzzle. The story keeps going back and forth in time which makes it a bit difficult to watch at some points especially because you keep wondering what is going on - like the protagonist does as well. However, finally everything falls into place when the plot twist is revealed and the action is heading to the showdown.","

"Captain Marvel","thesar-2","10 March 2019","God, I love Brie Larson. Loved her in Scott Pilgrim and absolutely agreed with her Oscar for Room. So what the bleep happened here?It is hard to think back to the many, MANY superheroes of the past couple of decades to find a superhero SO plain, SO boring, SO shallow, SO lifeless and without a bit of soul or personality as Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. I had to check to see if George Lucas directed this, because I definitely saw the female Anakin Skywalker here.She was so bad, or her character, at least, she took me completely out of the movie. I never once rooted for her, couldn't care less about her plight and frankly was just waiting for her to end up right where I knew she would thanks to the third Avengers movie. And that's sad, because the movie isn't necessarily a bad one...it's just the title character had none of that Marvel as suggested.Erasing the bore, I loved how the movie was shot. Set in the mid-90s, it, of course, had a kick-ass 90s soundtrack (all of my favorites!!) and the familiar technology and stores from back then. But, bypassing that, the movie FELT like it was shot, edited, paced and scripted like it was from the 1990s. I totally felt transported back to my favorite decade and I praise this movie for that.In a rather quick and easy to follow setup, we learn our title character wants to join an elite group of alien warriors hell-bent on stopping shapeshifters from destroying their protected worlds. Naturally, the one focused on in the movie is Earth and there, our ""hero"" has to track the shapeshifters with no other than Nick ""call him"" Fury.Sadly, the movie is predictable from minute one and this is not just because it ties into many other MCU films. Normally, that would bother me, but again, the filmmaking all felt really 90s to me, so I'm pretty familiar with the old formulas.Only a select handful of jokes landed, mostly from Sam Jackson and the special effects were good, not great. Too many of the older actors looked fake as younger versions of themselves. Despite that, it was so nice seeing Annette Bening again. It's been far too long.I didn't hate the movie, but will only give it a VERY mild recommendation. If Captain Marvel/Brie Larson wasn't so incredibly and painfully dull, we would've had a MUCH BETTER Marvel outing. It even ended somewhat solidly for her, but not enough to make up for the previous 2-hours of sleepwalking she did.***Final thoughts: Admirable on the opening Marvel Logo and the 1st post-credit scene: totally worth it, especially since it's only 1-2 minutes into the 20-minute end credits. You can absolutely skip the last post-credit scene and just Google it when you get home.","

Carol Danvers story is really well put together and how she is shown growing into her powers and her abilities is good. The battle with the Skrulls and Kree throws some interesting jabs at you and how it all comes together is cool. My only grievance is how that big battle scene is a bit dark per the environment it was in but I would have enjoyed it a bit lighter to see more of the scenes.","

Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson and the rest of the cast are superb in my eyes. A great deal of humour chucked in also and the action is spot on. No idea where the hate for Brie comes from but from a neutral, I thought her performance was spot on. Very very good CGI (as we have come to expect) and it sets it all up nicely for what is to come in April.
Two end credit scenes, so stay in your seats, as they are worth it (no spoiler) and please ignore the rather bizzarre 1/10 ratings. Not even sure if they watched it. See for yourself and you will not be disappointed.","

"Captain Marvel","TheHonestCritic","10 March 2019","I just saw the movie: ""Captain Marvel"" (2019), written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. Starring Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and more! All I can say is; this movie took me by surprise. I went in ready to hate this movie and be bored with it, but I thought it was great! Ignore the haters and feminist comments you hear all over the internet, all of that is totally unnecessary. Just because the lead superhero in a movie is a woman does not mean the film can't be good. Any way, back to the review. This movie was a joy from beginning to end! The story may have been just another superhero origin story, but it was told in a fresh and unique way. Although, the first ten minutes kind of dragged, the rest of the story was excellent. The acting was also great. However, the one actor I was skeptical about was Brie Larson. I was worried that she might be too dull and wooden. But, she put on a great performance, as did the rest of the cast! She is perfect for the Captain Marvel character. The sets/locations were good, atmosphere in a film is one of the biggest factors. Do I even need to praise the special effects? Most special effects in modern movies and TV shows are usually a given. All of the special effects in this film were great, especially the de-aging effect for actors Samuel L. Jackson, and Clark Gregg. They really did look 20 years younger! That was really well done, and I was really impressed with the result. Props to the editing team! Probably the only flaw in this film is the soundtrack, it is good for the most part. However, it bounces all over the place, for example: it doesn't stick to any particular tone during the movie. Granted, I do love 1990's music, but the layout of the film score just seemed a little jumbled. Now a soundtrack like that can work when in the proper movie, but it doesn't work here. This was a very fun and exciting film, and I can't wait to see it again! It may not be as excellent as some of the other Marvel movies, and it's definitely not nearly as mind-blowing as ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", or ""Avengers: Infinity War"". But still, it's certainly worth watching in theaters, and buying on DVD. I give this film a 4 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Captain Marvel"" yet, you should go check it out. I hope you enjoyed my review for this movie!","

"Captain Marvel","LBarlane24","19 February 2020","As you may know, I've covered CM before. And having done so, I actually found myself to enjoy, unlike most of the mass majority. That being said, I'm sorry to say that I still had a lot of fun watching it upon second viewing. And the reason I'm covering it again is because of the endless comparison between it and another superhero movie that came out two years earlier, but I'll get to that in a little bit.Now before I begin, it is necessary for me to address the elephant in the room. The main star (that of course being Brie Larson) has received endless backlash for some ... comments that she made a while back. Since then, the actress's reputation has been in boiling hot water, with people across the internet (cough right-wing cough) chastising her; some have even gone out of their way to mocking her.I, as a conservative white male, really couldn't care less about the mediocre impressions Larson has made in recent years. Sure, technically she verbally attacked a massive group of people. But must I remind everyone that it was only that one time? I assure you all that Brie Larson does not Hate ""white men"" and everyone (left and right) should know this.Now with all of that being said, let me flat-out say that Brie Larson KILLED IT as the titular character. She was assertive, a wise-cracker, and took no nonsense from anyone. Many of said that Larson lacked emotion which is flat-out BS if you ask me. 1. Perhaps everyone focused to much on her facial expressions and not enough on the expressions from her EYES. 2. The character was told on multiple occasions by Jude Law's character, Yon-Rogg, that it was necessary to shelf all forms of emotion, as I recall it being a code of theirs.Samuel L. Jackson was fine as Nick Fury, but he was not as great as he was in all the previous films. The gripe that I had was that he seemed to be played mostly for comic-relief. Many have also taken issue on the fashion in which he loses his eye. I (no pun intended), on the other hand, didn't mind it all that much. The thing is though, Fury said in CA: Winter Soldier, and I quote ""Last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye."" I guess some (if not most, including me) assumed that it'd be in a more SERIOUS fashion. But surprisingly enough, that wasn't exactly the case; spoiler, Fury gets clawed by Goose.I've seen a lot of reviews saying that the movie was boring. Yeah, next you'll be telling me that Ad Astra was ENTERTAINING. There are also reviews saying that there was little to no character development. Um ... did you people even WATCH the damn film!? There have even appeared to be reviews saying that Carol Danvers is a Mary Sue ... Yeah, allow me to go over this, and I quate, ""Mary Sue is a term used to describe a fictional character, usually female, who is seen as too perfect and almost boring for lack of flaws."" Now what flaws does Carol Danvers have exactly? Well at the start of the film, she is basically the odd one out, being held back and ridiculed constantly by her ""mentor"" Yong-Rogg. Even after arriving on Earth, she is gawked at by numerous bystanders. She is powerful alright. But for the majority of the film, she has slight trouble controlling said power.The point is that Captain Marvel has been condemned moviegoers for all the wrong reason, while Wonder Woman was flat-out PRAISED for all the wrong reasons. There have also been people comparing Brie Larson to Gal Gadot; specifically, the majority of them pretty much favor Gadot over Larson. Let me just say what the difference is between the two is that Brie Larson is an actress while Gal Gadot is a model. Larson might not be as attractive as Gadot, but she has been acting since she was at least 7-years old. Gadot, despite having served in the military, has been ""acting"" for only about 15 years, and her assets are nothing more than physical.Overall, Captain Marvel is an underrated gem, and the fact that people all over the internet call it inferior to Wonder Woman drives me nuts. It may not be great, but it is nowhere near to being a bad film, and hopefully it'll gain more respect in the future.","

"Captain Marvel","nate-car","14 March 2019","The 21st in an ongoing storyline, of a 20 run movie streak, & a month before the most anticipated movie of all time (Avengers 4), this movie was ALWAYS GOING TO MAKE MONEY...But could the film makers deliver a quality movie when they are so caught up in gender, identity & social justice politics?
Sadly... no.I loved Jude Law & his Kree team in this movie. Gemma Chan was melt in your mouth & STILL break a tooth cool! I could easily have watched a good movie about these guys, (called Kree/Skrull War?)... not what we got though.Brie Larson as Captain Marvel looked sad, uncomfortable, awkward & angry the entire movie. Her appearance did not look heroic, any Captain Marvel cosplay I have seen looked better than her, & it never looked like she enjoyed the role or costume.Nick Fury the character, in almost half the MCU movies is ruined in this movie, & his origin & that of his infamous missing eye is thrown out for cheap laughs, that fell completely flat. For him to get his eye scratched out by a ridiculous MCGUFFIN is film heresy, & the writers should never work in film again.The Skrulls first outing & origin is also ruined in this film. For 57 years in comics & cartoons, they have been the coolest & bad-ass enemies of the Fantastic Four, X-Men & Avengers. But in this movie for a social commentary they are made into sympathetic refugees (2/3s into the movie?) & ruin any chance of telling some of the greatest stories in the MCU.Captain Marvels powers were completely inconsistent the entire movie also, sometimes she could be beaten by Jude Law, or normal humans, or an average Skrull, & her photon blasts were just that, a lame light show that mostly did nothing? Also, CM received her powers from the cosmic cube being shot at, but Jude Law was ALSO caught in the blast & received a concussion instead? Bad writing...Over all, I gave this movie a 3 or 4 out of 10 for 2/3 of the movie & watched it reluctantly entertained... until the final 1/3 when it completely $hit the bed. The ending was so poorly written & executed it went down to a 2/10 with absolutely NO chance of redemption.

Brie Larson is perfect in her role and she justified the role. They said this movie is made for Captain Marvel's entry in Avengers End Game, but in End Game she has very little role and not effective as it should be. Such powerful character must have bigger role in End Game. As me captain Marvel is better that Black Widow. We also got the reason here of why Fury's one eye covered in Avengers' series. Must watchable for Marvel lovers. I do not understand why so negative reviews here for such good movie and I strongly oppose to them who hated it.

And these nothing losers have every right to be scared. This movie is all about not putting up with the gaslighting from empty husks trying to control you. Get knocked down 10 times get up 11. And then punch that loser into next week.If you are not someone suffering from fragile masculinity, you will love this movie,",NA
"Captain Marvel","sheyennednns","9 March 2019","I'm a big fan of marvel movies but it usually takes me a minute to think of my favorite one. After seeing this I don't have that problem anymore, Captain Marvel is the best marvel movie yet. I loved this movie so much that I'm seriously thinking about going to see it again. This movie has me really excited about Endgame ... CAN'T WAIT!!!!!",NA
"Captain Marvel","ayoreinf","10 March 2019","This is a good movie. It has good story, good actors, all around, with the leading couple realy shining through. Namely Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson both build wonderful roles, have great chemistry together, and make us believe them and care for them. You can't ask for more from any actor or actress. There are a few faults in the basic premise, that is, since Captain Marvel is set to be the saviour of the univers, she's made way too powerful, they even make her do a Superman style stunt, which I won't speak about since I don't do spoilers. But that's a fault I already discussed when I wrote my review for the last Avengers installment. As far as I'm concerned the fault was made then, and now they have to live with it. But everything else works just fine here.And still, there's pouring hate against it. So many people say it's a bad movie, it's bland, boring and I could mention worse names stuck to this movie. And I just saw it, with many others and none complained, in fact they all seemed to have fun. So I was wondering where does all this hate come from, and I can't avoid the conclusion that too many people here feel like they have to fight against the onslaught of raging faminism. As far as I'm concerned, this is so silly I think of all the hate my review is bound to get here as my personal budge of honor.Botom line: It's a good movie, a good introduction of a superhroine that suffers from a problematic starting point, due to no fault of the creative team of this movie. In fact I'm much more worried thinking how will Avengers Endgame team handle this impossible starting point. But in this case they did all they can, and they came up with a real fun movie.",NA
"Captain Marvel","Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","11 March 2019","I did not expect that this movie is gonna be that good.
I think the thing that amazed me the most is Captain Marvel actress Brie Larson who just makes everything look so natural, also she's quite beautiful. The camera work is great and shows every actor in their best appearance which helps. Also visual effects does not make the movie uglier, but actually truly enchances the experience, it doesn't look fake. Classic Marvel.It's pretty cool that I from the beginning was thinking that possibly the Kree are the villains. Actually I thought maybe even Captain Marvel is a villain, but she's not, only her colleagues.
The plot is interesting, not the best though. However the things which were mentioned above really enchanced the experience for me.She looks like the most powerful superhero and since events take 24 years ago I thought she died, but nope, she was just in another galaxy. This really will get interesting. And she's in Endgame, so I'm actually even more excited that I will see her there!",NA
"Captain Marvel","cjc0201","10 March 2019","I was honestly scared going to see Captain Marvel. She is one of my favorite superhero's and I was anxious to see what Marvel would do. I typically trust Marvel in all their decisions, however I cared that this movie did well. After reading reviews I am a bit confused. Did people watch the same movie as me?
I have a couple theories when it comes to the bad reviews.
1) People are trying to rate this like it is a normal movie. Captain Marvel is an origin story yes, however it transcends the cliche origin feel because of the way it is paced and edited together as a story. I admit that it is a bit weird. The movie doesn't really have a beginning middle and end because the nature of the film and I appreciated that. Captain Marvel assumes that you've seen the other MCU films and there is nothing wrong with that.
2. People are roasting Brie Larson as an actress. News flash: she's the only Avenger with an Oscar and just because you don't like the interpretation of a character doesn't make the actress bad. Her sassy charisma was super funny in my opinion and I appreciated the dry direct humor.
3. She's a woman. As a man who's enjoyed comics, movies and superheroes for a long time, I have seen people value male superhero or find particular interest in the males more than females. There is nothing wrong with this, however don't botch your rating simply because a female superhero doesn't quite fit your superhero desire. News flash: Captain Marvel is here to stay and quite frankly... will be the new leader of the MCU whether you liked her movie or not.
5. Spoiler alert! I think some people may have been mad about how the Skrulls were used. Kevin Feige released a statement that essentially read, ""skrulls can be good or bad just like humans and we'll probably see them again."" I love this explanation because it's true. Within a while species there is definitely potential for skrulls to be good or bad, however their plot in Captain Marvel was fresh and unexpected therefore I appreciated it. Plus the Skrulls added some unexpected humor!
6. I have seen a lot of people trash Carol's character development. Which once again I would relate back to the pacing and unique scenario of her not knowing parts of her own story. I felt like this fact was fine and considering it is her first movie of probably a lot, we're gonna see her really grow as a character and leader.
Overall, this was a great movie! Unique pacing that made it original to watch, fantastic character arcs and plot twists that still bring the same epitome of her original origin story!
Go watch it for yourself and form original opinions on this movie!",NA
