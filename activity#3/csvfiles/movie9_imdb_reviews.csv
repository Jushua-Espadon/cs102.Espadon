"Iam-Not-In-Danger-Iam-The-Danger","24 February 2020","This movie contains some throughly enjoyable moments that are on par with some of Downey Jnr's highlights as Tony Stark. The relationship between Pepper and Tony is taken further and built upon brilliantly in this movie. It contains some really cool and innovative action scenes which are taken for granted now. However the poor villain, a pattern in Iron Man Solo Outings, and the lack of direction meant this is easily the poorest Iron Man Performance. It's still an entertaining watch but you wouldn't be wrong if you skipped this movie when rewatching MCU Classics.","

"dbborroughs","5 June 2010","Disappointing and uneven follow up to the powerhouse of a few years ago.Jon Favreau proves that his ability to direct a solid movie isn't there. forgive me the only film of his that I think worked start to finish was the first film.The pacing is all off with whole sequences going on too long or not long enough. Honestly most of the first half is numbing with the result that I wanted to curl up and go to sleep.Realism is out the window with several sequences looking more like the sort of things we'd make fun of from 1970's movies (The race sequence prior to Iron man is just silly- though once Iron Man shows up it's note perfect. And bits of the final fight sequence screamed Conquest of the Planet of the Apes) This is a movie of pieces. the script is good, but badly directed. There a moments that are on target with the end of the race sequence excellent, The creation of Bullwhip into a real villain, Black Widow kicking ass, and other small moments that show what the film should have been. Unfortunately Favreau in putting the film together ruined it (Or was it th editor?) The performances are excellent for the most part with the exception of Paltrow who has become shrill and Sam Rockwell who has been given nothing to do so he does shtick.This will play better on DVD where you can zip past the dead spots.","

"ma-cortes","27 June 2011","A well-intentioned and interesting plot based on the characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby , following the events developed in ¨Iron Man I ¨ and repeating the main actors . Because of his superhero alter ego, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must contend with deadly issues involving the government, his own friends and new enemies . With the world now learns of his dual life as Stark is submitted to the armored pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military , being only helped by SHIELD agency formed by colonel Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) . Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) at his side , must forge new alliances and battle evil enemies as Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and Justin Hammer ( Sam Rockwell). Heroes aren't born !. They're built !. Get ready for a different breed of heavy metal hero !. Prepare for heavy metal! Even heroes fall !. Unleash the power behind the armor !. It's not the armor that makes the hero, but the man inside !Nice performance by Rober Downey Jr as superhero Iron Man, the billionaire inventor named Tony Stark who faces powerful enemies . This spectacular comic-book movie contains fantasy , noisy action, humor , romance , thrills and is pretty entertaining. This is a dynamic, fast- paced and fun movie . Full of action , it's complemented by exciting images, thrills and breathtaking scenes , including groundbreaking computer generator special effects . The picture relies on terrific flying sequences , rousing fighting , and relentless pursuits . The attractive story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Iron Man I¨ also directed by Jon Favreau ; both movies result to be an intense variation on Stan Lee's comic book creation . Our superhero, well incarnated by Downey Jr dons splendidly the metallic armor , the reason for he can be identified the rest of his life as Iron Man and he deserves credit for remaining true to character . Breathtaking array of technical effects with impressive set pieces illuminate the Iron Man's full-blown adventures . The amazing plot is pure entertainment and with screenplay by actor/writer Justin Theroux , based on characters created by Stan Lee , as usual appears in a brief cameo . Overwhelming production design , though full of digital effects with impressive scenes and portentous fights . Rousing musical score fitting to action by composer John Debney and colorful cinematography by cameraman Matthew Libatique .The motion picture was professionally directed by Jon Favreau , an ordinary secondary actor who triumphs as fimmaker with ¨Zathura¨, ¨Elf¨ , ¨Iron Man I¨and of course in this ¨Iron Man 2¨ .This big budgeted movie was compellingly made by John Favreau , directing brilliantly this superhero story . Subsequently , Favreau shot other spectacular and family movies with similar technician and artistic style : ¨Jungle Book¨ (2016) and ¨The Lion King¨ (2019) . Rating : Interesting and passable sequel .","

"xamtaro","4 May 2010","The sequel to Marvel studio's surprise hit of 2008 is here, bigger than ever. But is it better? After the surprise success of Iron Man, expectations for the sequel, from both movie viewers and long time comic books fans, were no doubt high.Picking off where the first film ended, billionaire genius Tony Stark has just revealed to the world his identity as the armor clad superhero, Iron Man. Now he reaps the whirlwind consequences of his actions as both the military and unscrupulous competitor Justin Hammer vie to obtain the secrets of Stark's Iron Man technology for their own gain. Too add to the flames, Stark soon discovers that the very technology that is keeping his heart alive is also poisoning him. As he tries to salvage a life that is slowly falling to pieces and his growing feelings for his long time assistant Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow), Starks has to contend to with a foreign weapons genius named Ivan Vanko who seems to bear a deep seated grudge against the ailing billionaire; a grudge that stemmed from the legacy of Tony's father, Howard Stark.Whatever was good in the first movie is carried on in true sequel fashion. The acting and chemistry among the cast is definitely the highlight of the whole film. Robert Downey Jr IS Tony Stark, though less of a playboy following his ""change of heart""(figuratively and literally) in the first movie, but still the same wisecracking, smirky eccentric. Everyone is just so natural in their roles including the villains, especially The character of Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell. Hammer had all the makings of a silly one dimensional villainous caricature, but manages to be a well rounded scumbag of a corporate competitor, providing some excellent comic relief while still presenting a credible threat to the hero.That being said, the script is just littered with witty banter, intelligent jokes and a good number of ""Easter eggs"" for the long time comic book fans. Writer Justin Theroux had a good number of interesting themes going for this movie, most notable of which is the theme of ""legacy"", of what people leave behind when they are gone; their impressions on their successors and how the effects of their past actions would echo down the years long after one has passed. Stark himself, faced with his inevitable demise, does not want to leave a legacy of death as a weapons designer. Aside from that, we see how the legacies of both Stark's and Ivan Vanko's fathers have affected their present lives.Now, Vanko's (played by Sin City's Mickey Rourke) is a truly tragic tale. It is easy to pass him off as a ""darth maul"" type character with no other purpose than to provide the hero with a powerful opponent for the mandatory climax. But to the more attentive viewers, one can see how Vanko is basically the dark opposite reflection of Tony Stark. Both are geniuses, both are where they are because of their respective fathers yet different circumstances in life brought them down entirely different paths. The parallels between his origin story of creating the ""whiplash"" powered armor from scrap, getting captured(in a similarly explosive manner) in order to develop weapons for one man to bring down his competitor all the way to his cunning escape plan and his mistaken impression about his dearly departed father are all uncannily similar to Tony Stark's experiences in the first movie that led up to his debut as the hero Iron Man and his mistaken impression about his own father.The one thing viewers might not appreciate is that this sequel seems to lack that sense of ""fun"" that the first film had, taking on a more serious tone at times to dish out the more complex themes and even a romantic sub-plot. It really is too bad that the more complex themes are there but not really expanded upon. This leaves a lot of ""could have been more"" moments hanging by the time the show ends. At least the action is satisfying high octane eye candy as Jon Favreau's steady directing hand brings out the intensity of every battle scene. Special effects are top notch as usual except for a couple of cartoony looking moments that do require some suspension of disbelief, for example the briefcase that transforms into an iron man armor with armor parts seemingly appearing from out of nowhere.By the time the all too familiar final battle is over and the credits start rolling, one gets the impression that Iron Man 2 could have been a lot more than the sum of its parts. A little longer running time would have fixed most of the story kinks but perhaps Marvel is merely using this movie as a money generator and spring board to something greater.(Blatant teasers are thrown into the narrative itself almost like a running catalog of future Marvel film projects).Topping the first film is no easy feat and of course Iron Man 2 would disappoint a few here and there. But it is nonetheless one of the most entertaining comic book movies that mixes action, wit, drama and cast chemistry so well. If widespread appeal is its purpose, then Iron Man 2 has fulfilled that function magnificently in that even a newcomer to the franchise can kick back and enjoy the show. Marvel studios has started a new legacy beyond great comics. Here is a legacy of comic book movies, true to the spirit of its source material yet tailored nicely to the tastes of the modern movie audience.","

"DICK STEEL","29 April 2010","Downey Jr continues his smirky role as the playboy and laissez-faire persona of Tony Stark (no Downey Jr, no Tony Stark I'd say!), now facing a life-threatening intoxication situation, and constantly having to deflect the US military's interest in and compelling him to turn over the Iron Man suit. Then of course there's the romantic angle with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts who gets expanded screen time here, to whom he hands over Stark Industries to by appointing her CEO. I had enjoyed all the scenes between Paltrow and Downey Jr as they shared great chemistry, and didn't mind that the film took the pause from the action to throw the spotlight on this. In fact, Stark is pretty much the Santa Claus in giving away things, having to face his mortality and to put some business continuity plans into motion. A little too bad that the scene in the teaser trailer highlighting the banter in the plane didn't make it to the final cut.But all work and no play makes him a grumpy soul, so enter Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman, his new sexy private secretary from the legal department who is more than meets the eye. Johansson has now proved that she's got it in her to be in an action film, and her limited action scenes here will surprise and leave you breathless. Mickey Rourke seem to have picked off from his Wrestler role in playing the Russian villain Ivan Vanko, riding on the parallel and theme of Fathers and Sons, whose father was seemingly played out by Howard Stark, and is finding it apt to finally take it out on Stark Industries using similar technology the earlier generation developed, and now backed by sugar daddy industrialist Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell. Rockwell plays the classic business rival bitterly humiliated by Tony, and from observing Ivan's potential, decided to bankroll the Russian's capability for the US military. Hating a man in common make for strange bedfellows indeed.Cameo wise, there's Stan Lee if you can spot him in a brief moment, probably his easiest and non event-filled one to date given he's just standing around, Samuel L. Jackson continuing his role as Nick Fury of SHIELD, now assessing Tony Stark to determine if he's indeed the man they need for his top secret boy band, Gary Shandling as the senator pursuing the weaponization of the Iron Man suit for the military, and of course, director Jon Favreau himself who continues his role as Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan, and you can tell his acting itch from his expanded role in getting in on the fun rather than just solely standing behind the camera.But of course the tongues will wag whether Don Cheadle can pick up from where Terrence Howard left off. Whatever the reason may be for the latter's departure, he will likely be kicking his behind now for leaving the project. That anticipatory look Rhodes had in the first film at the metal suit worn would bring a smile to any fanboy in the know of what would be the next logical step, and frankly speaking I would have enjoyed some continuity here. But having a different actor in a role done by someone else in a preceding film isn't something new, and Cheadle stepped in confidently from the start, helped by the script which puts it in point blank terms that he's there now, and they should move on. Well said, and great job on being War Machine, in a best-friends-temporal fallout subplot which accounted for the action at the midway mark.Justin Theroux, who wrote the screenplay for Tropic Thunder, took over the scriptwriting for this film, doing the narrative justice with plenty of fan-moments, and oh-not-so subtle merchandising opportunities that Tony Stark would be proud of. The excellent casting has the brilliance of Theroux's story to thank for in keeping the many subplots in check, making Marvel fans happy through the plenty of easter eggs peppered around, coming up with an intoxication of a different sort for Tony Stark to deal with and a chance for him to go back to the drawing board, getting his hands dirty with the building of something. Action-wise, yes there is only a handful of them, but each of them brought something to the table in terms of excitement, thrills and spills. The special effects and graphics here were one up against the previous film, and it was a definite visual feast especially when suits got up against suits, warranting a second look at the film just to catch everything that's happening at the same time. The finale was a full 30 minutes worth of action end to end and features the Iron Man-War Machine tag team up, which served up a lot more than what we've all glimpsed from clips here and there. Singapore, this is yet another opportunity to be proud of with our compatriots also involved in the visual effects department, ala Kick-Ass.Iron Man 2 is set to convert the non-fan, and is crafted so that newcomers to the hero could jump right into the fun without needing to watch the first one (why haven't you!). For Marvel fans though, you have Jon Favreau to thank for whetting all our appetites in making this film the teaser to the other upcoming Marvel films such as Captain America, Thor, and I will be right there to holler Avengers Assemble! when the time comes. Stay until the end of the credits for a scene which will make you salivate. A-One!","

"Seth_Rogue_One","20 November 2016","Yet another ridiculously high rated Marvel movie, we get it Marvel fanboys you just love it when a new Marvel movie comes out, so much that you forget any flaws in it and give it a 10 or a 9 anyways.But come on seriously? Wouldn't you rather they spent a little time at actually writing a somewhat decent script and making it a bit more entertaining than to praise EVERYTHING they do to the skies just because you want a new chapter in the Marvel universe?Cause this is NOT a good movie, 35 minutes of decent at best action and 85 minutes of nonsensical blabber.Mickey Rourke was the only highlight in this movie, the scene at the racetrack with him was really cool but then he just became a wasted opportunity just like the rest of the movie.A really boring turd of a film.","

"khanbaliq2","11 June 2010","Iron Man 2 is a fine sequel. Almost the whole cast returns intact, and director Jon Favreau has more screen time in his role as Happy Hogan. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is riding high after the events of Iron Man (2008). He has become famous worldwide, and he re-institutes the Stark Expo. But problems begin to pile up. Another wealthy industrialist wants his Iron Man technology. Then a new villain appears. Stark's relationship with his assistant Virginia Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also expanded upon. There's a lot going on in the film, but its rather weak script hurts it for sure. Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan Vanko stands out. He's more menacing than Obadiah Stane was in the first film. Vanko's first encounter with Stark leads to a thrilling fight scene. Unfortunately Rourke's character isn't fully developed. This is a problem with other characters in the film as well. Vanko is a memorable villain but if Rourke was given more screen time and his character had more of a backstory I'm sure he could have been even more memorable. Still, Rourke tried to make his character as complex as he could.The film's special effects are excellent. Some of the time, however, they're used on shootouts and explosions that don't produce much excitement. There's a lot more humour this time around. I was smiling or laughing during most of the film. Scarlett Johansson as the beautiful Natasha Romanoff gets to show off some impressive martial arts moves. It's rather funny afterwards because no one else can fight like her. Overall, the film is not as good as Iron Man. Still, it's an entertaining summer blockbuster and the performances are solid. I wasn't expecting much from the film but was pleasantly surprised. I recommend Iron Man 2.","

"blanbrn","9 May 2010","""Iron Man"" is not my favorite superhero(that place goes to Batman)nor does he rank ahead of Wonder Women still Tony Stark is an interesting cocky sucker of enough character to watch. As ""Iron Man 2"" for a sequel really delivered. As director Jon Favreau once again kept the action rolling with special effects and kick ass action sequences. Once again Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark former weapons mogul turned special agent Iron Man. This time his challenge is a Russian villain named Ivan(Mickey Rourke fresh off his classic performance in ""The Wrestler"") who wants to destroy the world with his new chemical and high tech weapons. And Sam Rockwell struts as a money hungry arms dealer.Returning is Gwyneth Paltrow as Tony's girlfriend now company CEO. And to spice up the picture a real treat of eye candy is Scarlett Johansson as Natasha who's sexy as hell! She becomes a new superhero! Really this film is a showcase for cutting edge technology that shows human inventions. And it was nice to see a cameo by Bill O' Reilly too. Overall this picture is a good treat of action and explosive technology. Probably a watch for any comic book fan.","

"masonsaul","21 November 2019","It isn't as good as the original but Iron Man 2 is still a really good sequel. Robert Downey Jr. once again gives an incredible performance and is extremely charismatic. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Sam Rockwell all give great performances. Jon Favreau's direction is really good and it's consistently funny. The CG is impressive and the music by John Denney is good. However, Mickey Rourke is wasted as a forgettable villain and the final battle is a little short.","

"ccthemovieman-1","9 October 2010","I was pleasantly surprised with this, thinking that it's probably another sequel that doesn't match up to the original. I was wrong; I thought this was better, a more likable and entertaining film than the first! Of course, it helps to know in advance that the ""hero"" (""Ton Stark,"" played by Robert Downey) is even more obnoxious in this film. Knowing that, I didn't let that bother me and just enjoyed the good acting in here and the excellent special-effects. Mickey Rourke (""Ivan Vanko"") is almost always interesting to watch so I enjoyed his role, too, even if I had a hard time understanding his Russian accent.The story is, yes, sophomoric but most action films today are. Just enjoy the funny lines, CGI, the pretty women (Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johannson) and wild heroes and villains and you should get your money's worth out of the viewing. See it on Blu-Ray and you'll enjoy it that much more.","

"Dash1969","28 April 2010","Iron Man 2 sure delivers the fun but it's such intelligent fun. Honestly, its Stan Lee meets Shakespeare. The Hammer/Stark rivalry is more like Hamlet and Claudius then Superman to Lex Luthor. Iron Man is simply more complex as a character then anything else you'll see in a summer film but it loses none of the spark or none of the pure popcorn fun. How many other films can you say that about? Stark's vulnerability is very much on display here as his personal life crumbles through various unique conflicts. He has to struggle with the government for control of his armor and deal with his growing celebrity. At the same time his personal life takes a turn as a love triangle emerges. He (like soon all of America) becomes attracted to his new aide (the lovely Scarlett Johansson), causing tension with his former assistant but now new Stark Industries CEO Pepper Potts (the also lovely Gwyneth Paltrow). They manage to pull all this off remarkably well and still leave character time for Rhodey and the villains. It's a believable sci-fi story featuring an intellect story that's wild but has the right amount of humor, angst and drama. Like I remember about Iron Man 1, I can't think of a weak moment in the film. The visual effects are incredible. They did the memory of their boss, the great Stan Winston, proud. They set the bar high again. Now the only question is whether they have anything left in the tank for Iron Man 3? I'm betting that they do.","

"BwSwim","10 May 2010","For some reason this movie had not been getting the greatest critic reviews. I do not understand that at all. I thought the movie was very enjoyable and a successful sequel in the series.For anyone who has seen the first Iron Man you can expect much of the same in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark like he is meant for the part. He has the same sarcastic wit and self-confidence that is evident in his other movie roles. Gwyeneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts, has a comes more to the forefront in the sequel. I also personally love that Jon Favreau is the driver for Stark/Potts, and that he gets into the action a little bit. You have to respect the director for that, even though Jon has done plenty of acting himself.Normally in when they replace someone in a sequel with a different actor/actress I am very upset. However, Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2 as War Machine/Lt. Rhodes made me happy. This is similar to what happened with Maggie Gylenhal in the Dark Night.Samuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury has a bigger role, and it leads all the viewers into wanting The Avengers movie to come out immediately. Scarlett Johansson also showed up with some impressive stunt work, along with her always gorgeous looks.All in all it was a well done sequel. The plot is not too convoluted to follow. The new villain, played by Mickey Rourke, is very impressive and fun to watch. The action scenes are all entertaining but they do not completely drive the movie. The only thing that I wished for leaving the theater was a longer final fight scene.Also, make sure to watch after the credits!! It is short, but worth it.","

"EddyOne","28 April 2010","Saw the movie in a press screening here are my humble thoughts:Before I start with my short review of Iron Man 2, I have to say two words about Iron Man 1. I really dug the first one despite of being a little disappointed by the grand finale. Robert Downey Jr. kills it, action, humor, pacing... loved it. I'm not a big comic geek, and not that familiar with the original Iron Man comics, so please excuse if some of the stuff I thought was weird, was actually accurate adapted.So while the opening credits where rolling and I saw all the big names of actors that I happen to love, I really thought that it might be hard to give all of them a fair amount of stuff to do in the movie. And as it happened to turn out, I was right. I was especially disappointed by Mickey Rourke's part as Whiplash. Don't get me wrong, Rourke was great. He looks mean as usual and I loved every scene he's in. Unfortunately Favreau really pulled a Darth Maul on him. After the last fight I honestly sat in my chair and was like ""that's it? you can't be serious?!"". Rourke's Character had almost the same potential (at least from his talent as an actor and his looks in the movie) as Heath Ledger's Joker in Dark Knight. But he never lived up to that expectation due to the lack of screen time and, well... a purpose.But the main problem I had with Iron Man 2 was the lack of a meaningful story and motivation for almost all of the characters. We are introduced to Scarlett Johansson's ""Black Widow"", and blame it on my lack of knowledge of the graphic novels, but I had no Idea what her purpose in the movie was. The first part of the movie she's just the hot secretary with almost no lines. Eventually she puts on a tight super hero costume and tries to find Whiplash. There is a brief action-sequence, where she kicks some ass, but truth be told, Hit-Girl would wipe the floor with Black Widow. What I really liked though, was Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. He totally killed it and you can tell he enjoyed his part as the sleazy scumbag pulling the strings in the background.I also liked Don Cheadle as James Rhodes (he was on par with Terrence Howard on this one), but I felt his character suffered from the lack of time for character development. There is this scene, where Tony Stark is seriously messed up, partying at his home in his Iron Man suit and randomly shooting stuff. Rhodes is tired of the situation and grabs himself another one of the Iron Man suits, battles Stark and than leaves. With the suit. I don't know if that's the way it was done in the comics, but I didn't like it at all. In the first movie we witness how Stark becomes Iron Man, how he needs to learn to use the suit and become one with it, how he builds it and we can understand, that he is the only one, who could use it that way. Apparently we're wrong, because all you need, is the suit. It's like anyone could be Batman, if he just could get a hold of his cape. There is no explanation as to why Rhodes can fly this suit like he owns it, there isn't anything told about the relationship between Stark and Rhodes. I just felt this part was incredible weak.The whole movie felt like a setup for another movie. Characters are introduced, stuff happens, but nothing really matters, at best it hints, that there COULD be happening something in the future.Another big problem I had though, was the lack of 'magic moments' and thrilling action, like in the first flick (I still get goosebumps, thinking about how Tony Stark flew in his suit for the first time). Everything just runs too smooth, there is almost no tension, you never think anything could harm Tony Stark, you never feel something bad is about to happen. If I compare this with the incredible Dark Knight, it feels like a kids movie, something like the ranks of Sky High. Plus, there was just to little Iron Man in Iron Man, to little I care about. Iron Man 2 was made to prepare us for The Avengers and Thor, but by being that, it kinda forgot to be something in it's own. That's the biggest difference to the first flick, who was original, fresh and smart.Sounds pretty much like a bash, but all that being said, I was fairly entertained. The performances of the main characters each were pretty good. The cast was perfect. Of course all the special effects are amazing, with a lot attention to detail. I loved all the 'augmented reality"" stuff going on in Starks garage. The movie is funny (actually it felt more like a comedy than an action flick) and when the action happens, it's looking great. The biggest let down is the potential this movie and most and for all the characters had, which wasn't used. However this is only the review of someone who's fairly unfamiliar with the graphic novel.","

"sauravjoshi85","7 January 2020","Iron Man 2 is the second part Iron Man movie based on the Marvel Comics characters with the name Iron Man. The movie is directed by Jon Favreau and stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke and Samuel L.

The movie might not be able to keep the proficiency of the prequel but still the movie has its dose of adventure.Acting of Robert Downey Jr. has been fantastic with his small one liners will also provide some comic relief. The script may have it's drawbacks but credit should be given to the director to keep it engaging.The movie has also tries to show the emotional Father Son relationship by showcasing senior Stark as a hero and a loving Father.Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson were great, Samuel L. Jackson was surprisingly good and so as Sam Rockwell in a Jealous competitor.The only drawback of the movie is a weak villain although it tried to showcase the villain in a near perfect but the way he dies could've been made more challenging but Mickey Rourke played it's part beautifully.Overall an entertaining high octane movie.","

"Velociraptor256","29 April 2010","At its high points - the first act and the climax - Iron Man 2 is actually better than the first film. Everything up to and including the action scene in Monaco is just great fun to watch: the action, the character interactions, and of course Robert Downey Jr's wonderful portrayal of Tony Stark. And the action scene at the end is pretty epic.The problem is, the film just stops being so much fun in-between. In a large proportion of this time, it's either going too slowly with little happening that's exciting or even particularly interesting, or it's providing some silly moments like Iron Man lounging on a giant display donut. To be fair, there's no problem with the many subplots this movie has: they all blend together quite smoothly.The acting in this film deserves credit: almost everybody does a great job. Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow are just as entertaining as they were in the first film, Jon Favreau gets more to do as Stark's chauffeur, Don Cheadle is actually a little better than Terrence Howard as Rhodie (again, maybe because he has a bigger role), Mickey Rourke portrays a decent but overall ordinary villain, and once Scarlett Johansson is allowed to do something substantial with her own action sequence, she's well worth watching. The only weak link is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, who gets quite annoying after a while.Overall, Iron Man 2's slow middle section prevents it from being better than the first film as a whole, which is a shame considering how brilliant the beginning and end segments are.","

"Angelus2","4 May 2010","As a comic book fan, it is hard for me to admit if a certain movie has not met the huge expectations that a comic book fan may hold...Batman Begins, Dark Knight held there own, the X-Men movies not so much, Fantastic Four movies were satisfactory....Daredevil was a travesty...Iron-Man was brilliant.....This sequel, is a 50/50 for me... The beginning was brilliant, the middle was slow and random...and the end was satisfactory.The world now knows Tony Stark is Iron-Man and he lives the high life and battles injustice, but the rest of the world wants Tony's suit. Especially the American government.Robert Downey Jr is funny, charming and a little eccentric, which works with the Stark character. Gwyneth Paltrow is beautiful then ever before, she plays the caring, at times bossy secretary who is the only reason as to why Stark is still running a multi-billion dollar business. Justin Hammer played by Sam Rockwell is funny, annoying; which does wonders for our ever growing love for Stark...Mickey Rourke is satisfactory as the villain who wants to destroy Tony Stark, we don't really feel scared. And it seems that Rourke is a combination of 'Whiplash' and 'Crimson Dynamo'...But for me...Don Cheadle seemed to be out of place, I preferred Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Don Cheadle did not deliver lines very well, he did not have that 'No Nonsense' attitude that Rhodey has....Or it did not come across very well. Lastly, Samuel L.Jackson actually played Nick Fury pretty well, while I would have preferred to see Olga Kruylenko as Natalie Romanov, Scarlett Johanson was fine.The middle for me seemed to be a bit slow with random seems, yes we needed to witness the trials Tony faced but it was not dark enough for me. I would have liked to see Tony battle alcoholism, and then hand over his mantle to Rhodes, who would eventually become 'War-Machine' towards the end of the film.....Make it a little closer to the comics.But, the one thing that sold it to me, actually two things...The suit and the epic battle between Iron-Man, War Machine and the Drones.The special effects were simply dazzling and definitely a must see for all comic book fans.","

"Gordon-11","30 April 2010","This film is about Tony Stark's fight against the US government and a man who wants revenge for what the Stark family did to his father forty years ago.I found ""Iron Man 2"" very entertaining! It alternates between adrenaline and mischievous scenes. Scarlett Johansson is a great addition to the story, I was impressed by the way she pulled her character off. Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke also gave amazing performances.I was particularly impressed by the fights at the end. The fighting sequences are cool, and all the action happens against a visually spectacular expo. I think ""Iron Man 2"" is worth watching just for the ending alone. I think ""Iron Man 2"" is great entertainment, and it's even better than ""Iron Man"".","

"MovieMystro","27 April 2010","The makers of this film held nothing back. When it works, as it does here, it rekindles even a cynic's movie love. So kudos to Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, Scar-Jo, Rockwell, Rourke and especially Favreau. What a film! It is a sight to behold. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on armor action or the charismatic ""down time"" delivered by the best cast possible. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about? It's good to see the response to the movie has been, for the most part, positive. I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. (X-Men and Wolverine fans I'm looking right at you!) Iron Man 2 stayed close enough to its roots and I hope most judge it as a film first. If you do, I'm almost certain that everyone will enjoy it as much as I did. It easily fulfilled and then exceeded all of my expectations. The only thing I worry about is that they may be setting expectations for that Avengers movie too high. How can it possibly live up to the standard these movies are setting and setting up????? Iron Man 2 is EVERYTHING you would want in a movie and much more! It is a special treat when a sequel reaches up and delivers an excellent film that you thoroughly enjoy as much if not more than a beloved first installment. It truly feels like they just paused and kept telling the same story but with more of an edge. Hopefully, they can do it again and skip that third movie curse. Think of it as another installment and they'll be fine. Fitting Avengers in to the mix is even more fun to think about but I heard that Favreau will be involved with that as an executive producer. So, I'm not worried. In the meanwhile, we can all enjoy this film because it stands on its own but as a great part of a running saga.","

"Romarth","28 April 2010","Reading Iron Man 2's plot summary, things sound bleak for our characters. But not at all. This is a breezy, light-hearted, inoffensive affair that saunters at a magnetic pace, with emotional discomfiting a far thought. Which is pretty refreshing, to say the least. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the complete of antithesis of recent comic book movies. For one, it certainly isn't darker than its predecessor, absent its slow-burning first half and latched-on social commentary. It also gives itself the poetic license to stretch credulity. This is a movie about a man who flies around in metal suit, blasting away multicolored-haired Russians with electric whips. Realism simply doesn't apply, and thankfully director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux take affectionate liberty with the bonds of belief. Yes, Ivan Vanko can secretly build super technology unbeknownst to his suppliers. And yes, the only way to incapacitate a drunken Tony is to beat the crap out of him in a Iron Man suit. No complaints here! Iron Man 2 is also very much Iron Man's superior, although partly by default. The first movie was stuck with a pedantic origin story. However, the sequel had no shortage of possible paths to take. Which did it choose? The way you should always go; the road of characterization. Rather than tediously expand upon its universe, Iron Man 2 simply reprises its dramatis personae and sticks them into situations graver than before, upping the ante but reiterating the overall heart and spirit of its predecessor. The characters are well-etched, each snappy exchange rendered with a mature pathos that contrasts with the spurious scenarios that they feature in between of. Iron Man 2 could easily be called a comedy, but the naturalism of the comedy is seamless; you get the sense that it would be impossible to write this movie without having these vibrant characters joke and jeer.To bring the clever screenplay to life is the phenomenal cast. Robert Downey, Jr., as always, is effortlessly captivating. Charisma defined and an scandalously unsung master of versatility (he's not just playing himself, people!), it's no breaking news that he's still one of the most watchable actors ever. He is the perfect Tony Stark, and a more-than-worthy representative of the thinking man's action star. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow as the pragmatic Pepper Pots is electric, and she too turns in a fine performance. Wistful, but by no means a damsel in distress, she is probably the realest character.The baddies, just as essential as the hero, don't disappoint either. Another wrong from last time round successfully remedied is the lack of genuinely menacing villains. Jeff Bridges honored us with his always-welcome presence in Iron Man, but his warm affability was anything but menacing. This time, however, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell (oddly, both novices to blockbuster attention) are on duty, offering more than enough bang for your villainy buck. Rourke as Anton Vanko/""Whiplash"", supplements a composite of the unintentionally hokey showman, supercilious mastermind, and the seemingly unstoppable behemoth. This effectively fends off one-noteness, and Rourke perfectly embodies the duality of Vanko's deceptively boorish visage and surprisingly vast intellect, while still indulging in the welcome irreverence that comes with the comic book villain (his Russian drawl is humorous but gives him an otherworldly conviction).Rockwell, on the other hand, is flat-out comic relief as Stark's weaselly rival – though not necessarily a threatening one – Justin Hammer. He is excellent in the part; an absolute delight to watch, whether irascibly mugging in a loss for words with his insubordinate partner Vanko or, in one of the movie's best moments, shamelessly accolading his own (faulty) inventions with juvenile zeal.Unfortunately, with all these characters butting heads for screen time, co-stars Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansson as Tony's pal Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes and eventual partner War Machine and alluring temptress of a new assistant Natalie Rushman, respectively, are given the short straw. Both are more than able of carrying a scene, but while the script lavishes Tony with many moments in which to brood his way into some fine character development, and to convey Pepper's many grievances, neither supporting character is as lucky. Cheadle's moments of potential are all obstructed by the War Machine suit, and everything otherwise requires him to lucidly voice reason as a foil to the devil may care Tony. Johansson is a non-event, her Natalie Rushman an amoral nothing role, and her Black Widow guise is not so much daring femme fatale as listless sex symbol. She acts as merely a vessel for fan service, be it in her skintight suit for the general audience or that she represents another stepping stone to an Avengers movie for esoteric comic book fans.The movie is inter cut between the scenes of terse characterization and octane action. The latter is a dizzying combination of rapid vicissitudes and toe-to-toe skirmishes, high on CGI, low on genuine peril. In fact, Iron Man 2 could quite possibly have been a masterpiece of the genre had it lived up to its first forty minutes of exuberance and intrigue. But once the clumsy pugilism of Iron Man and Whiplash takes place, the movie falls flat. The power play is nonexistent, because it's hard to believe anyone could stand a chance against ol' Shellhead. And if no sense of alarm can be conveyed when Iron Man is caught in an unusually melee showdown, the flight sequences leave no impression. Yes, the special effects are astounding, but it's all for nothing if there's no dramatic undercurrent.Otherwise, please, don't mistake my raving for fanboy hyperbole; Iron Man 2 is great. It's well-written, well-acted, and simultaneously a loving throwback to comic book norm and a break from recent tradition. It's a rare occurrence to be thankful for, because God knows if this follows the superhero trilogy formula, the third one will suck. Which would tragically make this movie's thrilling departure from cliché null and void.","

"DKosty123","9 May 2010","In my view, this movie is better than the first installment. There are several reasons for me so naturally I want to list them. I was surprised that all the outrageous trailers for the film turned out to be in the film. Yet they made too much sense & didn't seem quite as outrageous.Robert Downey Jr. is excellent again. He is perfectly in character as Tony Stark. There is an explanation for the outrageous behavior which makes total sense. Clue- if you had all the power on Earth & thought you were going to die, what would you do?There are some nice location shots in this, particularly Monte Carlo.All the supporting cast is back from Iron Man with some excellent additions. Lucas Film effects & Skaywalker sound are much in evidence. To me this film has a more traditional film Hollywood pace. It has perfect spacing between the action sequences & the story sequences. No sequence is too long to get boring. The last half of the first film had a battle sequence that was much too long. People fall in love with computer effects too often.There is a new arch nemesis for Iron Man. See the film & stay all the way until after the credits. There is an additional scene.","

"tedg","18 May 2010","Common sense hits the front office at Marvel's adventure in movie-making. Until now, they've just made bad films. Bad.The basic problem, I believe, is that the rest of the world is out exploiting the third dimension and Marvel insists on making flat movies. Even Spidermen, where the character lives and fights in space was flat. All of a sudden, Marvel and ILM wise up. This not only matches but excels what we have at this time in terms of complex three dimensional motion. The camera flies. Objects fly and the two weave in ways new to us. The camera is usually placed in some relatively stationary place to allow you to see what is going on. That place is removed from the action. Sometimes the camera becomes or emulates a POV of a flying or moving object as if it is in the action — or perhaps a character. The game in this new future is a matter of combining the two so that it has the properties of both, but is neither. Done well, it generates pure cinematic excitement. Done well, it overwhelms everything else and thrills because it is so otherworldly. It is done well here. Done well. And it doesn't have to be used to cloud deficiencies elsewhere. All is at least competent and some things: Downey, Rockwell and the production design are excellent.This dimensional thing is done so well that it is mirrored elsewhere. Stark's computers have a hand and voice manipulatable three dimensional, haptic, multiaffordance holographic interface. The motion is less important here than the notion of projected dimensionality. His nemesis? Well, he manages an entire army of drones by a single QWERTY keyboard and a DOS-like display. The contrast is, I think a deliberate thing. They would have pimped up Stark's machine anyway, but having the contrast is a subtle narrative reminder of the difference in dimensionality of the thing.Oh, it is also mirrored in the two women. One is a lighthaired, ponytailed redhead who never leaves the plane. The other is a fiery darker redhead with wild hair (in her real persona) who in a remarkable fight scene is profoundly three-dimensional. Samuel Jackson has decided to do anything, work anywhere, take any pay cut to be the face of the master organization that watches us. I think he knows that this legacy will live for generations, planted in juvenile minds eager for explanatory conspiracies. These theories for some reason rarely are discarded as kids age. It is his face now that is often associated with the leader of the new demigods the genre is creating. Smart building of intellectual property for someone with limited range.Downey. What a guy. Let's hope he takes some of his power to create projects that matter in some way beyond merely thrilling by advancing the craft of seeing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"DUKEJBM","27 April 2010","Everyone will rave about the action but Iron Man 2 delivers a beguiling character study behind and above the special effects. You do not leave your I.Q. at the door with this summer movie as you too often need to do. The award winning cast doesn't back down and delivers up to their talent. They're rising to the material, and even elevating it to levels rarely seen in a comic adaptation film. Robert Downey Jr delivers another remarkable performance. Giving one of our generation's greatest actors such a cool character to bring to life happens once in a lifetime. Watching him draw on ALL emotions is as good as it gets. Not to give any spoilers but there's a dark side to Tony Stark because of his impending death and that aspect of the film makes Downey shine. Add the flair and superhero text and we may be talking Oscar. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also bring their top stuff.Aided by those great performances, the writing delivers genuine wit and is strong across the board. I think a lot of summer films are lost in pre-production when they decide to shoot a dumb script or make it up as they go along. Clearly, Iron Man 2 must have had a strong script and great writers. They avoid a lot of the mistakes other films like this make. The story is as good as any comic book adaptation I've ever seen. The plot actually tugs at the heart strings, makes you think and still hits the funny bone more then once. The story and epic battles make perfect sense. What I liked about the first Iron Man is that it was somewhat grounded in reality. No teenage boys or small girls as superheroes or men dressing up as rodents, not that there's inherently anything wrong with those turns. I simply like fantasy grounded in reality. The effects really did surpass what they did before and I actually thought the last time out they deserved FX Oscar consideration. These are some of the best scenes out of any action film ever. Best of all, I couldn't tell what was Computer Generated Images and what was practical.Yes, that's twice I mentioned Oscar so I might as well do it a third time. A nomination for best picture wouldn't surprise me at all at this point. I really loved this movie.","

"Hellmant","14 September 2010","'IRON MAN 2': Five Stars (Out of Five) Like many second films in popular fantasy / action franchises (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'SPIDER-MAN 2', 'ALIENS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'X-MEN 2', etc.)'IRON MAN 2' takes what worked about the first film and totally ups the ante and creatively expands on the characters and drama of the first film to probably it's emotional and entertaining peak! It in many ways blows the first film out of the water. Although the action is a lot less frequent than you might expect, from a big superhero blockbuster extravaganza like this, when it does happen it's breathtaking; the race-car fight scene, which happens about a third of the way into the movie, is so cool it's mind-blowing and it's also emotionally intense (It's one of the raddest scenes I've ever seen in a movie and the rest of the movie never quite tops it; so the climax does happen pretty early on but that's OK, there's still plenty of quality movie left even so).What's best about the movie is not the action though it's the character drama and dialog; it would be a crime if this thing doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for best screenplay, although I'm sure that's a crime that will most likely be committed (Robert Downey Jr. also unarguably deserves a nomination for his acting performance as well though). The movie is jam packed with some of the most witty clever dialog and interesting character development I've ever seen in a blockbuster like this! The whole thing is a very complicated psychological character exploration, all revolving around the most fascinating superhero character to ever hit the big screen; the eccentric somewhat mad genius that is Tony Stark (once again insanely but amazingly portrayed by Downey Jr.).The film centers around Stark's battles (not with bad guys and world threats, but) with health issues (he's being poisoned to death by the machine he created, in his chest, that initially saved him), alcoholism, a Government that wants to take control of his technology for what they say is the good of the country and his overall fight to keep his sanity dealing with all this stress. Throw in Sam Rockwell as an impressively portrayed billionaire tech rival and Mickey Rourke as a soft spoken madman bent on revenge against the Stark family, who he blames for stealing his father's ideas, and you've got a complete circus act of oddly interesting characters. There's also Don Cheadle cleverly taking over the role of Stark's best friend James Rhodes (although Terrence Howard in the first film was better), there's a little Samuel L. Jackson being cool like always and there's some more Jon Favreau (more than the first film) that adds some nice comedic touches. There is a very sexy Scarlett Johansson playing another super hero named 'Black Widow' but the female characters are a little underdeveloped compared to the men.You can tell it was written by a man (actor Justin Theroux who's only other writing credit is co-writing 'TROPIC THUNDER', another Downey Jr. scene stealer); the women dialog is mostly important plot advancement stuff but with the guys 80 percent of it could have been tossed and the plot would have been intact but it's just so natural and entertaining; like real people shooting the breeze! That's the brilliance of the film! Favreau has also come pretty far as a director; he's much more polished now and knows what's most important to the film. The whole movie just has an energy to it that can't quite be described in words. It's an astonishing film going experience if you really like film!Watch our review show, 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxp3NkMebd8","

"IronBallsM","26 April 2010","Yes, I'm one of the fortunate few who got to see this gem a bit early and I'm happy to report that they took what worked so well in Iron Man and ran with it in an extremely gratifying way. The complexity, depth, heart and action are even more off the charts than the first film. It's is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie period. They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one and built upon it masterfully. Now we get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer weaved with a celebrity who should have never let the cat out of the bag in the final moments of Iron Man 1. They promised to up the action from the first film and they certainly did but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. It has the same flavor and humor of the original and it may even focus more on the fabulous relationships already developed. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film. I didn't think that was possible. Everyone came to play and this great cast brought their best stuff and it shows on screen. Everyone knew Downey, Paltrow and Cheadle could act but Bill O'Reilly and The CNN anchor? Yes, they show up and do a GREAT job in extended cameos. Rourke and Rockwell are PERFECT as the duel foils for Tony Stark, I mean PERFECT. From the Grand Prix in Monaco to the amazing finale, buckle up because this is one intense, interesting, intelligent and fun ride. My only real complaint is that Scarlett's Black Widow has too little screen time. Still, a film that leaves you clamoring for more isn't the worst sin in the world.When I was done viewing this movie, all I could think about was how it instantly stacks up to the all-time great sequels. What was said about classics like Spider-Man 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back, TDK and even Godfather 2 holds true for Iron Man 2. I honestly can't wait to see it again.","

"g-bodyl","30 September 2010","I went in the theaters with an open mind ready to expect the best and that is what I got. Iron Man 2 is just as good maybe even better than the first one. Robert Downey Jr is superb as Tony Stark once again. I also loved the performance by Mickey Rourke as Whiplash. I didn't expect much out of him. And of course we all know why Scarlett Johansson is here.This movie takes place right after Stark becomes public. He has to deal with the government who wants to take his suit and Whiplash who wants to kill him because of his father, Howard.I loved everything here. I enjoyed the action, the chicks, the cars, the special effects, and much more. The only thing I really hated was that Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard. I love Cheadle's acting but Howard was perfect in the first one.Overall, this is a fantastic sequel. I hope they make Iron man 3 and I can't wait until the Avengers in two years. I rate this film 10/10.","

"evan_harvey","3 May 2010","Just saw Iron Man 2, and while I thought the first one was a bit overrated, I had hopes. They quickly dissipated.Firstly, there was no theme. The first Iron Man had a theme - it was about Tony Stark changing his life and becoming a better man. Iron Man 2 had no theme at all.Secondly, the plot was messy: there just happens to be another brilliant scientist who can build an advanced power source in a squalid Moscow shack? Okay, we had to swallow that Tony Stark could build one in the middle of freakin' Afghanistan, but twice? That's too much.Weren't Pepper and Tony supposed to get together at the end of the first film? In this one they stay at arm's length, and I wondered if there was any romance there at all. That scene from the preview where Pepper kisses his helmet and Tony jumps from the back of the plane after it? Gone.The Avengers? Samuel L Jackson with an eye patch? Who the hell wears an eye patch today and doesn't get laughed at? Why introduce paper-thin characters that really do nothing? And it's not like anything actually happened with them anyway, so why waste out time and goodwill?Thirdly, the film didn't really go anywhere in terms of advancing the Iron Man story. There were a few interesting concepts - what does Iron Man do now that everyone knows who he is? Will the US military get their hands on it? - but these, while addressed, where never really given much thought. Instead, Tony's best friend (Cheadle) steals the other suit. What? Even after being given an order to do so, why would his friend do that?Fourth, the acting: Gwenyth Paltrow is a terrible actress. So it Scarlett Johansson, but at least she's smoking hot. Don Cheadle is no Terrance Howard. While Howard himself isn't a great actor, he owned the role in Iron Man 1. Cheadle just didn't have the personality and charisma, and you'll note he gets very little screen time too.It wasn't a completely horrible film, but it wasn't worth the 7.9 IMDb gives it. Much closer to a flat 5.0. The direction is a bit messy - the action scenes aren't as clean as they should be. Some great SXF, as you'd expect. Save your money for the DVD.","

"planktonrules","7 July 2010","About three days before I went to see ""Iron Man 2"", I watched the original ""Iron Man"" for the second time. This time, my 20 year-old watched it with me. She'd never seen it before and loved it--thanking me for recommending it to her. And, considering that I not only saw the film twice (that's very rare for me) and gave it a 9 in my review, I obviously was stoked to see the sequel. Too bad I was so underwhelmed by it.While my daughter said she also liked this film and said Tony Stark (Rober Downey, Jr.) was a jerk like he was in the comic books, I though he was simply a jerk--and perhaps my not reading the comic book made it harder for me to take this bothersome portrayal. Now I am NOT saying I expected him to be perfect--after all, in the first film he was truly irresponsible and sarcastic. But, in ""Iron Man 2"", you also liked him despite, or perhaps because of these flaws! In this sequel, that likable roguish quality was missing...he was simply an annoying and self-indulgent jerk. Now my perception is not everyone's, I know. Perhaps it's because I am 46 (a bit old for this sort of film) and because I haven't read a comic book in 35 years. Whatever the reason, I found it hard to love the film when I disliked the leading man so much. Heck, while he was very one-dimensional, it was often easier to like the baddie (Mickey Rourke)!! At least he had some sense of purpose in life other than his own misguided narcissism.My other serious problem with the film is the over-reliance on special effects. Too often, the film simply overloaded my senses--as it seemed bent on topping the eye-popping images of the first film. And, while it did this clearly, it did so at the expense of the plot and, more importantly, character development. As a result, I just can't see this film as anything more than eye-candy for the very easily amused and not a film with any serious depth--something that was NOT a problem with ""Iron Man"". Watch it if you want...just don't expect a lot of magic.","

"sarastro7","30 April 2010","I liked the first Iron Man movie quite a bit, but there was a good deal of things in it that I was critical of. I felt that several bits didn't work very well, and the level of excitement just wasn't that great.They sure remedied that in the sequel!! Okay, so Scarlett Johansson didn't have much to do. Okay, so a couple of minor scenes were less than realistic (like, why do Happy and Pepper stay in the wrecked car during the fight when they could just run to safety - that sort of thing). And okay, so the drone army was not that threatening and didn't pack much of a punch. Aaand, Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer was played a little bit too much for laughs. But these are very minor things. The overall mesh of plot lines, character interactions, comic book references, humor, action and sheer visual candy combined to produce the greatest entertainment value of any Marvel-based superhero movie yet. Hot damn!One of the things I liked best was the ""slow"" part in the middle where Tony watched the old film from his father, and found the structure of the new element in the ""key to the future"" model city (a city which had also actually been built, and in the center of which the climactic battle took place). Great effects, great plot element! :-) And the particle accelerator he threw together; that was massively great fun for me!There were a long list of comic book references in this movie that everyone who hasn't read the comics will naturally have missed. For instance, the reason they turned Justin Hammer into the Sam Rockwell type (Rockwell tends to play the same character, always sporting his trademark Nervous Chuckle) was to make him a comical element. In the comics that character is older and tough and very confident, but the movie version consciously parodied him in order to add more humor to the movie. Not that it needed it; it had plenty to go around!I just don't have any rally major gripe about this movie; I thought it was fabulous entertainment and much better than the first. Who SEZ this isn't the Mighty Marvel Age of Great Comic Book Movies?!9 out of 10.","

"drakula2005","30 April 2010","At first, when a heard about a second installment, i thought, i was unsure in it, because Jon Favreau is relatively new on the director's chair, so could he pull of another classic superhero movie?The answer is simple-YES! I saw it in its opening day and the theatre was full.I went along with a few friends, and all of them loved it!Here are some things, we all agreed we liked.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:It was pretty good in this movie-making aspect, although it is an action movie, there is some quite exciting development, especially the leads.Don Cheadle made a perfect substitute of Terrence Howard, and looked pretty good in the movie.So did the Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlet Johansson's heroines.For me, Scarlet is one of the most gifted and talented and in the same time, the most beautiful actresses in the last decade and even more.And last, but not least, of course, the Iron Robert Downey Jr., making one of his unique, specifically for him, roles.He is smart, funny and in the same time, well, action hero type of guy-he adds so much to this otherwise, stereotyped role.Sam Rockwell was a little irritating, but that's what his role is supposed to be, and to those who have doubts, yes, Mickey Rourke made a decent and interesting role again.TIMING:Almost perfect, except, maybe, the opening credits and a few over timed scenes afterwards, everything was alright and on the perfect spot.PLOT/STORY:I finally can say it-YES, the day has come.A day, where superhero movies haven't got just CGI, put a pretty decent story, attached to the normal amount of CGI.Well, hard to say normal, a little bit over-the-top, but nonetheless fun, when you get use to the headache.The humor was perfect, brilliantly touched to the smallest line.And most importantly-it's not that predictable-i don't mean the ending, but the development, leading to it.Excecutet skilfully, when looked from this point of view.CGI:10/10, nothing else to add.Believable Flawless.Perfect.With no big flaws or plot holes, very funny dialogue, skillful acting and good directing, Iron Man is definitely the best movie of the year so far.The perfect blockbuster as well.I'm glad a saw it, and if the first one didn't made me a fan, this one did.I can't wait to see it again.Cheers to Iron Man Amazing!

"badajoz-1","5 May 2010","Just when I thought it was safe to go back into the cinema, after the dreadfully boring disappointment of 'Avatar,' I go to see something even worse - 'Iron Man 2.' How can Hollywood spend trillions on such product? It is absolutely uninteresting, except for whether Gwyneth Paltrow is wearing her killer heels in some shots but not in others, with little action, appalling script, lax direction, and mindless high tech imagery. We spend over the first hour while Robert Downey jnr calls on all his past personal indiscretions to try and portray a super hero who is falling apart because he is dying - cue, inaudible supposedly smart ass dialogue with characters talking over each other, which is absolutely a killer and not worthy of all that Hollywood has done in the past hundred years!!!!!!!!!!!!! This film stinks, the action is useless, so-called invincible super killer drones (actually robocop lookalikes) are mown down in two seconds flat (Get bored did you, JON?), the characters not worth bothering with, repetitious to the Nth degree, and the villain (Mickey Rourke picking up his pension money)keels over inside a minute! Miss it if you can - luckily I only paid £3 or $4.50 so I got away with it. The day before Polling Day in UK and there were some nerds from Uni calling it awesome - I don't recognise my country anymore. No wonder Tony Blair got away with it for so long!","

"andro-dolic","1 May 2010","I am big lover of superhero movies and I really enjoy in them and it looks like I found myself in them . I like when I see Batman,Spiderman or maybe Iron Man . I was very surprised when last year I read article in newspapers that in 2010 is coming Iron Man 2 . This is one of the most expected movie in this year . I am surprised with more one fact . Why is movie coming a week earlier in Europe than in USA . I decided that I will watch this movie because I expected it so long . Then I saw trailer in cinema and I knew that it will be something spectacular . I was so excited and I didn't want to miss it .When I saw this movie I knew it that I can't be disappointed . Whole first impressions were great and I thought that I will again watch one masterpiece . This movie is something what I can't miss . There are maybe few things which made this movie a bit worse but I don't mind it .Jon Favreau directed this movie and he acted Happy Hogan . His directing is always full of imagination and great sense for entertainment . His funny appearance entertained me . I can still say that he didn't screw this serial . I can also say that his directing was completely different from first one because from one simple movie we got one big astonishment . I knew that i can't be disappointed with his directing . I can still say that his connecting of every part was on higher level and he got the best from whole cast .Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man was again excellent . Looks like he is enjoying in acting of this superhero . I can see that he isn't missing chance of his life because now he showed how he can be so good . Actually I like his performance from Sherlock Holmes and Iron Man . His sense for fun and great action made this movie great . I couldn't believe that from one I can say boring acting to great relaxed acting . He is again showing simplicity of one superhero . He was so realistic .Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko was great . No matter what I liked performance by Jeff Bridges but Rourke was definitely better . He made this movie great . His damn good performance deserved award ""The Best Villain in 2010"" . I can say that every his appearance was superb . If someone made this movie more amusing than first that was him . I think that he is definitely great choice by Jon Favreau . His convincing acting and something what is called sense for acting was great . I can see that he was on level .Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts was again in one difficult role and she acted her role the best that she could . I can see that she was on level maybe sometimes she had some failures but again something what we could see in first part . Her role was difficult but she found herself in it . Maybe she wasn't the best part of movie but I can't say that her performance is bad . She sometimes was in some her world but good performance .Don Cheadle as War Machine or Rhody was pretty convincing . His acting was in some cool style and I was fond of it . He surprised me so much because I didn't expect strong performance by him . There were so much parts when he was on level . I was surprised because he made big progress because of weak performance by Terrence Howard in first part . He was also great choice by Jon Favreau . I think that this movie is really better made .Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman was pretty good . She had good performance no matter what her appearance was based on her beauty what is definitely truth . Maybe sometimes she had some downs but many times she had her ups . I was very surprised because she was in some hand entertaining . Her movements were good and every scene was delighted with some her sense for appearance . I think that she is so good actress .Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury wasn't so good but he had a style . He is definitely valuable actor and you can see how his sense for acting .I think that this movie was the best of superhero movies .","

"DJAkin","16 May 2010","This movie was everything that Iron Man 1 was not. Yes, it was terrible, predictable and irritating. I was so mad how they essentially didn't even show any super hero stuff for 90% of the movie. The children in the theater kept asking their mother's: ""Mommy, where is Iron Man? I thought this was Iron Man mommy?"". The mothers had to calm their children. It was so sad. What was even more irritating was how conceited Tony Stark was. I was kind of amused by how the senator kept harassing him. For 55% of the movie - Tony Stark was pompous and an ass. He was not even remotely amusing. Then of course there is the villain who was played by an obviously uninspired Mickey Roark hoping to cash in on the success of his hit The Wrestler. He basically had a horrible Russian accent and had LIGHT SABER BULL WHIPS as a weapon. This movie was terrible. I want to sue the makers of this movie for the two hours I wasted by watching it. How am I able to get this time back? It was painful to watch this.","

"pinkliz41","30 April 2010","The hype for Iron Man 2 to be great was pretty big, by me anyway. But i was let down considerably. Sequels are usually the ones that are much harder to get right and pull of, and Iron Man 2 nearly falls flat. The last thirty minutes are diabolically bad compared to the rest of the film, which, whilst it lasted, was pretty damn good. Things that could have certainly been improved upon were; Mickey Rourke as Whiplash, who i didn't think had enough screen time, and could have been fleshed out slightly better. The introduction of War Machine fighting alongside his ally Iron Man, was completely inappropriate as it made the climactic fight sequence corny and stupid. His fight with Iron Man at Starks home was also un called for, as if the director was adding the sequence just for the sake for a longer running time. Also, Starks witty personality died out pretty quickly, so we are left annoyed and pleading him to stop by the credits.","

"Jackpollins","8 May 2010","After the surprisingly fantastic Iron Man, old and new faces join forces for Iron Man 2, an equally fantastic sequel. After long months of waiting for this film, it exceeded my expectations and made me want the Iron Man series to be never ending. There's something about Robert Downey Jr's sarcastic tone and out there charisma that suits this character (no pun intended). Mickey Rourke & Sam Rockwell are now villains Ivan & Justin, two competitors of Tony Stark (Downey, JR). Don Cheadle plays James Rhodes, AKA Warhead, Scarlett Johansson plays Natalie, Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury, Jon Favreau plays Happy, Paul Bettany plays Jarvis, Leslie Bibb plays Christine, and Garry Shandling plays Senator Stern. Guess what? They're all excellent. Shandling, especially, who has some of the funniest lines I have seen thus far this year. Rockwell has one of the funniest opening scenes in the film. There's so much to like about Iron Man 2, that, although not flawless, you forget its flaws, and just enjoy the spectacular ride you are to have. I can't decide what I want first, for Iron Man 3 to come out or for this to be in my DVD collection. Either way, see this film right away.","

"warthogjump","2 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is a great flick, not doubt about it. But, unfortunately, it fails to live up to hype and expectations of the first Iron Man.There were enjoyable action scenes in Iron Man 2. However, they didn't feel as compelling as the first one. Through each and every action scene, it's easily predictable that Iron Man will just win, so that does take out most of the enjoyment from them.There is a lot of humorous and satisfying dialogue throughout. This is probably mainly due to the stellar cast. Robert Downey is perfect, again! Sam Rockwell was probably my favourite actor in this movie as he mixes evil and comedy up very nicely. Most people didn't like him because of his attitude, but personally, he's acting is wonderful.ScarJo is sexy, but that's about it. She isn't really given much to work with and the one long action scene she is provided with seems too forced and clichéd to have any powerful affect. Don Cheadle's just there, he's not great and he's not bad, nothing too fancy about him.Samuel L. Jackson is provided with very little screen time, but I assure you, he delivers just like you would expect him to deliver. The ring on the tone of his voice is impeccable.Mickey Rourke is a fantastic villain and he really had me satisfied in every scene, but it was quite unfortunate how quickly and easily he lost the final battle. Blame the writers on that one. Using an actor with so much potential, but failing to use him to his full potential, that's just a shame.That's the acting side of it. Right about now, I'd probably give the movie an 8. But the biggest problem Iron Man 2 had is, in my opinion, the lack of continuing the storyline.A storyline was introduced with Tony's father and Rourke's father. It was mentioned here and there. Samuel L. Jackson also played particular attention to Tony's father. Yet, in the end, a storyline that was built up significantly from the beginning and the middle had hardly any affect towards the end, if any. It's almost like it was forgotten about and was merely introduced to by time. That was disappointing.Overall, Iron Man 2 will satisfy your hunger, but it will leave the dessert compartment empty and unsatisfied as it lacks many of the elements that made Iron Man 1 such a big surprise.","

"Egg_MacGuffin","20 May 2010",".SPOILERS WITHIN. ----------------- Take note, ladies and gentlemen. This is what happens when you rush a sequel into production without first having a quality script...or even a good script. This is simply a poor movie. No doubt that it's fun, but when the fundamentals are not there, you still end up dissatisfied.What is Tony Stark's goal? This is the most important part of any film story and here, it's missing. How does this happen? You can argue that his goal is to stop Whiplash, but Whiplash is never threatening anybody apart from the Monaco scene and the extreme end of the story, which is too few and far between to function as a proper goal for Stark. You can argue that his goal is to find the cure to his blood toxicity to keep himself alive, but he is only actively working toward that goal for less than 5 minutes, most of which is spent on a gag with Captain America's shield. Then he cures himself with such ease, all tension and conflict is completely killed. SO that can't be his goal, either. Hell, he spent more time driving around for the Audi commercial, which ironically meant as much to the remainder of the story as the new power cell - nothing.What is the villain's plan? First of all, who the hell is the villain: Whiplash or Justin Hammer? Hammer simply wants a defense contract, which poses a threat of zero to Stark if he succeeds in getting the contract. Whiplash has a pasted-in motivation that is as weak as a wet noodle. He fights Stark at the racetrack and then spends the remainder of the movie sitting in a room on the other side of the country, not threatening anybody at all (until the very end). It's good that he showed up with a security uniform on the off-chance that Stark would be driving a race car that day. Did anybody see where logic went? So with no villain posing any kind of threat to Stark for the entire second act of the story, and Stark having no goal of his own, we're left with a jumbled mess in the middle of the film. Stark acts out and does nothing remotely interesting or exciting because he simply has nothing else to do. His conflict with Pepper was so manufactured, I could almost hear the clatter of an assembly line every time they were together. It was entirely non-emotional, and because of that, I couldn't care.The hero and villain don't even encounter one another at all in the second act of this movie! They are off on their own doing boring crap instead.Nick Fury shows up and drops information in Stark's lap instead of Stark actually finding out for himself. Then Fury is basically gone for the remainder of the movie. Whatever the hell Scarlett Johansson's character's name was served no purpose at all. Why were these characters even in the movie? I know Scarlett was in because she got to wear tight leather and kick ass, which I personally loved, but I would appreciate it a bit more if it was somewhat story-related. Of course, you need a story first.You can argue that Scarlett had to stop Whiplash from maintaining control of the War Machine suit, but I don't even know how Whiplash gained control of it to begin with! We are never presented with that information. And if he can control War Machine, why not take control of Stark's suit? Hello? Logic? Where did you go? Logic, come back! The climax involves an long fight with drones, which becomes nothing more than robots slugging each other. In the first film, Stark was battling the technology that he created and had to learn to outsmart his opponent because he couldn't outgun him. Here, it's just mindless action. There is no threat of danger. The drones pose a threat as severe as a field mouse. Then Whiplash shows up to a scene where a battle was already fought, and they have another battle that is twice as short as the one with the drones. If you blink, you'll miss it. There is no struggle. No reversals. No tension. No anything.Why can't we have a summer action movie that is both fun and good? You can even site the first Iron Man as an example. What happened here? This movie is a complete joke and a borderline insult.But I think we all know by now that Hollywood only makes sequels because they want money, not because they have a story worth telling...or a story at all.If I didn't see this movie for free, I'd ask for my money back on account of a faulty product.","

"taylorkingston","26 May 2015","I think I like this movie as much as the first one, it's not better, it's not worse. It's a pretty entertaining movie and I really enjoy it.Now that the world knows the identity of Tony Stark and that he's really Iron Man, people have constantly been trying to recreate the Iron Man suit for their own personal gain. And the government tries to get Tony to hand over his, like that would ever happen. Tony continues to save the day until a man comes out of nowhere, with a similar suit and wreaks havoc. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.","

"sidfargas","4 May 2010","Iron Man 2 delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining humor, a complex plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Iron Man 2 is such a movie. Much like the first film, it's truly deep and complex but sacrifices none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Mark my words; Iron Man 2 is a movie people will be talking about all year if not for years to come. Iron Man 2 delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.","

"moneelvarjan","28 April 2010","Just came back from the mid night premier of the new Iron Man movie. And i have to say it lives up to all the hype that is has created.I'll try not to add any spoilers but please take note that it may contain just a few small ones.Firstly this movie doesn't feel like a second chapter in the Iron Man franchise, it feels more like a continuation of the first movie. Unlike the batman movies where begins and TDK feel like two complete different chapters of the same book, this feels more like chapter 1 part 2 of the first iron man movie.Secondly, Don Cheadle made a brilliant James Rhodes. His performance captured the character much better than Howards' did. I really wish they could have cast Cheadle from the get go. The rest of the performances were excellent as well Scarlett made a very good Black Widow for her first time i think it was very good, hopefully if she is in the third movie she will work on improving the character a bit more.Overall the movie is a great balance between the action, the comedy and the more serious points of the overall plot. Jon Favreau and his team of writers perfectly balanced all the wonderful and sometimes heavy plot lines that have been enjoyed in the comics and brought them all together in this movie. Its brilliant. I give it a 10 out 10, i left the movie feeling very satisfied and i think most fans of the comics and the movies so far will too. Oh just a tip. If your a real fan stay till after the credits roll.","

"sacflyzone","29 April 2010","This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2010, quite possibly the number one film. I really can't see anything that could possibly top this film. One of my favorite movie going experiences EVER. I was thrilled with Iron Man back in 2008 but this takes that experience and adds to it. I'm so happy to report that unlike other sequels made only for a cash grab, Iron Man 2 delivers on every front possible. There is no doubt why IM2 will be the box office smash of 2010. With good reason, the film is well worth the price of admission, more so then any movie I've seen in years. Director Jon Favreau has done it again, with great style and flair. The new actors are injected perfectly. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell and even good old Garry Shandling are exceptional. We all knew Scarlett Johansson could handle the sex appeal but she's especially good as Tony's new assistant/SHIELD operative. Don Cheadle trumps Terrance Howard's Rhodey in every way. I'm also relieved to report that Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Paltrow are even more amazing in their lead roles. They've really grown in to embodying these wonderful characters. What many don't realize but soon will is that this film has tremendous depth. The lead characters all respond to turmoil and are fleshed out beautifully. Judging by the commercials, people may expect wild action but they are going to be pleasantly surprised at the complexity and depth of the film itself. What only adds to the experience is the fact that they managed to deliver fun in to the equation. This masterpiece is one of those rare summer event movies that really does deliver something for everyone.","

"Pumpkin_Man","8 May 2010","I thought this movie was awesome and just as good as the original. It's filled to the brim with action, explosions, suspense, and comedy. The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!","

"Matt_Layden","8 February 2011","People faulted this film for being good, but not great. What the hell, so will I. Iron Man 2 has all the right ingredients to make a great summer blockbuster superhero film, yet the final product is more of what we already saw, minus the heart. Iron Man 2 has Tony Stark AKA Iron Man fighting off Ivan Vanko, a man hellbent on revenge, as well as a new arms dealer Justin Hammer. For the sake of cramming more characters in sequels, like all sequels do, we also have Natasha Romanoff/Natalie Rushman, better known as Black Widow. Black Widow, or the eye candy known as Scar Jo, adds nothing to the film for me. This was one of my worries, too much going on. Iron Man isn't overloaded like X-3 was, but it was getting there. The story is the classic revenge tale, with Mickey Rourke as the villain. A role he was only given because of his recent career revival with The Wrestler. If you watch The Expendables, you'll notice he looks exactly the same as he does here. Almost as if they were shooting next door and he wandered onto the set. Ivan, isn't that memorable as a villain (looks don't count). Rourke tried his best, but there just wasn't much there in the script. The action set pieces are entertaining enough to appeal to a younger audience. The threat level doesn't feel as big, with the addition of War Machine, again more stuff added, it just felt like we were waiting for Iron Man to succeed. The stakes simply weren't high enough for me to really care this time around.The party scene with Tony in the Iron Man suit, drunk and shooting off missiles in his house was laughable and was just added to have the two character fight each other. Superhero sequels tend to be a but better (X2, Spiderman 2) but this one just dropped the ball a bit. I don't know if the first one set the bar too high or if the filmmakers were just a bit lazy. Either way, we lost out a bit on this one.","

"Medacakathareal","7 May 2010","The new Iron Man sequel has attracted quite a bit of hype. Most of us were surprised back in 2008 that the first film had turned out not only bearable but pretty solid. The first film had walked the line between serious origin story and self-spoofing comic book comedy. The new film does the same and walks the delicate line between tension and comedic relief just as well as its predecessor.Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark one of the first super-heroes to forgo a secret identity. This eliminates what I feel is one of the weakest gimmicks of the superhero genre, the secret identity to ""protect your loved ones"". Ever notice how Peter Parker doesn't want to tell MJ who he is because she'd be in danger BUT she ends up in danger anyway? Same for Lois Lane or Rachel Dawes in Nolan's batman films. Iron Man doesn't bother with the secret identity and the story is better off for it. Instead the film focuses on the actual character of Tony Stark, including the character flaws he is known for and his relationship with his Father.The plot is really about the ""Sins of the Father"" passing on to the son. The Father of the film's villain has been wronged by Stark's Father and this leads to a high-tech revenge story. The acting is okay although I felt the script, at times, gave the actors little to work with. Even in the scenes that were fizzling out into boredom a joke or two would be thrown in to spice things up and reengage the audience. Whoever they had treat the script did a bang up job with quips, innuendos, gags and one-liners a plenty. These corny quips would be out of place in most movies but in a summer comic book blockbuster they are a MUST.Cheadle takes over from Terrence Howard as Colonel James Rhodes and while I feel he lacks the charisma Howard exuded in the first film he still does a solid job as Tony's new sidekick. The film also goes deeper into Tony's involvement with SHIELD, the legendary organization that will eventually set up the AVENGERS. Scarlett Johansson also does well in her role though honestly her beauty leaped off the IMAX screen so much I could barely concentrate on her dialogue when she was on screen.All in all the plot clips along nicely, never dwelling on the boring for too long but not letting the fast pace of the film take away from telling a good story. The Special Effects are incredible of course and some of the action scenes had the audience I saw the film with applauding. I feel the film lives up to its predecessor in almost every way and is easily worth an 8 out of 10. A solid superhero movie. I hope to see more of Iron Man on the big screen.Also, stay after the credits for a mini-sneak peak of one of the next super-heroes to get his own movie.","

"Aaron1375","13 May 2010","This film did almost the same amount of business as the first film, but a lot of people consider it an inferior film. I am not one of those people, I actually think it is just as good as the first film. The first film had a bit more polish, but this one had more bang for your buck as the last action sequence in this film has more action than all of the cation scenes in the first film put together. They did recast Rhodes in this film substituting Don Cheadle for Terrance Howard, but quite frankly I thought it was an improvement. Cheadle just has a better presence than Howard and though they recast the role because Howard wanted more money, I think it worked in favor of the studio because Cheadle is a better actor. All the other primary players are accounted for as Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark/Iron Man and Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts. The two do great as a very eccentric pair and I thought Mickey Rourke as the villain was an improvement over Bridges in the first film. I just am not seeing what others saw that make them say that this film is a worse film than the first one.The story has a man in Russia with ties to Tony's father blaming the Stark family for all the misery that he and his now dead father have had to endure. He designs his own reactor and a pair of whip like weapons. Meanwhile, Tony is having problems as the U.S. government wants the Iron Man suit and the reactor in his chest is killing him at a rapid rate. So, thinking his time is limited, Tony goes crazy trying to live every moment as if it was his last. This leads to him to giving away his possessions, wearing his Iron Man suit to his birthday party and driving a race car. It is during the race that he first comes face to face with the new villain Ivan Vanko. Vanko is stopped by Iron Man, but his stay in prison is shortened when Justin Hammer, who is desperately trying to design his own Iron Man suit springs him in the hopes Vanko can create him the suit he yearns for. Tony soon gets information on a way to save himself and it all culminates at an all out battle at the newly opened Stark expo.The movie to me was fun as they brought back most of the cast and as I said, I thought the one they had to recast was an improvement. Also, introduced in this film is Natasha Romanoff who gets to showcase her skills a bit in this film. A lot more than Hawkeye would get to showcase his in his first appearance in the first Thor film. I enjoyed the Iron Man suitcase armor in the first fight with Vanko and I liked how Vanko looked in that fight as well. Something primal as a man with just a couple of whips and slight enhancers on the body trying to challenge the hero.Once again, not sure why this one is thought of as inferior. Tony was dying, that is why he reverted a bit to the jerky out of control self. He was just trying to enjoy his last days. I heard a lot of complaining that the final fight with Vanko was not long enough, but that was only one portion of the final action scene. Before that you had Iron Man being chased by drones while Romanoff was kicking butt at Hammer industries and then you had Iron Man and War Machine fighting against the horde of drone robots. Like I stated earlier, this final action scene was long and had a lot going on. The humor was still good and there was still heart to it. To me, this film is just as good as the original and the action was actually better.","

"Faizan","1 May 2010","In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark's ego swells to enormous levels. Written as some kind of Steve Jobs meets Richard Branson amalgam in a superhero costume, Robert Downey's wise-ass treatment of the character (still at tangents to what he represents in the original comics) seems self absorbed and cheeky. How could anyone find him likable as a hero? But beyond all of this is a simple fact, this sequel fails to do what every sequel must i.e. expand on the original and take the premise into uncharted territory.Stripped down in this second outing to its bare essentials - one liners and scant cartoonish action - the films defects (glaringly obvious even in the first) conspicuously swell and rise to the surface. The story puts Stark in mortal danger; the miniature arc reactor that keeps him alive is now poisoning his body, discharging lethal toxins that weaken him and leave limited time to find a cure. Amidst this he finds himself embroiled in a wrangle with the US government over the ownership of the Iron Man armour and what it represents (weapon or instrument of peace). If all of this weren't enough, he is threatened by the random appearance of Mickey Rourke's Ivan Vanko, who as Whiplash thumps Start and his Iron Man armour in the movies best scene, set in an over-crowded Monaco racetrack.Once the initial dust has settled though, the film turns into a self absorbed, faux character study. This superhero Bucket List setup, where our hero may be dying and therefore disregards all concerns about his image and worldly perception, does not make for good entertainment. Even with all its flaws, the original film never sank to a level where it didn't amuse us, whether it was in exploring (but also exploiting) the socio-political landscape of the war on terror or Stark's guilt-stricken conscience, bruised by the extent of his organizations exploits. Because director Jon Favreau is no Sam Raimi, even his attempts at parodying the character (ala Spiderman 3) in self deprecation mode – with Tony Start dancing around in full armour on his birthday - feels embarrassingly unfunny. For action junkies, the cluttered night time scenes with Stark and Jim Rhodes (underwhelming Don Cheadle in armour as War Machine) lack the aerial panache of Iron Man fighting it out with Jet Fighters from the original.The film makes one fact glaringly obvious; comic book movies are not comic books themselves, they are movies and are expected to function in ways that films do. That Iron Man 2 doesn't is a failure that stems out of its short-sightedness to connect itself to something bigger and greater. Intended as a tie in to the upcoming, proposed (and so far non- existent) Avengers movie, it instead becomes filler for it. The movies tone implies it is a setup for the teams ultimate formation, and the blink and miss appearance of Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer, intended to provide drug like highs in audiences viewing pleasure, only confirms this observation. This is not a film but bait for a much bigger commercial franchise on the horizon and depending on how you see it, you will either enjoy it or feel duped by it.","

"deason","29 April 2010","Tony (Iron Man) Stark and supporting cast have been continuously published for up to almost half a century now; there must be something entertaining and appealing about these characters. This movie (unlike some other comicbook adaptions this century - yes, ""Azrael Begins"", I'm looking at you) actually puts recognisable versions of the published characters on the big screen.If you've been reading Iron Man for decades, as I have, then there are many resonant moments and stirring visuals that will bring a smile to your face. I don't think you can go much more than 5 minutes at a stretch without experiencing some frisson of gleeful recognition.If all you know of the character is the first movie, this will not disappoint. It has the same mix of comicbook physics, great performances and entertaining action in another script smarter than the genre usually supplies. There's a layer of enjoyment accessible to long-time readers that you won't tap into, but you won't miss it.(It was great to see Howard Stark presented as the Walt Disney of the Marvel Universe here! Great cultural shorthand.) Superior popcorn entertainment masterfully done!","

"Villings","30 April 2010","There's RDJ and his immeasurable charisma, there's Rockwell and Rourke rocking their lines, there's classy Paltrow and shallow ScarJo (bait for the horny nerds), there's good action.. and yet, something's missing. Don't get me wrong: this movie is FUN, from beginning to end. Too much talking? No way. Not enough action? Maybe, but there's plenty (2 fights, 1 'friend ruckus'). But the thread that ties it all together don't seem to be that strong (I blame it on Theroux). Anyway, go see it, you won't regret. One more thing: don't believe people telling that this movie talks way too much about the Avengers: a few bits here and there is not too much. And stay for the after-credits scene.","

"bjornjohren","29 April 2010","I went to the premiere last night and maybe it's because I've just discussed the movie with some friends that I'm still excited about it, but I truly enjoyed it. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll only state that there's old,new and more depth. That said I may be a bit on the generous side regarding my score, but it contains some of my favorite actors and the performances to go along with it. Downey Jr performance is excellent and Rourke(!) is still a hero, though my Russian is much better. ;) The incredibly beautiful ladies in this movie are as stated. One thing I thought was a pity was that Scarlett Johansson could've been given more time on the big screen, but maybe next movie will sort that out. I'm not one to criticize the directors vision and I won't, seeing as it's like the last movie, but more fun stuff. The Stark character has some funny moments that you don't want to end. Cheadle and Downey seems to have a chemistry that really works, but it may be good performances (what acting is all about). Marvel action at its best and yes... I'm easily amused.","

"amesmonde","3 May 2010","Tony Stark reveals his superhero alter ego identity and while resisting calls by the government to hand over the Iron Man technology he finds himself threatened by a new enemy. I'm happy to say there's not much to dislike about Actor/Director Jon Favreau's excellent follow up to 2008's blend of comic book action, humour and effects.Iron Man 2 picks up where the first one left off, as billionaire Tony Stark must contend with the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies played by the wonderful Sam Rockwell and the perfectly cast Mickey Rourke.Thankfully Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt and looks great as the Black Widow, although the costumes cuffs looked a little out of place. Don Cheadle unnecessarily replaces Terence Howard as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes but is just as good, phew!The leads; Gwyneth Paltrow surprisingly cast in this role returns and is the grounded back bone of the film. Robert Downey Jr. once again is fantastic as the witty extrovert Stark. There's lot of emotion as you see Stark's father and a glimpse of their relationship. Downey's acting captures Stark's battles with his mortality and his alter ego fittingly.The effects are well executed and don't detract from the action or story in anyway. Fans will enjoy nods and references including The Avengers, Captain America and Samuel L. Jackson's second Nick Fury cameo, to name a few. Again there's a great script and storyline that zips along at a nice pace backed by a fitting music score and rock tracks. Personally, I feel it's better than Iron Man due to it's sharper editing and sleeker look. Stick around until after the end credits as there is a nice teaser of another superhero. Like the Fantastic 4's films all in all Iron Man 2 is the perfect comic book flick that captures the spirit of Marvel, it's just a shame Sam Raimi's Spiderman didn't have the same perfect blend of drama, action and adventure that Iron Man has...","

"jcdugger","10 May 2010","Repeat: There's a turd in the punch bowl! This movie is a microcosm of everything wrong with Hollywood...and, unfortunately, humans in general.You see, in the most basic terms possible...people are, for the most part, stupid. There are far more of these stupid people on Earth than intelligent ones. So, if you want to sell something to these people, like a movie, you need to dial-down the intelligence level of the product. (In this way, Iron Man 2 succeeds!) For instance, let's say you want to sell a product to a group of Sarah-Palin-backing Tea Baggers. You already know, without ever meeting any of them, that this a group of people who supports a brainless political creation, one who doesn't even belong to the Tea Bagger party! (High intelligence there, eh?!) So if you were to invent a t-shirt with a saying on it, with the intention of selling it to a Tea Bagger...would you create an articulate, detailed argument on the t-shirt...or would you create something that appeals to the lowest common denominator? Would your t-shirt say something smart and factual like ""90% of Tea Baggers got a tax cut under Obama!"". Or would you just put Obama on the shirt with a Hitler mustache?! Which one is going to sell better? Same thing here with ""Iron Man 2"". A producer COULD spend $200 Million on something highly intelligent and with some redeeming value -- and sell less tickets -- or that same producer could spend the $200 Million on a bunch of special effects, A-list stars and explosions -- and sell more tickets. So, intelligent people (I'm assuming if you have read this much, you're probably more intelligent than most), we get stuck with these sorry excuses for movies all the time! And I, for one, am sick of it! Where does Iron Man 2 go wrong? Where to begin?! First off, Mickey Rourke looks like a feminine version of ""Professor Chaos""! Where did they come up with that suit design, the Johnny Weir collection?! And Gwyneth Paltrow? How does she keep getting work?! She's the ""Mark Harmon"" of actresses! In one scene, she seductively kisses the Iron Man mask -- with no human in it! (Imagine her horror when she read the script for the first time and came across that scene!) I almost felt bad for her...then I reminded myself that she is Gwyneth Paltrow! Next in line for this money-grab excuse of a movie is the usually brilliant Robert Downey Jr. If his performance were any more wooden, his nose would grow when he lied!!In my opinion, there has only been one Comic Book movie worthy of a ""10"" rating and that was ""Batman Begins"". Iron Man 2 falls woefully short of that standard. A big step back from Iron Man 1 even. Don't let the fancy CGI and big explosions fool you...this is a clunker! Thank you for reading! JD","

"brockparks","10 May 2010","I liked it a lot better than the mixed reviews I was reading would have led me to believe. It's not as fresh as the original, but the charisma and humor were there, and so were some great surprises. RDJ was amazing as always - it's hilarious that Iron Man is a funnier superhero than Spiderman, but the improv makes it work. Thumbs up! I think that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will like this as well, and enjoy a great thrill ride! And don't forget to stay after the credits for yet another Marvel movie tie-in that leads towards the inevitable Avengers movie in 2012! Don Cheadle did a good job - ScarJo was good, but not what I imagined the Black Widow to be like, but she *was* hot... And Gwyneth did her usual impeccable job. Mickey Rourke added weight to what could have been a cardboard cutout stereotype, and Sam Rockwell's character, though annoying, was well played.","

"dee.reid","15 May 2010","One of the many great pleasures of watching 2008's ""Iron Man"" was that it allowed to some degree for star Robert Downey, Jr., playing billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who moonlighted and eventually revealed to the world his secret identity as the armored superhero Iron Man, to exorcise the many demons from his lonely, drug-fueled days in the annals of Hollywood Hell. Stark, of course, has in the past dealt with debilitating bouts of alcoholism, so this role would have allowed Robert Downey, Jr. to face any remaining demons from his past. It is this deep personal struggle that has made Tony Stark/Iron Man one of the more fascinatingly introspective characters in the Marvel Comics Universe of superheroes.But whatever meditations these movies could have had in dealing with the harrowing perils of drug addiction gets lost in the bang-bang pacing, action and special effects of the latest Hollywood superhero blockbuster to boast spectacular visuals and top-notch performances but lacking any real depth or content. Actor/director Jon Favreau is quickly becoming a favorite in Hollywood, especially with the way he's handling his work on the ""Iron Man"" movies, and he proves his mettle, regardless of the lack of thematic complexity or depth that they could have had, with this sequel ""Iron Man 2."" And while I would have personally much more enjoyed the subject of Stark's internal struggles with alcoholism rather than his external struggles with the U.S. government, I guess what we get here will have to do for now.While less skillful and entertaining than its 2008 predecessor, I personally feel that I somehow enjoyed this one a lot more, perhaps because it features a more-fleshed-out supporting role from Stark's best friend Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle, having fully replaced Terrence Howard from the previous film), who of course later dawns a powered armor suit of his own to become the awesomely bad-ass War Machine. And the movie has a killer soundtrack by those Aussie bad boys AC/DC.This time out, Stark has really let his arrogance get to his head, and this is something that Downey, Jr. really pushes past its limits to become cinematic gold. He has effectively saved the world from certain doom so many times in the past that he has also effectively ""privatized world peace,"" and the government wants a piece of his technology because he has so quickly and so suddenly made them look incompetent.All that's about to change when the villainous Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) shows up on Tony's home turf one day and challenges him to a duel. Vanko is especially miffed at Stark because he believes that Stark's father stole the technology that he developed with Vanko's father and had him deported back to Russia to cover his tracks. So Ivan, possessing blueprints for Stark's technology to exact his revenge, develops some nifty little weapons of his own to become the whip-wielding super-villain Whiplash.On the home front, meanwhile, Stark's ticker is deathly ill and feels that his time is running out, and he hands over control of Stark Industries to his would-be love interest Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). And just as he does this, another character is introduced, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannson), who also hides a few secrets of her own since she is also the lethal spy/secret agent Black Widow.A lot of stuff goes on in ""Iron Man 2"" and there's the main problem (other than that other issue I mentioned earlier about Stark's battles with alcoholism getting the shaft here): a lot goes on and the movie kind of feels crammed as a result. Rourke is a fascinating presence whenever he's on the screen, which unfortunately is not very much, but I enjoyed his scenes the most, especially since he comes under the yoke of Stark's rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). Johannson's Black Widow also gets shafted as well, since she doesn't really become a big player in all this superhero stuff until the film's action-packed, 20-minute climax. And at least Cheadle's War Machine is made useful in the film before (note that I said ""before"") he and Iron Man have to go to work as a team to defeat a newly powered-up Whiplash (which is a little anti-climatic and a bit short, to say the least).Am I nit-picking some things? Probably. But the reason we keep coming back is because of the action, special effects, and Robert Downey, Jr. as Marvel Comics' Man of Steel... Iron. He's utterly perfect for this role: he's arrogant, greedy, narcissistic, and drops more biting one-liners here than Arnold Schwarzenegger ever did in his prime (not knocking the great Schwarzenegger here, but you get my point). But he's a hero, and that all that matters in ""Iron Man 2.""9/10","

"darkmax","4 May 2010","For those of you who said there is little or no story in this movie, just what were you watching? The couple making out in front of you, or were you busy attending to your SMS or email messages? Now I just got to know that Sam Rockwell was a contender for the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark in the first film, I am so glad he didn't get the part and Robert Downey Jr did.In the first movie we got to see a lot more of Iron Man, while Tony Stark stood quietly in the background. In the sequel it is Tony Stark that matters more than Iron Man. In fact Iron Man has become a mere tool for ego and fame and is beginning to become a liability to SI and tony. Unfortunately there isn't enough running time for the director to explore the deeper character of Tony Stark and his struggle with his alter ego and alcohol. Shame.Pepper Pott should have had more anger, anguish and frustration, but the character was not explored.I agree with some reviewers in saying that there is likely a spin-off in the Black Widow character. Although I must say, Scarlet Johannson's performance was a bit off. I always thought the character to be quite a bit colder, as in an ice queen.Is it me or is Samuel L. Jackson putting on tens of pounds?! I could hardly recognize him in the café scene with Robert Downey Jr!!! Shame that Sam Rockwell is still playing villain. He is quite a versatile actor who is constantly under-utilized and under appreciated.Notice how I am talking about characters and not story or the SFX? Well, for those of you watching this movie thinking there is a better story than the first, you do know that you are watching a sequel to a comic superhero screen adaptation. 30-40 years of history does not shrink well into a 2 hour movie... it won't even fit a 10 hour one.As for special effects, what else can you not expect to be thrown into a modern blockbuster like this? Heck, even the kitchen sink can be entirely CG! What's new since Jurassic Park? Overall, there is perhaps a re-watch value somewhere, but it is definitely worth the price of the ticket you pay the first time round.","

"NanoFrog","10 May 2010","Not sure i understand why writers today, for Hollywood films, just cannot write (or perhaps get approval and money) for an actual good story? While the cast is immensely pleasing and the effects nearly perfect, there is just no story here. This inability of film-makers to actually produce these special effects films which also contain at least an interesting story is a great curiosity to me. If one were a student of Marvel comics, you might recall the many great stories that the writers made around their characters. There is a great emptiness, a gratuitous over- stated violence about this film that is sad, given the audience and potential for this film.","

"socrates99","21 May 2010","You need very little persuasion to fall into this movie's utterly entertaining world. I really can't imagine anyone not liking it. Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Sam Rockwell in particular all put in near perfect, memorable performances. But it's the very well written story that carried the day, for me. It's not real deep but it's not mere window dressing either. What would Ironman do if requested to give his technology to the military? And how would he handle toe to toe competition? And there's more, but it's better you see it rather than hear about it.John Favreau is clearly gaining in skill and ambition as director while still being willing to feed our male fantasies. Scarlett is a great example as the lithesome Natasha Romanoff. No graphic novel could ever match her role for visual female sumptuousness and sheer beauty. You'll wish there was more of her though wisely Favreau leaves you slightly frustrated. All in all a fun movie way beyond my expectations. But I'm glad I'm not Favreau. What could he do to top these two movies?","

"vinnie2112","27 April 2010","I'll put it very simply, I think this movie was really cool. Excellent story, visual effects, action, all of it combined masterfully to create a great film that delivers entertainment and style throughout, without sacrificing a good plot. It has all the right elements and the cool elements in a proper balance making it fun yet not dumb.I liked a lot Iron Man 1 and I think if you also did so, then you would most likely like this one too. I really like films of this genre like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Hellboy 2, Watchmen and I think both Iron Man films are up to the level. It's great to see that this sequel is as good or even better than the first one.I absolutely recommend this movie, it kicks major ass.","

"TheUnknown837-1","13 May 2010","It was quite a challenge to top such an exhilarating, original (at least by today's storytelling standards) summer extravaganza like 2008's big hit ""Iron Man."" That film was well done on a technical level, but the reason why it is so good and why it is twice the movie that ""Transformers"" (2007) was because it used its special effects as a service to its story instead of simply relying on them to save the day. So it's a real challenge to not only build on that, but improve upon that. But by Jove, director Jon Favreau and his cast and crew have done that with flying colors with ""Iron Man 2"" which to my mind is not only better than the original, but the best film that I've seen so far this year.The movie picks up where the first one left with Robert Downey Jr.'s alcoholic, eccentric character of Tony Stark revealing his alter-ego identity as Iron Man. While he combats a power-greedy senator's strive to strip him of his technological triumph and to maintain a somewhat stable employer-employee (and sometimes romantic) relationship to his assistant Pepper Potts, again played with grace and conviction by Gwyneth Paltrow, a new villain with his own technological tools and dazzling wit (Mickey Rourke) arrives, seeking revenge not only on Stark as a person, but his legacy.It seems to be a trend these days for the second installment in superhero movie franchises to be better than the first. That was the case with Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" saga, with Christopher Nolan's marvelous reinvention of the Batman character, and now with Jon Favreau's Iron Man pictures. In my original review, I stated that I really enjoyed the first ""Iron Man"" picture but felt that its climax was a little lacking and that there were some weak zones in its plot. However, all of that is built up and enhanced with the sequel and if there is one word I can use to describe it, it is: exhilarating. Even as it builds up new story lines with new characters, some of which may be ostensibly unnecessary, it never bogs down.Like ""Spider-Man 2"", ""Iron Man 2"" brings up the plot element of the main character's alter-ego taking over his life to the point where his normal life starts to fall apart, causing him to shun his responsibilities and obligations. Although this is a sort of familiar story, the filmmakers do a great job at keeping things on the move. What's also great, and carrying down from the first picture is how it's not all grim and tough, but has effective moments of comedy such as a scene where Scarlett Johanssen reveals to a cocky boxing manager that she knows a little more about the sport than she led him to believe. And of course the highlights are conversations between Robert Downey, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow and these melodramatic moments are blended with the more traditional tones seamlessly so that it does not feel like the movie is phasing in and out of one personality, heck, like its central character.You want special effects? You got 'em. Just like in the first picture, ""Iron Man 2"" is packed with lots of explosives, bursts of action, ear-jarring sound effects, and marvelous camera tricks and cinematography to lock the audience's attention in place. But once again, these special effects, unlike the effects in ""Transformers"" and its sequel, are used as a service to the story and that is why they do not overstay their welcome. The movie saves its drawn-out climax to the end and this climax is twice as exciting as the somewhat shallow final battle of the first movie.Robert Downey Jr. is still most effective as the troubled character of Tony Stark. He's charming, witty, humorous, and believable not as a caricature, but as a human being. Gwyneth Paltrow is equally effective as Pepper Potts; Scarlett Johansson is both seductive and convincing as the new assistant who has her own way of backing herself up; Sam Rockwell does a fantastic job playing the techno-dweeb big on money but short on brawn; Mickey Rourke is sinister and cold-blooded as the villain; and Don Cheadle does a surprisingly good job taking over for Terence Howard as Tony Stark's military pal.I can't think of one person I know whom I won't recommend seeing ""Iron Man 2."" From start to finish, this is one exhilarating piece of film-making. It excels, I say, over its already exhilarating predecessor and many of its companion superhero sagas, and proves itself to be one truly enjoyable time at the movies.","

"TheLittleSongbird","12 August 2014","The first Iron Man was a great film, smart, exciting and classy with a powerhouse performance from Robert Downey Jnr. Iron Man 2 is not as good and is lacking in places, being not as classy, irreverent or exciting though it is not devoid of those qualities. The characters are not as interesting or as well-realised, Vanko is a little one-dimensional for a villain, Pepper's character is so reduced that what made her so endearing in the first is lost here and Natasha/Natalie's motivations are not as clear as they could have been. The story at times is over-familiar and cluttered with parts of the film that would have benefited from not trying to do too much and it could have had a tighter paced beginning. The script is certainly not bad with some amusing moments and one that make you think, but that of the first film has smarter humour and more intelligently structured, the film could have been longer perhaps with some subplots being explored more, the characters better developed and a little less time on some scenes, Gwyneth Paltrow was fun in the first but because of how Pepper was written she isn't anywhere near as much here and Jon Favreau's performance is rather annoying and unnecessary. Like the first film though the film looks great, with very stylish cinematography and editing, vivid location work and special effects that show a lot of time and effort and don't feel like over-load. The gadgets are also great fun and the Iron Man suit is still awesome. The music works very well, not quite as good as that of the first but it adds to the action without over-powering or bogging the pace down. The story while having a little too much going on and being over-familiar still does compel, is not too convoluted and it flows smoothly pacing-wise, and has a couple of note-worthy set pieces. There isn't a lot of action but what there is has thrills and fun aplenty, Vanko's entrance at the Grand Prix race is very dramatic and what follows is equally as thrilling and the climax while not as long as it could have been still outdoes that of the first. Favreau's direction still continues to be clever, with a mix of nostalgia for comic book fans and themes and such that would be currant by today's standard. The acting is fine, excepting Paltrow and Favreau, and there is great chemistry between them all. Robert Downey Jnr's performance is not quite a power-house but he still has the zany comic timing and the ability to give off the emotional depth needed for one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters. Mickey Rourke is menacing and a lot of fun as Vanko, Scarlett Johansson shows how well she can play fearless and Sam Rockwell plays a real weasel and does so to hilarious and sleazy perfection. Don Cheadle also performs with authority. In conclusion, not as good as the wonderful first film but is still a thoroughly decent sequel that gets most things right. 7/10 Bethany Cox","

"xtian_durden","4 May 2010","It doubled its predecessor. Bigger and better, this sequel is getting close to somewhere. Mickey Rourke was perfect in his terrifying villain, Don Cheadle earned War Machine's suit, Scarlett Johansson looks so hot in her acrobatic scenes, and Jon Favreau (the director) enjoyed his part in the movie, he gave his character (Happy Hogan) a bigger role than his previous cameo in Iron Man. I watched the first installment and the sequel both in the theater, and I must admit that I enjoyed this one much more than the first. It fills every gap in the first movie, a more startling opponent matched by upgraded weapons, the action takes us to a new level. This one is thicker than the first.

"javaman-7","5 May 2010","Java Man Reviews ""Iron Man 2"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2010.OVERVIEW: While the identity of most super heroes remains shrouded in mystery, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) has been publicly revealed as the breast-plated bad-boy known as Iron Man. Unlike Batman or Spiderman, Stark has to deal with things like Senate hearings, jealous G-Men and rival CEOs. Everyone wants the Iron Man technology. Meanwhile, over in Russia, a metallic mastermind named Ivan (Rourke) is steeling himself to challenge Stark for world supremacy. Returning from the original Iron Man are Stark's trusted assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and army liaison ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Cheadle). New characters are Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) and Nick Fury (Jackson) both of whom add a big dose of scene-stealing appeal. REVIEW: 3 of 4 Java Mugs Sequels are inevitably compared to their originals and more often than not they don't measure up. Because of the cast, this one could have been an exception: Downey is still a marvel to watch and Paltrow may be even better in this version; Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard, is also fine. Rourke and Rockwell as villains and Jackson and Johansson as intriguing spy types are all fascinating; and Shandling as the chairman of a Senate investigating committee is hilarious. But the screenplay is very much by-the-numbers, and it just doesn't add up. The captivating characters and stimulating situations which distinguished the original have given way to long and loud action sequences. But if it's action you want, you've got it; these scenes are very well done and are accompanied by lots of heavy metal music (what else?). The cinematography is also noticeably sharp with a lots of excellent aerial views. Great location work in and around California, and in Monaco during the principality's Grand Prix, also adds to the film's visual vitality. I waited in a long line to see this movie, but it was worth it because of the enthusiastic audience that surrounded me. Come early to get a good seat--and stay late through the end credits for a big hint at what may be coming next from the franchise.","

"andrewnmiller","23 February 2015","After watching the first Iron Man and enjoying it, I thought that the second would be mediocre at best. Well, I can honestly say that didn't happen because I found Iron Man 2 be just as fun and action-packed as the first one.The film starts off very nicely, with recordings from the end of the first film where Tony Stark tells the media that he is the man in the iron suit. The scene then cuts to Russia where we're introduced to our villain, Ivan Vanko watching his father dying. It appears that his father, Anton used to work with Tony's father, Howard, and somewhere down the road, Howard seized Anton's ideas and booted him to the curb and for this, Ivan swears revenge on Stark. Meanwhile, the palladium core of Tony's arc reactor that keeps him alive is slowly killing him and he can't find an alternate. He begins to become increasingly irresponsible and downhearted about his looming demise, and decides not to tell anyone about his ailment and appoints Pepper Pots as the CEO of Stark Industries and employs Natalie Rushman as his personal assistant. While racing in the Monaco Grand Prix, Tony is attacked by Vanko, but is able to fight him off. Now, Stark must get his life back together, build a new reactor and stop Vanko.While most sequels try to up the ante, Iron Man 2 comes across as a brisk and harmless film that meanders along at an attractive clip, with emotional discomfort a distant thought which is very refreshing. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the total opposite of some other comic book films. For example, it's definitely not darker than the first Iron Man and also gives itself artistic freedom to extend on the impossible. Common sense simply does not work here and Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux have a lot of freedom with the chines of reality. While the first Iron Man was an origins story, the sequel had no lack of possible roads to take, so it decided to go with the characterization road and instead of developing its universe, the movie merely takes it's cast of characters and tosses them into circumstances grimmer than before, upping the stakes but at the same time echoing the spirit of the first one. The characters are well written, each quick conversation decided with a mature bleakness that differentiates from the illegitimate situations that the film features and while the movie could be labeled as a comedy, but the humor flows so perfectly that you get the sense that it would be out of the question to write this film and not have these characters joke with one another. There are a number of themes in this movie, the most notable one being one's legacy, of what we pass on when we pass away; the impact on those who follow us and how the consequences of past actions can ricochet down the line long after someone passes on.The visual effects in this film are fantastic with lots of explosions, ear-jolting sound effects, stunning camera techniques and cinematography to keep the audience focused. As for the action, there's only a few scenes, but they all bring a lot to the movie by bringing the viewer a ton of excitement and delight, especially the finale, a 30 minute visual feast for the eyes and senses of Iron Man and War Machine battling Whiplash and his drones, which left me hungry for more. The soundtrack is darker than the first film and has some outstanding tracks along with a great soundtrack with songs by Daft Punk, Queen, and AC/DC.The acting is incredible just as it was in the first film: Gwyneth Paltrow once again proves herself as Pepper Potts, bringing a lot of sadness to the role, but is by no means a damsel in distress, not to mention she and Downey have wonderful chemistry, Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan and gets to have more fun in the movie rather than just staying behind the camera, Sam Jackson pops up again as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury sowing the seeds for later MCU films. Don Cheadle picks up right where Terrance Howard left off in the first Iron Man as Rhodey/ War Machine, stepping into the role with certainty and proves himself to be superior to Howard. Scarlett Johansson is awesome as Black Widow, proving she is more than capable of being in an action film and while she isn't on screen for much of the movie, her flight scene in the hall does leave an impact. The villains of the film as just as important as our heroes and they don't disappoint with Mickey Rourke adding a combination of a contrived show person, arrogant mastermind and an overpowering monster, while perfectly personifying Vanko's rude visage while Sam Rockwell is complete comic fodder as Tony's business rival, Justin Hammer. Rockwell kills it in this role and is a joy to watch, either when he's losing his temper with Vanko or awarding his own creations with childish enthusiasm. But the true heart and soul of Iron Man 2 comes from Robert Downey Jr. He is the mind, heart and spirit of the man in the iron suit which makes me think if the film was written especially for him. When it comes to Stark's vain personality and sarcasm, he also shines there too, providing us with a ton of great quips and laugh-out-lord moments and while Downey does portray a selfish, egotistical playboy; he is still a likable character. Much like the first one, RDJ is and will always be Iron Man.All and all, Iron Man 2 is a worthy successor to the first film, proving us with more of what we loved with more action, humor, a killer soundtrack, stellar performances and a great story. Definitely give this film a watch, you'll have a blast.","

"Meven_Stoffat","5 May 2010","I will admit that I was a tad worried about Iron Man 2, because, well let's face it, the first movie was so fantastic that it was almost untouchable. I mean, with the first movie, you had the extraordinary talents of Downey, Howard, Paltrow, Bridges and plenty more anchoring what was an incredible must-see summer slam of a movie. However, seeing the trailers for the second movie made me think ""Uh oh, Spider Man 3 all over again."" Sequels, especially superhero ones, seem to think that since they bring tons of random crap and characters into the frame, that they are always better, and as excited as I was for this movie, I felt it was going to be another one of those movies. So upon going into the theater, I kept those worries in mind.Well, I can now officially say that those worries didn't prevent me from loving the movie.Remember when Michael Bay tried to accomplish something epic with Transformers 2 with all these new characters and stuff? Well, Jon Faverau has managed to accomplish what Michael Bay never did- make a near-perfect sequel that manages to be just as great as the first. Now like the first, there's not a ton of action, but those scenes where action is absent, Faverau manages to make the most out of them. Complete with great action, laughs and characters, Iron Man 2 is the first big summer movie, and a must see on the big screen for sure, especially if you see it in digital! Iron Man 2 picks up half a year from when the first movie left off. The Stark Expo has just begun in Flushing, New York, and is to last all year. Tony, in a televised hearing, privatizes world peace. Life seems to be great, except for the fact that the reactor keeping him alive is killing him. This doesn't stop him from being Iron Man though- he continues to go on as Iron Man for the moment. He even considers replacing Pepper Potts with Natalie Rushman, appointing Potts a CEO to Stark Industries. However, in Russia, Ivan Vanko, the son of physicist Anton Vanko, having just lost his father and jealous of Stark's success, creates his own arc reactor, and becomes Whiplash, a badass villain with two electrified whips that can split anything in half with enough force.His first appearance is at a race in Monaco, and after a brief (and failed) attempt to kill Tony, he meets up with Justin Hammer, Stark's rival, and they both collaborate to build a new technology that will hopefully overthrow Tony. However, with a stint at Tony's house appointing James Rhodes as War Machine, and several other plots, Tony Stark, suffering through personal problems, doesn't know if he really can be Iron Man and resolve all this.Now the plot may not sound that great, but when you see it in the movie, you will be impressed with how complex it is. To not spoil too much, I left some stuff out, because the movie is that great. Aside from the plot, everything else is great. The acting here is fantastic! Robert Downey Jr. has his usual charm here, playing the lovable dick-head that is Tony Stark. Replacing Terrence Howard is Don Cheadle, and he does it well! I can't believe I am saying this but I actually preferred him to Howard. Howard was great but wooden in places, whereas Cheadle was great the whole way. And Scarlett Johannson whoa. When is she NEVER eye candy? As for her performance- this movie proves she is not just another pretty face. Her fight scene is just mind blowingly amazing! Mickey Rourke gives a a fantastic performance as well, and manages to shine as the villain, Of course, halfway through, the movie takes a break from the action and focuses on some character development- I was worried about it at first hearing but as I was watching the movie, I realized that sometimes, in superhero movies, character development does more than whiz-bang action. Don't worry guys, the scenes where action is absent are just as great as the scenes with action. But the action scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!! People are exaggerating the lack of action- the last 20 minutes alone has more action than the first, and is certainly more thrilling than the first too. The climax certainly is a thrill, and I gotta say I had a blast seeing it on the big screen.So in short, Iron Man 2 is a success. I had tons of fun seeing it on the big screen. A great sequel and a great standalone movie, Iron Man 2 is a sequel that truly kicks ass. Whatever worries you may have, I recommend you cast them aside, because you're in for a 2 hour fun ride. So if you wanna see a sequel that truly kicks ass, this movie is it!","

"vip_ebriega","9 May 2010","Big expectations from the original are hard to live up to, which just seems unfair to this reasonably enjoyable and exciting sequel. Going over that age-old Hollywood mantra that ""bigger is better"", this sequel throws in bigger set-pieces, better special effects and a superb cast. But unlike most sequels to successful hits, IRON MAN 2 is not only big in terms of special effects and action set-pieces, it also has stronger characters (perhaps the only real problem with that is that they're too many of them) and an even stronger plot.As with the other people who enjoyed the first IRON MAN movie, my hopes were high for the sequel. As in other superb comic-book movie sequels like SPIDER-MAN 2 and THE DARK KNIGHT, the storyline frees itself from the exposition settled in the first movie and are now able to take the story into a different direction for the sequel. Following the end of the first movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has already admitted his identity as Iron Man and, as he puts it, ""successfully privatized world peace"". Arrogant as he is, he gets the job done, but saving the world is only half the battle. Stark also has a demanding Senator Stern (Gary Shandling) on his back who wants his Iron Man technology surrendered to the military, a similarly egotistic rival (Sam Rockwell) who wants Stark and his crowning achievement be reduced to yesterday's news, and of course there's vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) bent on killing Stark to avenge his father. Only to make matters worse, the arc reactor that's keeping Stark alive is slowly poisoning his blood, and would kill him if he doesn't find a substitute to the reactor's Palladium content.There are enough characters here that could have made this as an early reunion for The Avengers, with a powerhouse of a cast to boot. In addition to the return of Downey's egotistic Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow's delightful portrayal as long-suffering assistant-turned-CEO Pepper Potts, there's also Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johnasson in a black leather suit and sporting red hair! 'Nuff said), Samuel L. Jackson's return as Nick Fury (after a very brief cameo in the first), Don Cheadle replacing Terence Howard as Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (who finally gets his ""next time"" opportunity as he dons the suit as the battle-ready War Machine), and even Favreau's Happy Hogan (nothing more than an extended cameo in the first film) gets more screen time. On the bag guy side is Rourke's disgruntled Vanko, Rockwell playing another character we would love to hate, and Shandling's hilarious portrayal of a greedy politician. Too many of these characters could have repeated the misstep that SPIDER-MAN 3 had done; too many characters with too many subplots that ruin the flow of the story. But director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux avoid this pitfall by just giving our characters enough screen time that they deserve and only throwing in subplots that actually move the story along.IRON MAN 2 is what a summer blockbuster sequel should be; it throws in everything we expect from its superb predecessor and giving is a little more without being something akin to an overstuffed, overcooked turkey. The action sequences are great in the first movie, and they're even bigger here. It even has a better, more thrilling climax than the one in he first, and more interesting and even outrageous villains than in the original. As usual, Downey Jr. is still one of the chief delights with his portrayal of a different kind of comic-book hero. Throw in a cast that looks absolutely perfect and every thrilling action set-piece in place and you have a sequel that's actually worth the wait.Rating: **** out of 5.","

"Syrchek","15 May 2010","This is one of the very few blockbuster franchises that I have followed so far. I usually see them fast, or I don't see them at all. And following the Iron Man franchise has ""payed off"", so far. But this part is different and does feel different than the first, and for some reason it's not so easy to immediately answer why exactly.The first thing that came to mind is that despite the bigger budget of the second part, the ""level"" and the time of action is the same if not shorter than in ""Iron Man 1"". I never thought that I will ever caught myself thinking that there should be more action and less talking in a so-called ""summer film"".The real substitute for all the chasing, shooting and blowing up that is a bit missing in this film, is an array of new characters. The constant talking of everyone, especially Tony Stark of course, gives the film a dynamic pace and probably makes those 2 hours go by much quicker. But from my view, the most silent character of all, Vanko, was the most interesting one.What is also specific for the Iron Man franchise and many of this kind of big films of the new millennium, is the skillful adding of ""counter-culture"" elements in a very mainstream product. This part left me down here quite a bit. The first trailer for the film had me thinking and hoping that we'll see some kind of a critique of war-profiteering and that it will all lead us to a path of at least some moral dilemmas. But sadly, all of Vanko's motives for vengeance are reduced to some old family rivalry. I guess it is (still?) too much to ask for more from a king-size summer opening film like this.","

"bob the moo","18 September 2010","Although it was of course a summer blockbuster with all the flaws that came with it, I did really enjoy the first Iron Man film for what it did well. It was breezy, light and fun and it made it an easy film to like. I was hoping for more of the same from Iron Man 2 then and it is a little disappointing to find that it cannot quite replicate the same effect. Normally I would not be overly bothered by plotting in a summer action movie but for me this is sort of the problem with IM2. It is not that the plot is bad or complicated, it is just that it seems to lack a flow to it, meaning that it stutters along quite badly, robbing it of the light touch and sense of fun that the first film relied on.We have a Russian scientist out for revenge on the Stark corporation, Stark struggling with blood poisoning from his power source, Pepper Potts taking control of the company, Justin Hammer competing for military contracts, Stark refusing to share his technology with the US military (much to the chagrin of Rhodes) and Nick Fury continuing to try and recruit Stark to his Avengers initiative. In fairness the film is not as ""busy"" as it could have been with all these characters and aspects bumping around, but it does give it a rather messy feel and the film never feels comfortable until the final action sequence around the Expo. At this point there are goodies and baddies and everyone is pulling together in the same direction and it means nothing distracts and nothing breaks up the motion in the way that happens through most of the film.This is not the same as saying the film is bad, just that it doesn't quite have that fresh feel of the first film. Stark's excesses are overplayed to the point where he is a bit hard to like. The first film balanced this well (thanks to a great turn from Downey Jr) with his wit and character taking the load, but here the first part of the film gets a bit tiresome as Stark is in one glamorous location after another without much for the viewer to ""like"" about him. This turns around gradually but again never to the point of being as good as the first film. Downey Jr is still good though and he uses his laid-back charm to good effect when he gets the chance – it is not his fault that this film is ""busier"" than the first in terms of characters, so he has less time to spread out as he once did. Cheadle is OK but I would have preferred Howard in this role; the former just seems too hard and one-note here. Paltrow is amusing in her minor role while Johansson plays to her strengths by being firey in her hair and eyes while wearing a cat suit – nothing to say on her performance as an actress but she seems happy being a sexualised action figureen so who am I to question? Rockwell is great fun though. He plays well against Downey and he brings good humour to his parts. Rourke is a nonsense but an enjoyable one, he has a good presence and his character is at least interesting, which goes some way to making up for his rather silly costume. Favreau's appearance in front of costume doesn't do much as his comedy moments aren't that funny, while Jackson is determined to keep showing up in things being ""Samuel MF'ing Jackson"" over and over again. Shandling and Slattery are nice bits of casting.It isn't an actors' film though and it is mostly about the effects. The main CGI moments are great – free flowing, well delivered, quite exciting and technically impressive. Ironically some of the ""backdrop"" effects (like where the cast are clearly getting out of a car somewhere in the world other than where they appear to be) are pretty poor – not quite 1950's back projection but still they don't look real, although it is just a minor quibble.Overall Iron Man 2 is a reasonably enjoyable summer blockbuster. It has stars, it has noise, it has cheeky humour and all your money is up there on the screen to be enjoyed. Unfortunately for the franchise it has too much clutter in it that breaks up the flow of the film and makes it too heavy to feel as fresh and fun as the first Iron Man film. It will still please the target audience and it will work as a Friday night DVD but the studio's efforts to pull the Avengers together has actually hurt this specific film, making it less enjoyable than the first film by virtue of losing sight of what worked there by piling too much on top of it.","

"brettchatz-1","7 May 2010","The inimitable Iron Man returns in an exciting sequel and fans are going to roar with excitement There's a whole lot more to Iron Man 2 than meets the eye. Purists of the Iron Man Marvel Comics genre will no doubt find many elements of the film to their liking. Such was the mastery of combining humour, action and digital effects that the film was an unqualified success.Tony Stark returns to the fold in his typical narcissistic style. In fact if egos the size of his were commonplace, the world would need several iron men. Robert Downey Jr reprises the role that he so perfectly portrayed since the first installment of the multimillion dollar series. He's witty, intelligent and noticeably a few years older! But weapons expert Tony Stark is also Iron Man and this alter-ego has a life-force all his own.The presence of Iron Man in the early parts of the stellar film is rather limited, but he soon rocks back into action and brings a roar of approval from the audience. There are scenes where the anticipation of Iron Man's arrival are like literal live-wires and it's great to see him restoring order.Mickey Rourke expertly portrays Ivan - a physicist with a bent for Stark's destruction. He's heavily muscled, wicked beyond compare and his plan to destroy Iron Man is not without its merits. But can he team up with Hammer Industries to create an army of cyborgs to destroy the Iron Man? The film has many side plots such as the budding romance between Stark and his beautiful CEO - Pepper (Paltrow). Moviegoers will love Don Cheadle's side-kick role as an apt Iron Man tag-team star. And a cameo by several heavyweight Hollywood A-listers will do more than tickle a few taste buds.The film has been accused of being unoriginal and while there are obvious overlaps with the first installment, the action is all-new and the humour is incisive. It's witty from beginning to end and it gives new meaning to the words 'tin grin.' The verdict: Do not miss the awesome action-packed superhero flick - Iron Man 2.","

"oldman007","30 April 2010","This movie will definitely be one of the best movies (if not the best) I see in 2010. Robert Downey JR returns to do Tony Stark, better and funnier than ever! Tony Stark is enjoying life as himself and as being the famous Iron Man. A huge threat comes to his attention. A man with whips is trying to kill him! With the help of Don Cheadle as War Machine, the two of them try to bring a man who calls himself Whip Lash to justice! Mickey Rourke plays the part very well! It just goes to show you've never too old to be a badass villain! Scarlet Johanson plays a very hot, but very suspicious lady! The rest of the cast are good as well.My only complaint is the middle half of the movie goes abit too slow and drags on abit. I wont reveal why, but you will see what I mean when you watch it. And Iron Man does reveal how he goes to the bathroom while wearing the Iron Man suit! I'd give this movie a 9/10.","

"Norway1","30 April 2010","I'm really torn between a rating of 7 and 8 and should probably see it again before a final verdict. But my initial feeling is this one had too much talk and too little heart.While there certainly was more action, the action scenes - especially the last - did not feel threatening at all. The one possible exception to this is the first battle between Iron Man and Whiplash - the one on the race track from the trailer.The main problem is probably too much dialog, possibly too much happening, and too little heart. Too few quiet moments. I'm not sure.My guess is the film makers heard that people loved the humor from the first (which was mostly ad-libbed from the actors) but missed more action. So they apparently gave the whole cast (of GREAT actors all around!) free reign to talk up as much as they want in each and every scene. And they added action sequence after action sequence to make up for the mere two major sequences from Iron Man 1.The end result was slightly underwhelming, yet almost satisfying.","

"Marvelouis","2 May 2010","It's clear that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play the part of Tony Stark. As he did the first time around, he portrays the perfect combination of suave and selfishness, energy and ungoverned gluttony, troubled spirit and a soul seeking redemption and responsibility. It's clear that Downey has brought everything to the part. This movie is about Stark's spiritual growth. He's certainly bitten off more than he can chew mostly because of his proclamation to end the last film. He's way overextended himself and now everything is crashing down around him. He really has to dig down deep and that's the mark of a true hero. How can the awards people keep overlooking this part? RDJ as Tony Stark is now the stuff of legend. Think Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal. Pacino as Michael Corleone. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry. John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone.Tony Stark isn't a mutant or a ninja or nothing silly has happened to him. Stark isn't a cheesy, tights wearing superhero. It's great that he can't jump into a phone booth and be on his cheesy way. He's a flawed man but he's anything but ordinary. This sequel perfectly picks up where the first film left off. Every step of the way is believable and incredibly interesting. All of the amazing effects are grounded in realism. I know they built the Iron Man armor and War Machine armor in real life and mixed it flawlessly with CG. It wasn't all a CG mishmash and all of it plays out in stunning fashion. There was a realism to everything. Using practical effects and a practical suit of armor paid off big-time. I seriously enjoyed not being able to tell the difference between a CG shot and a practical shot. The suits of armor develop a personality of their own. They communicate and allows us to see certain POV. Even the drones were amazing. There are so many great details that I truly believe this movie will be king of the multiple viewings. I can't see myself ever tiring of the action or performances.","

"jan_kalina","17 November 2010","And indeed it is. The first Iron Man came like lighting from a clear blue sky, a movie that started Robert Downey Jr's career, movie loved by audience and critics. Now there is a sequel and people are asking if it's worth it. And I say Hell Yeah.Now when the whole world knows who Iron Man is, Tony is having a hard time staying alive. There are two men coming after him, a Russian Ivan Vanko who has an unfinished business with Tony. He claims that he stole the idea for the arc reactor from his father (which of course isn't entirely true, he is a Russian, you can't believe those.) The second guy after him is actually a competitor in business, Justin Hammer, who, for years is trying to build a suit like Iron Man's but with horrible results. Now with the government wanting Tony's Iron Man suit and Stark Industries closed for business, he has a chance to become the leading weapons industry. The acting and the cast here are truly remarkable. Robert Downey Jr. is, well he is Robert Downey Jr. He is perfect as usual, you can't miss with him being cast in your movie. Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job being the love interest. Mickey Rourke doesn't have much time on screen but when he is you can see he enjoys the role and still tries to establish the character even with such limited screen time. Sam Rockwell is the comical villain and he is great at it. Samuel L. Jackson is a synonym of the word cool and he proves it once again as Nick Fury. He briefly appears but when he does he's got one of the best lines in the movie such as ""Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut."" or "" I am very real. I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet"". The weakest link in the chain is Don Cheadle. He horribly doesn't fit as James Rhodes. He is uninteresting, and he acts too serious for this role. This is supposed to be entertaining, fun movie. And when he has no idea what to do, he copies Terrence Howard's take on this character. His character changed from the best friend ever to the worst friend. He became arrogant too. He actually thinks he is better than Iron Man!! But that of course isn't true. As always there is a great little cameo by Stan Lee. I can't forget all the rush on the internet Olivia Munn being a superhero and then she had just a tiny cameo as a news reporter. I was chuckling in the theater and no one had idea why.Casting Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was the smartest idea anyone ever had. She is the sexiest woman on Earth and seeing her in a tight leather suit is worth all the money on Earth. Her only fight scene in the hallway with like a dozen guards is amazing. It is one of the best choreographed fights of this year. It is just purely awesome, sexy, full of adrenaline and even funny.I just feel like all those composers started to try again after last year's (almost) fiasco. OK, there were few exceptions, the Star Trek soundtrack, Up soundtrack and the Sherlock Holmes soundtrack. In this year there is more than just three great soundtracks and Iron Man 2 is one of them. The score is darker and more bad-ass. Three tracks that really stand out: the first track (Ivan's Metamorphosis), Monaco Drive with this heavy James Bond feel and the track titled Black Widow Kicks Ass. Soundtrack as such features songs from AC/DC, Queen and even Daft Punk.There are more action scenes in this one than in the first movie. The action scenes are much better, they are fast paced, bad ass, simply better. There is even one car chase scene.In summary, if you liked the first then I guarantee you that you will enjoy this one too, it's a must-see for any fan of Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man or a comic-books. (There are tons of comic-book references including the Avengers, Hulk and it's just great fun looking for them.) This is a great, entertaining summer movie so go and watch it.Definitely wait until the end of the credits there is a great extra scene and you find out what agent Coulson was doing in New Mexico.","

I was under the impression it was going to release on the 7th of May. Great!!I queued up and saw it, blessing my lucky stars!Wow!It's amazing to see the number of actors joining the directors club. We knew Jon Favreau was good when we saw 'Elf'. He just keeps on getting better. This is phenomenal. I am afraid this movie is not for 'artsy' type. Girls and refined folks! Advice for y'all! Keep away. This ain't your scene! This is a plain and simple hardcore action movie with a great story and even greater action. Mind blowing action! Both the movies have great scripts. Favreau is lucky with that one. And awesome actors playing them. I am not gonna give away the story. I recommend you see for yourself. If ever there was a 'Phoenix' in Hollywood, its Robert Downey Jr. A decade ago he was convicted and imprisoned. The only thing going for him was Ally Macbeal. Hollywood had written him off. Now he's headlining two big franchises. Tony Stark and Sherlock Holmes. Speaks volumes about his quality. He rose from his ashes. The other 'Phoenix' being Micky Rourke. He's just awesome as 'Whiplash'. I think i will add some 'Vankoism' in my vocabulary when i criticize any software...'Thees sooftwer ees sheeet' in a Russian accent.I know i didn't give much of a review because i don't want to prejudice any potential viewer. All i am going to say is 'You will not be disappointed'. I leave you with that note and let you judge for yourself....","

"XweAponX","26 September 2010","A couple of things we knew we were going to see - hinted at in the 1st Film - Rhodey as War Machine, the Suitcase-Suit, the dying Stark who has to drink 80 glasses of Green Machine a day, Pepper Potts as the head of Stark Industries - S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury and The Avengers - Black Widow! We get to see all of it in some form or other in this excellent Sequel. Adding to my belief that Robert Downey Jr was practically born to play Tony Stark, he builds on the first performance and reveals even more about who Iron Man is.Nothing really can be said about this that otherwise cannot be seen by simply watching the film. In Blu-Ray if Possible, on DVD if not... Looks good both ways.My only beef is that Terence Howard did not reprise the role of Rhodey/War Machine - But the addition of Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Mickey Rourke as Vanko, and Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury - Ease my initial disappointment at seeing Don Cheadle take up the mantle of War Machine - But the fact that Cheadle plays it JUST like Howard did - Even the Mannerisms, so it really IS the same Character, Cheadle does the best he can, not being Physically matched to Howard but personality-wise captured it. Also, the repeat performance of Leslie Bibb as the Vanity Fair Reporter Christine Everhart was well used- Even hinting that she was a fair Reporter, so maybe if there are any more of these, we'll get to see her come back, probably one of my favourite characters from this franchise. Finally, director Jon Favreau gets to be Happy Hogan a Lot MORE in this film much to my relief (Why recreate a great Iron Man character and only show them twice? Much better to have them in the film as much as the story can benefit by it?) The choice of Justin Theroux/Screenwriter made this a much darker story than the initial Iron Man story - As Tony builds Iron Man in the first film, this film mirrors that by having Vanko building his Arc-Reactor weApon. I thought they were bringing In Omega Red (X-Men Villain) into the story with the addition of Vanko, but apparently this is a combination of a couple of Iron Man Villains.This film is just another link in the upcoming promise of an Avengers film, and Marvel is gathering all of its forces for this effort. One thing we do know is that Iron Man WILL be a major part of The Avengers - And I ain't talking about Emma Peel!","

"jordancelticsfan","9 May 2010","I went to go see this with a friend on Saturday night. Now, I heard the film from others that this a step or two below the original, but I went in with an open mind. By the time the movie was over, I was pleased. But then, after thinking about it more, this is a disappointment. The film is drastically different in pace. Honestly, it gets a bit of a bore for awhile, which never happened in the original. Sometimes, its just hard to take this film seriously as a superhero film. In my opinion, the overwhelming number of laughs and silliness in this film makes it hard to take seriously. There is a large list of new things in this sequel. First, we learn much more about Tony Stark's father than we ever did in the original. Its quite interesting. Jon Favreau has a much, much bigger role in this film than the original, and I absolutely loved his role in the film. We learn his character has a personality. The talented Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey,and I actually liked him better in the role. They both seem so different in the role. There's Scarlette Johansson as Black Widow. I was honestly disappointed with her role in the film. It was too small, I thought. Mickey Rourke is raw and sinister as Whiplash, the main villain, and its a perfect fit. He does an absolutely perfect Russian accent. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is a good fit for the most part, although it was hard for me to take his character seriously after awhile as a villain. Sometimes, it seems like all his character does is be funny. Samuel L. Jackson has a much bigger role in this film as Nick Fury (he had a credit ending scene in the original). In a way it succeeds over the original, but for the most part it doesn't. It's missing some of the excitement and originality that made the original a truly great achievement in film. This is quite a bit different from the first, and you may not like how different it is. I certainly didn't. Many new actors, and a whole different type of ballgame. There's a bit, I think, too much silliness in this film. But still, it'll do. Go see this. Its not as fun as the first, but its not as disappointing as Spider Man 3 was. And do be sure to stay after the credits if you're a fan of Marvel Comics. Make sure you notice Stan Lee's cameo in this as well. Its rather brilliant. Overall, good film.","

"PWNYCNY","11 May 2010","This is one of the best science fiction movies Hollywood has made in many years. The middle of the movie drags a little, but it finishes strong. Robert Downey is great but the real star is Scarlet Johansson. She is beautiful; she is fantastic; she is wonderful. Her fight scenes are incredible; her overall performance is magnificent. Also she definitely has a flair for comedy. In short, Ms. Johansson is a great performer and proves it in this movie. Ten stars for Scarlet Johansson. Mickey Rourke is also excellent as the bad guy. The cgi's add to the story. This movie is actually better than the original. The Tony Stark character is further developed and the audience learns Pepper Potts' first name. This movie is a welcome addition to the science fiction genre. The movie tells a story; has interesting characters; and except for the middle part, the story moves along quickly and ends with the audience having been entertained.","

"ocacia","1 May 2010","This film is a disgrace to it's predecessor- Fact. The word redundant scenes takes on new meaning. If you were teaching a class in redundant scenes (i.e. scenes that tell you nothing, contribute nothing to the story or the plot, but just help to get the film to its status of two hours of a waste of people's time).How many scenes have no direction and could be dropped in anyplace, or to any film. What about the silly dialog? The emergence of characters based solely on their personalities, Jackson for example. You have quality actors in this film looking like very bad actors. The roles given to them and the motives of the characters are paper thin. The only person that looked mean and meant it was Rouke. How many times have we seen the Sam Jackson character. I swore he looked like Shaft returned. Anyone giving this film a rating higher than 4 has no idea about quality. It sounds bold but it is how serious I feel about this zero (if i could) rating. Last film I saw was Titans, and that was at least marginally engaging with a obvious plot, but it followed a plot - at least. Was it asking too much to have a believable story from start to end?Another film which pulls steals peoples money, and the Hollywood industry is so poor these days that people are forced to watch nonsense like this and then say it was ""fun"".","

"morgankingsley-11935","2 August 2023","I think this movie has two really great book ends. The start and the end both contain a lot of character ramifications, and a pretty good action scene respectively. But the middle part just is really hard to sit through, and takes it's sweet time making their point, for no real reason. This was the biggest ""pure set up"" MCU by far, since it was setting up for the avengers initiative, and the film really bogs down when it deals with that. Which is a shame because I really enjoy the parts about Tony learning that his father really did respect Tony, and the fact that Tony basically decided he wanted to carry his fathers legacy on. Plus the idea of him dealing with his mortality was a very good twist. But overall, the party scene and the set up just bogs the film down a notch. If it weren't for the second act I would give it a 7 or 8, but still a 6 isn't the worst rating ever just not the best.","

"colm-hearne365","23 April 2013","Granted this movie has some flaws (but what movie doesn't?) and not as thrilling as the first Iron Man movie but it's still very enjoyable and has some very good points. Pretty much all the actors do very well and are well-cast. Like we're introduced to new characters like Justin Hammer, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. We see more of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. We see Rhodey (now portrayed by Don Cheadle) become War Machine and battles along with Iron Man at the end. When I saw Cheadle as Rhodey, at first I didn't like how they changed the actor, but surprisingly he fit the role better than Terrence Howard. Robert Downey Jr. of course is spot on with his performance as Tony Stark being both arrogant and full of himself but also likable and charismatic at the same time. However, Gwyneth Paltrow was good as Pepper Potts and I liked how they showed more romance between her and Tony Stark but her nagging got kind of annoying. There's also a lot more lovely ladies in this one than the first one like Scarlett Johansson and the Ironettes. The action sequences and visual effects are very impressive too. However, the plot seems to be pretty slow in the middle but it gets better in the end.","

"Etoopia","28 April 2017","With Marvel now having 15 movies out right now, there is a lot of people on the internet always criticizing Iron Man 2 on websites & YouTube. Don't listen to them. They are wrong.You have to realize the time period when this came out. Iron Man was such a monster success and as us comic book fans, we finally got War Machine in a film. Not only that, but they incorporated Tony Stark's alcoholism into the story line which was fantastic. Iron Man 2 was THE COMIC BOOK movie at that point. I remember everyone talking about it in 2010 and loving it. It did extremely well in box office. Mickey Rourke was fresh off of his Oscar nomination from The Wrestler. Sam Rockwell just did Moon. Don Cheadle was a very acceptable replacement for War Machine.The review of this film is that this is a great comic book film. People were still in awe over The Dark Knight just two years ago, and this was more light hearted and fun. Dark Knight was depressing and dark. This was upbeat and entertaining. Mikey Rourke as Whiplash was fantastic. And his character interacting with Sam Rockwell was brilliant. They are two of my favorite actors so I'm a bit biased. Don Cheadle was actually better than Terrence Howard. And of course Robert Downey Jr and Paltrow were amazing as usual. The film's story was great. Whiplash had Tony's technology and this caused the Government to find the excuse to shut down Tony. Meanwhile, besides external forces trying to shut down Tony, he is battling alcoholism and his own struggle with the metal possibly killing him. Besides the inner demons and Govt, but Whiplash is out for revenge toward Tony. He is the Russian counterpart to Tony, brilliant, but different version of Tony Stark. Tony's rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is competing with Tony in making the most advanced weapons.The movie has Tony against the ropes. Alcoholism, Whiplash against him, Govt against him, Justin Hammer trying to take him over, his physical problems with the reactor killing him, and his affection for Pepper Potts that can not bloom due to personal issues. So much going against Tony. This inner struggle and external struggle leads to one of the best Marvel movies.The film introduces us to a deeper perspective of SHIELD led by Nick Fury who has his first decent part in a Marvel film rather than a cameo. Also, the introduction of Black Widow who goes onto to play a huge role in the MCU. Agent Coulson gets a bigger part. And there is a few tie ins to the future Marvel movies such as Capt America, Thor and Avengers (critics bashed these subplots, but ITS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE that is staying true to the source material, I enjoyed it!) Critics also said the movie didn't have enough action, but this is another part I completely disagree. The action was just enough. The race track scene was one of the most memorable action scenes in all of MCU. Iron Man 2 wasn't support to be a Transformers movie or a dumb Zack Snyder DC film, its about the character of Tony Stark and his struggles. And this film nailed it.So why all the hate ? Because people tend to have short term memory. People are so spoiled with the Avengers movies, Guardians, so many sequels for the solo heroes, more solo origin stories - that Iron Man 2 got left behind in many people's heads. They don't remember how awesome it actually was to see War Machine for the first time. They don't remember how cool it was to see Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell as villains. To sum it up - people have short term memory and are spoiled. The idiots over at Collider are in their 40's and can't even remember anything beyond 2 years ago.In the end, Iron Man 2 is a fun entertaining film. Perhaps I'm biased because I had such a great time in 2010 seeing this film in theaters and getting really big into the Iron Man franchise (I'm a Batman & Spider-Man fan). But this movie just worked so well for me. I smiled the entire time watching it.Now Iron Man 3 ? That is a terrible film. I get offended when people put IM 2 and IM 3 in the same category as 'bad ones'. Iron Man 2 is NOT a bad film, its a GREAT film and one of my favorites in the MCU.10/10","

"jon.h.ochiai","17 May 2010","In the noisy gaudy opening of ""Iron Man 2"" billionaire bad boy Tony Stark arrives at his Stark Expo in the Iron Man suit. Once removed from his body armor, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony admits, ""It's all about legacy."" Amidst the fun, high energy and stupid plot line, legacy does resonate as a poignant theme. I agree with A.O. Scott, that casting overcomes a lot in ""Iron Man 2""—I think I liked the movie more than he did. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. And Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko provides what every hero story requires: a formidable villain. Director Jon Favreau is smart in never taking the movie too seriously, letting his actors morph and evolve. Favreau provides some spectacular action and visuals. The Monte Carlo Grand Prix where Vanko attacks Stark is stunning and heroic high drama.Downey is amazing in carrying off such a wide-band character in Tony. His Tony even cops to being a text book narcissist. Downey is one of the gifted actors, whom we can discern what is going on in his mind—through his eyes. He brings a crisp intelligence, brashness, and sobering humanity here. We learn that the palladium core that keeps Tony alive is rapidly poisoning his blood and killing him. At the same time S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (cool Samuel L. Jackson) wants Tony to uncover his father Howard's legacy, and solve the mysteries of his heart—on also a more profound level. Tony confesses his estranged relationship with his Father—""He never told me that he loved me."" But in his research Tony watches a message from his Dad. He says proudly, ""You are going to change the world what has always been and always will be my greatest creation is you, Tony"" From then on I was into the movie.""Iron Man 2"" may not be a good as the first, although it has a huge upside. Scarlett Johansson is hot as S.H.I.E.L.D. ""triple agent"" Natasha Romanoff. She looks stunning in tight leather and performing Jeff Imada designed fight choreography. Beautiful and sprite Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Tony's worried assistant Pepper Potts—who Tony appoints as new CEO of Stark Industries. Tony and Pepper are so in love with each other. Will they ever figure this out by the end of the movie? You have powerful actors Downey and Rourke squaring off. Rourke is menacing and dangerous—he plays it dead on. In a subdued interrogation scene Vanko tells Tony, ""If you make God bleed, people will cease to believe in him."" Vanko is out to avenge his own father—defending his own legacy. Sam Rockwell nails the pompous and annoying Justin Hammer, Tony's industrial competitor. Gary Shandling is dead pan genius as the Senator, who demands Tony turnover Iron Man. To which Tony reminds, ""I have successfully privatized world peace."" ""Iron Man 2"" is visually stunning with the spectacular battle with the Vanko built drones at the story arc. It is also a lot of fun as self destructive Tony in Iron Man suit dances to the late Adam Goldstein's mixes. ""Iron Man 2"" is an action packed, fun, and funny mixed bag. It's not all that coherent. It's engrossing mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke, and its surprising story of legacy in spite of itself. And that works as well.","

"cultfilmfan","17 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is based upon the comic book series created by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The film is also a sequel to the 2008 film Iron Man. Basically, I figure that if you are reading this review and you are interested in seeing Iron Man 2, then you are probably a fan of the original film two years ago, the comic book series, or perhaps both. For that reason I am not going into a lengthy synopsis of the plot because the fans know what they are in for and they are the ones who are going to go and see this movie. The 2008 Iron Man film, I found to just be okay. I think the thing I really liked about it was Robert Downey Jr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He was narcissistic and arrogant and the performance was pulled off perfectly. However there was little else for me to be impressed upon in the first film because I found most of the other performances to be lacking character and emotion, the story really did not do anything for me and the action and special effects sequences went on too long and became a big part of the story, whereas I prefer more background on the characters, the hero and the villains. It was an okay film, but not great. I wasn't sure how I would like Iron Man 2 after my disappointment with the first outing of what is sure to become a series, but I actually liked Iron Man 2 better than the first film, a lot better. First of all, I found the acting a lot better in this one from everybody and the newcomers were really good also. Secondly the film gave us more of a back story to the characters and villain and I found it got more personal this second time around. Instead of just non stop action and explosions there were more scenes letting us know these characters better and I found that to be far superior and more interesting than non stop excitement from the special effects department. I also found this version to have more humour in it and there are certainly some smiles and chuckles coming your way and it made the film a lot more fun and entertaining for me than the first one. I think fans of the first one will likely be a bit disappointed with this version and the reviews tend to reflect this because it is not as action packed as the first film and I have also read complaints that people had of the writer and director trying to put too much into one two hour film. There is quite a bit going on this time around, but I did not find that the film suffered because of it. Instead, I found it gave us more to look at and think about and was a pleasant alternative to the non stop action scenes I mentioned above. The writing I also liked a lot better because it gave us more time with the characters, had a more interesting story and because some of the one liners and humour that I mentioned were in the film earlier. These last few years it seems that most superhero films have been compared to 2008's The Dark Knight because of what a great film it was and I would have to agree. I don't think you will get too many that will get the genre right and give us as interesting a look at it as in The Dark Knight, but we may yet still be surprised. Iron Man 2 while I am giving it the same rating as The Dark Knight, is not as good as The Dark Knight, but as a film in this genre, I do think it is one of the better ones. The Dark Knight was more gruesome, dark and disturbing while Iron Man 2 is definitely lighter and more kid friendly than The Dark Knight and is not as much into the development or psyches of the characters. Iron Man 2 knows this and more, or less just wants you to have a good time watching it and leave feeling entertained. For those goals Iron Man 2 succeeded and then some.","

"tieman64","9 May 2010","Perhaps because he is primarily an actor, director Jon Favreau graciously gives actor Robert Downey Jr room to run wild in ""Iron Man 2"". Favreau, who even plays Downey's servant within the film, turns the reigns almost entirely over to his leading man, every sequence designed to both make him look good, and submit us to his iron will.Indeed, Downey isn't just ""Iron Man"" in this film, he's a manic God, manipulating machines, computers, TV screens, existing 3 steps above the rest of his cast and outsmarting everyone, either physically or via witty comments. And when Iron Man's not dancing on stages, applauded by audiences or wooing women, he's taking part in action sequences which first require him to order disc jockey's to fire up some music. Every thing Downey does here is self-consciously a theatrical performance. Ironic meta-acting taken to the extreme, no longer does the action hero merely wink at the audience (""Indiana Jones"", ""Die Hard"" etc). No, meta has gone one step more meta, the actor now playing the god, playing the god, playing the god in the machine. It's not only a question of super-reflexivity, of postmodern irony squared, but rather, a kind of contempt for all material. With plot pastiched to hell, reinvigoration has nowhere else to go but inward, the actor now as fragmented and cut-and-pasted as the film he's in.Compensating for this fragmentation is Downey's own need to dominate. His need to be the deity outside the character playing the character playing the character. Compare this to the straight faced Joker in ""Dark Knight"" who, despite supposedly being an anarchist, looks completely old-school next to the freewheeling Downey (or Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow).Interestingly, unlike most superheroes, ""Iron Man"" has no need for anonymity. He's pure ego, allowed to be a celebrity, a public figure, a playboy, a rich kid, a toy maker, an invincible muscle man, a billionaire industrialist and a one man military industrial complex. While most superheroes function as power fantasies, ""Iron Man"" goes several steps beyond. He's a very white, Western, 21st century fantasy. A celebrity superhero for the reality TV generation; everyone must know his name.Whilst Favreau is gracious to Downey, submitting the film to the actor's improvisational talents, he also provides space for his film's other heavyweights – Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke - to run wild. Rockwell hams things up, Rourke goes to Brando lengths to internalise his character and Don Cheadle projects his usual air of noble earnestness. Beyond this, all three characters are poorly written.Surprisingly, the film rectifies the big mistake of the first ""Iron"" film in that it mercilessly removes much of its dull action scenes. Aside from one surprisingly good sequence in which actress Scarlett Johansen engages in a bit of martial artistry – the best pop-corn wire-work since the Nightcrawler sequence which opens ""X-Men 2"" – the film downplays action in favour for sitcom level rapid fire banter. This has ticked off audiences, but spectacle is largely dead. Most recent films praised for their action (""Avatar"" et al) are completely inept, turgid and/or outdated.Of course, thematically the film is horrendous. At times it looks as though Faverau wants to use Rourke as a tool to highlight Western blow-back, the hypocrisy of peacekeepers like Iron Man and their dark pasts, but the film steers clear of these things. It knows that treating the Rourke character seriously would take things in a direction audiences can't handle, so Rourke is repeatedly pushed off into the sidelines. The result is the usual Hollywood fascism: a message of anti-militarism married to gleeful explosions, hardware and mayhem.7.5/10 – ""Iron Man 2"" is all about Robert Downey's iron penis. About performance. About a kind of self-conscious, actorly domination, Downey dazzling us as he goes off on his insane jazz rifts. Now all the franchise needs is Shane Black and an R rating ala ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"".Worth one viewing.","

"jasonpachar","25 June 2014","The old saying goes that when people retire, they don't come back head strong. I disapprove very strongly whoever said that. When Iron Man come on the scene in 2008 as a remake of the original comic book, I said it wouldn't last. I was completely, out-of-my-freaking-mind, this movie rocked. I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!","

"ddin0","29 April 2010","First of all, if you expect to see lots of action in this movie - you will be disappointed! Basically, all the action you will see in this movie is what you saw in trailer. I know people have different tastes. I prefer action over drama and comedy, some people prefer different. So just so you know, this is written from action lovers point of view. First Iron Man had lots of action and was pumped with adrenaline, that is the biggest reason I liked it. This part just doesn't cut it for me. Here are few things I disliked a lot about this movie: there are a lot of random things in this movie, an example: while there is formula race about to begin, Tony decides to jump in one and race. I don't know if i missed some important part in this movie but I was like ""What the hell??? That makes no sense how the hell did they let him???"" or Tonies birthday party, man that was some random stuff right there. there is this agent played by Scarlett Johansson. To describe her shortly: she is James Bond 2. She can do anything: beat 20 guards? you bet, hack system made by a guy who hacked into important military system in 10sec? no problem. Just an examples, you will see through movie, don't want to spoil it for you. I expected 20-30min intro and then some epic action with great special effects, but I had to wait an hour and a half for that and it wasn't even epic! OK, movie is coming to an end, time for epic battle! Just kidding, fight is over before you say ""cookie"" stupidity of some scenes concerning highly sophisticated technology and system (also jail) security, an example: guy breaks through pentagon-like security system in 10sec, there are more things I'd like to add but I don't want to spoil it much for you as I mentioned. this movie is... boring. Talking, talking, talking, more talking, the worst part is - this talking isn't even interesting! After 30min of talking all I heard was bla, bla, bla... If at least it was something worth listening to, but only parts worth listening to were where Tony makes a good joke. Now, why did I give it a ""high"" 5/10 if it was disappointing (overall)? 1. Great special effects 2. This movie made me laugh A LOT3.Scarlett Johansson looks better then Megan Fox in Transformers.This movie should be tagged as (in this order) Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Sci-Fi and Action as last if you ask me. I don't think I wasted 2h on watching this, but I expected more, much more...","

"ZekeRage911","1 June 2010","When I saw the first Iron Man movie, I was surprised at just how competently filmed and well acted that movie was. When compared to all ""Super Hero"" movies before it, Iron Man was easily at the top. Then the Dark Knight came out and sent everyone else packing. Then Watchmen came out and everyone put their stuff away and went back to work.In short, Iron Man is the story of a very intelligent, highly flawed man who can barely keep his life together while facing super-human threats. In other words, every other Marvel character out there. But The movie is so well acted, and the dialog so perfectly askew that you really feel drawn in. It's not over-dramatic (well, a few scenes) but overall it's a solid story. When I heard the sequel would feature A. Whiplash, B. Black Widow, C. War Machine, and D. An army of Iron Man knockoff robots, I was honestly skeptical as to how the movie could possibly not be stupid.The movie was not stupid. A few parts where Tony is ruining his life because he thinks he's dying are, to be honest, a little irritating to watch. But by the end of the movie we really are on his side because he is such a likable character.A lot of people complained about replacing Rhody. In the first movie he was played by Terrance Howard, and in the second by Don Cheadle. People were angry and wanted to know why. I will tell you why. Don Cheadle can act. Terrence Howard can't. Watch his scenes in the first movie, he's blowing his lines everywhere. He's wooden, and uninteresting. Now watch Don Cheadle in the second, he's intense, he's genuine, and he's grammatically correct. ""An unfortunate training exercise occurred yesterday,"" is a line that logically makes no sense. The line is ""An unfortunate INCIDENT occurred DURING a training exercise yesterday."" If that's the take they kept, imagine what's on the cutting room floor, or more likely, ashes in Terrence Howard's agents office.Now while the whole 'secret your father left you' angle is pretty cliché and ham-handed, we quickly forget this as Stark goes back to what he does best, which is wreck his house and build a thing. He's great at building things, and watching him build things makes every nerd giddy. It's like Mythbusters but with CGI effects.Also, Jon Favreau is a very clever devil. Knowing that every fan-boy is looking for signs of the eventual Avengers movie, he coyly inserted a half-formed Captain America Shield into the 'building the thing' scene. Agent Colson picks it up, Tony Stark looks at it in wonder and says ""Yes, that's exactly what I need!"" and then uses it to prop up part of the thing he's built. Yes, friends, it's a meta-fan-boy joke.Oh, and if you DON'T want to sit through the credits to see the secret scene at the end (and trust me, it's not worth it) I will SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT! Tell you what it is. It's a crater in the middle of the desert with Thor's Hammer sticking out of it. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!! So, ultimately, is this movie worth seeing? Yes. It's probably one of the better movies to come out this summer, but then I don't get out much, so I could be wrong, but it cleaned Robin Hood's clock. Say, didn't we HAVE a gritty Robin Hood movie come out already? Prince of something something? Not of Persia? Before I ramble on any more: Surprisingly solid story, well acted, gorgeous special effects, decent action scenes, and Scarlet Johanssen is so hot even my Girlfriend's jaw dropped. It surprised the HELL out of me, I thought she was more into Gweneth.","

"mikezexcel","17 May 2010","IRON MAN 2 was as good as it gets for superhero movies. It is a well-built story using characters and situations dating back to the 1960's. (Hence the nice addition of Tony Stark's dad in filmstrip sequences). The rivalry between him and a cold war Russian inventor plays out a generation later between Tony and the inventor's son, a character known as Whiplash (but never actually called that in the movie). I have to say the writing was top-notch and the characters excellently portrayed. For any armchair psychologists out there, the child-rearing theory of nature vs. nurture surfaces in Whiplash' origin. The young boy grew up in a climate of hate, and well, this is what happens. OK, getting too deep, more on the fun stuff...Paltrow as Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, the director as ""Happy"" Hogan, and Rockwell as Justin Hammer all did a great job. Mickey Rourke dialed it down a notch and was superb. You will get some laughs from Favreau, functioning mostly as a chauffeur. Adding in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) was a stroke of genius. Her fight sequence deserved applause! A nice touch: her decorative belt rings (first seen in Spiderman issue #86, 1970) became her weapons. Very cool! There's a reason I didn't mention Don Cheadle as Rhodey. His wooden performance was the weak spot of the whole film. I don't get it because he is such a great actor. But his presence was toxic and it looked like he threw off the other actors (noticeably Downey Jr).This film is great fun, balancing character development, science (best invention - Hammer's ""Ex-wife"" missile), thrills, politics and laughs. Highly recommended.","

"tfrizzell","8 July 2010","Loud migraine-inducing sequel which is made kind of like a two hour-plus music video with enough lights, cameras, and action to keep those with short attention spans happy for a few short moments. The movie takes off where its predecessor left off as Robert Downey, Jr. (in the titled role) has become a major international celebrity, but he has issues abound as the U.S. wants his weaponry for the obvious reasons. Meanwhile, arms producer/dealer Sam Rockwell and Russian recluse Mickey Rourke come into play as the antagonists. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson make appearances to obviously set up ""Iron Man 3"" (I feel another major migraine coming on). And of course we have Gwyneth Paltrow (boring as usual as the love interest) and the usually dependable Don Cheadle (taking over for Terrence Howard who clearly knew better than to get caught in this franchise) who round out the main players in the all-star cast. Yes ""Iron Man"" makes a load of money at the box office, but critically there is not too much to talk about. Downey, Jr. seems content with playing the ham (think ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Sherlock Holmes"") as his better work (""Chaplin"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck."") seems a very distant memory. He has fun with the material and runs with it, in spite of the fact the substance is lacking in most cinematic areas. The screenplay is wishy-washy and Jon Favreau's (who also has a substantial acting role) direction does nothing to help in the end. Much like the original, this one is just a loud clunker that makes you root for the bad guys who keep up the intensity with their witty one-liners and tongue-in-cheek humor. 2.5 out of 5 stars.","

"SubZeroMK","7 May 2010","When I first heard that Iron Man was being made into a movie, I didn't care much, but I still wanted to see it because of the action. I also chose to see it because Robert Downey Jr. was playing the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark. I've been a fan of Rob since Chaplin, that was truly a masterpiece, he can work the English accent perfectly. I always thought he was English because the first movie I saw with him was Natural Born Killers, but he was obviously Australian in that.Anyways, I finished watching the movie and I was blown away by the sheer awesomeness of it. So, I chose to go back on my comic book hobby that I used to have 8 years ago. I first picked up on the World's Most Wanted storyline that is part of the Dark Reign event. I was hooked, so I decided that Iron Man is my new favourite Marvel hero, next to Blade, they're on the same level of epic. I read a famous story arc called ""Extremis"". I LOVED IT! I loved the dark tone to it, the virus created by Pharmlabs in Austin, Texas somehow slipped into some criminal's hands and he went haywire. Iron Man saved the day by taking the same dose of Extremis, he and the suit TRULY BECAME ONE, just like he says at the Senate conference in this movie. I won't say much because you'll love reading it, and it's really fun acting out the captions.Anyways, the next storyline I'm reading is Civil War, it's interesting to see his position in all of it. I still have 74 issues to go. My point is, if you're an Iron Man fan like me, and if you read the comics (which REALLY helped) then you will consider this the best movie in move-making history. I certainly do, we will see how the Avengers can top this, but I know Iron Man 3 will top Iron Man 2.Now, onto the movie. The intro starts off really well, with recordings from the ending of the first film where he announces that he is indeed Iron Man. It then cuts to Moscow, Russia where we get to see Whiplash's character intro. Truly sad to see the hand dealt to his father, Anton, apparently his father worked with Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father, and somewhere along the line, Howard took Anton's ideas and kicked him to the curb, in the Russian ghetto. Whiplash swore revenge on this, and let me just say the way the Monaco scene was setup was just AMAZING.On top of the movie being awesome, it even added humour to it, just like in the last one. Happy Hogan gets more screen time and lines. We get to see more of Nick Fury and the sexy, and seductive, Black Widow just to put the cherry on top. Justin Hammer, rival competitor to Tony Stark and Stark Industries wants to conquer over Stark Industries with H.A.M.M.E.R. advanced weapons systems. But he knows that he can never get the praise and approval of the public like Tony gets. It triggers his ego to go haywire, he truly needs Tony to succeed with his company.Moving on to the plot which is very well done and fantastic. This is a Marvel fan's wet dream come true. It combines the story lines of Armor Wars and Demon in a Bottle. Tony Stark's arc reactor is keeping him alive and killing him now, at the same time. He needs to come up with a solution and a new suit, which he does later in the course of the plot. This film is truly a masterpiece directed by none other than the prestigious Jon Favreau. Him and Robert are the DREAM TEAM as I like to call it.The audience was cheering was laughter, enjoyment and praise. They gave it a standing ovation after the movie was over, a theatre full of joy. I must admit, I really do envy Robert Downey Jr. for the kind of man he is. He has been dealt with the hand of jail and he has had his own little demon in a bottle experience,but the got back up on top, along with Mickey Rourke and has been given a second chance, and he took it.The acting was superb by all the cast members. The special effects and action had fans like myself drooling for more of it, just to appreciate the sheer beauty of it. I can guarantee you that this movie will make A LOT of money, maybe even over 1 billion and I hope it does because of the incredible hype it has received and well deserved too.The movie has a special Captain America easter egg and a secret ending after the credits. So stay in your seats. The music was very well done and in the right moments.Iron Man 2 gets my envy and full respect. This is truly the movie of the year, and possibly the decade until Iron Man 3 can top it off. People asked has the Dark Knight set standards too high for comic book movies? I'd say it didn't set them high enough, Iron Man 2 SURPASSES TDK in every way possible. This movie is godly. Rob and Jon are the dream team, never forget that people and Hollywood. They are the future of the movie industry. LONG LIVE IRON MAN!P.S. Oh and as of this year from May 6th to May 10th, you should all celebrate IRON MAN DAYS. On those four days, celebrate the great achievement Stan Lee and Jack Kirby has created.","

"Floated2","10 July 2010","I watched Iron Man 2 earlier today and I found it quite boring and annoying. I am not a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. but I liked the original Iron Man. Personally I found this film boring because of the lack of action and the amount of talking. Also another mistake of the movie was letting Don Cheadle replace Terrence Howard. Cheadle and Downey Jr. did not have the same great chemistry like Howard and Downey Jr. And Iron Man's character is very weird in this. For example their a scene where's he's at a party in his suit. That was very awkward to watch.The story is also very predictable and well not that great. While watching I was also very confused throughout the movie. I liked the villain he was cool enough but other characters were annoying like Scarlett Johanson and that other girl. Iron Man (2008) was great because they didn't overreact with the story, I just didn't really like this movie. Granted it had some good moments but not enough for me","

"Christian_Dimartino","23 May 2010","Robert Downey Jr. returns in the sequel to the film that boosted his career back up. Iron man 2. Iron man 2 has everything you want: The spectacular action, the witty dialogue of Downey, the good performances, and the babes(Scarlett Johanson we're talking to you).I knew what was expected. I was anticipating a lot. And yes it's hard making a sequel to a movie that everybody loved. So if it doesn't quite add up to the original, you have to cut them some slack. And some people have been disappointed. Me, I wasn't. I'm a little mixed as to if it was better than the original. But for a sequel, this is the best. Well, not compared to The Dark knight or Spider-man 2, but this is a worthy sequel with still a lot of greatness.Now that everybody knows that Tony Stark is Iron man,the government wants his suit. So do people like his competitor Justin Hammer(played by a funny Sam Rockwell) and Ivan Vanko(played by Mickey Rourke), a Russian scientist trying to get revenge on Tony because he believes that Tony's dad stole his dad's idea. Meanwhile, Tony promotes Pepper(played again by Gweneth Paltrow) to C.E.O. of Stark industries. He is a love triangle(sort of)between his new assistant(played by Scarlett Johanson) and Pepper. and lots of other things happen also.I know that I spoil a lot when I talk about a movie. But there is a lot to the plot here.Iron man 2 is hilarious and rather awesome at times. If it's as good as the first one is a little up in the air for me. Can't quite decide.But just know that this is the best film of Summer 2010 so far.Iron man 2: A+","

"RavenFilmsAndReviews","10 May 2010","This is one of the few sequels that certainly meets up with if not surpasses the original...Iron Man was the origin story. Now that that is out of the way the story focuses more on Tony facing the consequences of being Iron Man which is great. Robert Downey Jr. is great at delivering those sarcastic lines while remaining completely stone faced. Mickey Rourke as Ivon Vanko/Whiplash is one of the high points of the movie. His Russian accent at times is hard to understand but let's face it he himself is at times hard to understand...There is a great scene in which he ends up being held by two guards. Later he talks on the phone and all we see is blood on his hands and the two guards hanging from the ceiling....Even his death scene was great The visual effects are some of the best. During the flying sequences you feel like you are flying as well...The CGI characters have weight which is so often the downfall of CGI..This sequel comes in a close second to The Dark KnightI highly recommend it","

"gwynjones2001","3 May 2010","I saw this at a free preview in Singapore, so reviewing it seems like the least I can do. More importantly, not only was it great value for a free viewing, but I plan to pay to see it again later this week.Sequels almost always suck, so I was expecting to be disappointed, especially as I loved the first movie (and I'm not a comic book movie fan, generally).Robert Downey Jr is just great, again! Iron Man, and now IronMan 2, is warm, and funny, and entertaining... because Downey is.Supporting characters from last time (Paltrow, Cheadle, Favreau) were fine, and provided continuity. Cheadle had a bit more this time, so we got the bromance thang going.This time Stark's joined by a bunch of new characters. Sam Rockwell was thoroughly entertaining as his arch-rival Justin Hammer, very funny. Scarlett Johansson got to wear some skin-tight outfit as an ass-kicking Russian spy, nice. Samuel L. Jackson, shows up briefly (but very coolly) as a one-eyed spy boss. And the resurrected Mickey Rourke shows off his Russian accent as the vengeful genius with a grudge, and a neat turn in remote controlled drone (very topical) Iron Men.And let's not forget the Ironettes! Even the AC/DC soundtrack was OK (and I loathe AC/DC, they're so last century).If you liked Iron Man, you'll like Iron Man 2. What more do you want, buddy?","

"NORTHPOINTMJM","9 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is everything a summer movie should be, and much, much more. There's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The playboy, hard-drinking, fast-talking, now public superhero (and all the pitfalls of such fame) thrills from opening scene until the last.The movie gets everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting. Downey again brings a winning personality to play as Stark; he finds his pathos, too. Don Cheadle certainly has the acting chops to hang with Downey as does Mickey Rourke. Rourke's Whiplash is the perfect foil and perfect villain because he's no one dimensional character. His Whiplash is on a par with Heath Ledger's Joker (but with less screen time). Sam Rockwell is also perfect in his role. Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson add more sex appeal than any summer film in memory (what outfits for Scarlett) but they also deliver real performances. Pepper Potts is every bit the wise yet sexy match for Stark. The interaction and the relationships all work well and is one of the highlights of the entire movie. All the dialogue is superb. You would expect nothing less from a Jon Favreau film. (Who's also great as Happy Hogan, that fight scene raiding Hammer HQ is priceless!) A lot of superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. IM2 is darker than the first but keeps in line with the wonderful tone it already established for this character and universe. Again, Iron Man's creators mix everything so well. It leans towards dark but touches on every other tone and emotion. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they had Downey's talents to play with but Downey's performance leads to more clever banter and genuinely fun dialogue than most other movies have ever delivered, regardless of genre. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Downey's Stark is glib and even obnoxious at times but he never loses his likability and grows in to something more, drinking problems, fear of dying and all. That's true character establishment and development in a summer film!!!! What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that most every plot turn carries some emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix great acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. Oh yeah and Iron Man kicks butt again both with and against War Machine! The CG is perfect and the action is intense and very well done. That's no shocker. What was a pleasant surprise was that Iron Man 2 is now officially in the running for best movie of the year, again regardless of genre.","

"m_syrus","30 September 2010","I could not watch this movie to the end because it was so boring and predictable that it made me sick. No storyline whatsoever. It was all over the place. I guess writers could not come up with anything, so they decided to copy all the old stuff they knew and dump it in one place. Prolonged dialogs about nothing. In the best traditions of Cold War propaganda that apparently is still alive with some oldtimers, Iron man is fighting against some soviet guy who speaks his native Russian with horrible American accent. They used every single stupid cliché possible. Saving poor scared child, strong independent women wiping floor with poor ""denutted"" men, retarded dialogs , very typical happy end of course. It was like when the character takes one step you already know what the second step will be and how it all will end. When i was watching this movie i thought that the screenplay writer must be or really old and stuck in some time that had long passed or if he is young he is very stupid and out of touch with reality.","

"naman-avastol","29 April 2010","Before Iron Man was made John Favreau said he can never imagine anyone except Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and as we know RDJ's career went to a totally different level after that movie... Iron Man 2 promises the same.. Not many think that this movie could achieve the status the previous one achieved but mark my words, it will provide double entertainment as the previous one.. Sure its ending is also not up to the mark as the previous one but Robert Downey is the star his action sequences, his comic timing and his one liners are so brilliant that u might tempt to give an Oscar to him right away! Mickey Rourke as Whiplash is superb as ever! He is mean, he is strong, he is dangerous.. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is sexy and perfect, although many may complaint about not being given the full description about her character when she is introduced in the film.. Don Cheadle beats Terence Howard as John Rhodes in this movie.. But the real surprise came in the form of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer.. His performance was a delight! Gwyneth Paltrow was same as the previous one..To conclude this movie promises to deliver double awesomeness in form of action, humor, special effects and everything.. Don't Miss this one!!My Rating: 10/10","

"theblacksuit3","8 May 2010","I really liked this movie with one exception, too much unnecessary comedy. I liked how they spiced it up with all the giggles, but some of it was just too much, and it retracted from the seriousness that Iron Man is supposed to be. I also heard that black widow was useless, and her character was necessary. I was at first upset that she didn't have the accent, but it would probably conflict with Rourke's character, so its acceptable. But overall the acting was great, especially on Rourke's part, and the FX were great. And to be honest, I like Cheadle better than Howard as Rhoades, they should have gotten him in the first place.","

"Hitchcoc","29 December 2010","With the eye-popping special effects front and center, we need to again delve beneath the surface and figure what separates this from other blockbuster superhero movies. This is a fairly captivating effort, but it doesn't really advance things that much. I suppose Robert Downey looked tired because he was, after all, dying in the film, but I also got that little bit of smugness that comes from walking through the part. Still, there's a great villain who can match well and some great technology to keep things interesting. One of the demands of this is to make your protagonist somewhat vulnerable. It falls just a bit short at times in catching us. Still, I liked the byplay and the fun and don't regret having seen it. I liked the first much better because it has a more sophisticated plot and substructure.","

Rhodes, Scarlett Johansson as Romanoff and, sure, Mickey Rourke as a vilain who impresse more for its past story and for a sort of old fashion ambiguity. short, a nice film for not the fans of Marvel industry.","

"Palidan400","15 May 2010","It's fun and fast-paced. Robert Downey Jr. delivers again, with all the cast doing great jobs. Contrary to popular (critic) belief, Iron Man 2 brings another enjoyable superhero film to watch. The storyline continues to unfold, the action and effects are nice, and the actors all did well.Whatever complaints other people might have on the story, the events, the lack of or excess of - it may be true, but that doesn't make it less of a great movie. Iron Man 2 was more character driven, and you truly do see many of the past characters and new ones develop. Thanks to the well-picked cast, all of the characters were fun to watch. They gave emotion and humor together, and I'm too lazy to talk about each of them individually, but Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was definitely the savior of the whatever flaws the movie has. As he said himself, he is Iron Man, and his personality made the movie very lively.As expected, you got to see awesome Iron Man action with lots of explosions and whatnot. Some might say that there was too much mindless blasting, like Transformers, but that's what made it fun. It mixed in with the characters evenly I think, and it's an overall great and fun movie throughout.Not saying it didn't disappoint in some parts (which it did), but you can't please everyone. I find the first Iron Man to be better, but that was because it was a new, cool idea that just bursted out. However, Iron Man 2 continues as a worthy sequel. People just need to sit back and appreciate what's there.The ""ending"" is cool, too. Make sure to watch past the credits.","

"nikomailand","2 May 2010","Do you remember how you felt right after having watched 'The Empire Strikes Back'? 'The Return of the Jedi'? 'The Matrix'? Or the first Iron Man movie?If you are like me, I would guess pretty darn excited -- 'Can't wait to see what happens next'! Now try to remember how you felt after watching 'The Phantom Menace' and 'The Matrix Reloaded' -- Well, after watching two of the biggest travesties in the world of sequels... I felt completely frustrated, angry and cheated! I won't say I feel the same resentment after having watched Iron Man 2 but it comes pretty darn close.Iron Man 1? A fantastic movie! Iron Man 2? I want my money back! And my travel expenses! What is wrong with Iron Man 2? Do you have a couple of hours?Maybe...no script? Really, are these guys serious? They make a movie costing around $150 million dollars and the script SUCKS BIG TIME.Plot holes anyone? There is NO motivation: you have no idea why you should care about the characters, since the characters themselves don't have a clue what they are supposed to do or feel and why in this story. I'm not saying the actors are bad, they are doing all they can, but they are given a crappy script to work with.No sense of suspense or danger: despite one hundred of explosions and a couple of thousand stray bullets in crowded areas, NOT ONE PERSON gets killed or wounded in the whole movie! The closest you get to 'wounded' are a couple of bruises. How am I supposed to care for someone when I KNOW he won't get hurt? This is a MAJOR difference from the first Iron Man movie, where the threat was real.Somebody desperately tried to make Iron Man 2 into a movie for all ages -- well, it worked, in the worst possible way.This is also why all of the action scenes are boring, since all you see is CGI animated cartoon robots bashing into each other -- sounds a lot like Transformers you say? That's right, but with EVEN LESS human emotion, since no one gets hurt.It was pretty difficult to mess this up, but they somehow managed to do it.I've read all the rave reviews -- ""action packed!"", ""entertaining!"" ""terrific!"" Are we talking about the same movie here? Seriously guys, either you have a very low standard or you have never watched a movie that truly deserves those rave reviews, like: The Matrix and the original Star Wars trilogy. And no, I'm not comparing Iron Man 2 only to 'classic movies'. Even newer movies like Star Trek or Kick-Ass or even Iron Man 1 were ten times better! Kick-Ass was made for $30 million, instead of $150 like Iron Man 2 and it completely kicks Iron Man 2's ass in every department.I want to erase Iron Man 2 from my memory but I'm afraid it will be very difficult -- still having nightmares about Jar Jar Bings -- Thank you Iron Man 2 screenwriters, for ruining the Iron Man 1 experience for me. I wish I could sue you.Why I still give it 5 stars? Because the actors tried. And because I smiled a few times. That's it. A DVD throwaway movie at most, it really wasn't worth my money.","

"BA_Harrison","8 October 2012","The sequel to the excellent Marvel adaptation Iron Man isn't as strong as the original in the story department, being a fairly routine 'villains vs good guy' tale that does little to develop the central character; it also suffers from some interminably inane dialogue (people are talking, but they don't really seem to be saying much). Thankfully, the film compensates somewhat in terms of sheer spectacle and excitement (and I'm not just talking about Scarlett Johansson in a figure-hugging leather catsuit!).The first of Iron Man 2's incredible action set-pieces introduces Mickey Rourke's Russian villain Ivan Vanko, who causes mayhem during the Monaco Grand Prix in an effort to kill Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and thus avenge his scientist father, who he believes was cheated outed of fame and fortune by Tony's father Howard. He fails of course, but not until he's trashed several F1 cars mid-race, slicing them in half with his 'power-whips'. Great stuff!Vanko is given another chance at killing the playboy billionaire turned superhero when unscrupulous weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) busts him out of jail and gives him the means necessary to develop an army of drones. The film culminates with the inevitable smack-down between Iron Man and Vanko's obedient robot warriors, a satisfyingly chaotic battle full of big guns, grinding metal, and destruction on a massive scale.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.","

"carlosta83","28 April 2010","This Film from start to finish is genre perfection, the script the acting the cinematography the little bits of detail that makes a great film, the effects are out of this world, so good you don't even think about them. Overall this tops Spiderman 2 and by some distance i might add as the greatest comic book film to date. To start script is sharp witty, off the cuff, it quite often even verges into the Tarantino realm of dialog, so good are Downey JNR, Rockwell and Paltrow, that even the most menial of scenes become enjoyable, Rourke who was a worry for me was great not over the top and camp right on the money and also brought a great physical presence to his role. Johansson while looking the part, is the only weak point of the film for me, but even this is a minor note. But Rockwell, and Downey are close to perfection. With Rockwell having one of the better monologues in recent memory. Plot, pacing and coherence are perfect the movie just flew by didn't want it to end. There are no wasted scenes each is a treat onto itself no over indulgence or hammy dialog.Cinematography, mise'en scene, action, effects are all top notch. Sat in awe of how Iron man looks about four thousand times more realistic than spider-man, action has a really visceral impact without ever being choppy or shaky cam. Again cinematography is the major stand out and to quote R Lee Emmy film looked any better ""it would be a modern art masterpiece"" Directing is great i am now a devoted follower of Faverau he has taken all the annoying clichés and boring formulas that we keep seeing in these movies, and given us an action movie with brains brawn and the patience and execution to back it all up. There are no cop outs or annoying walls of writing where you can tell script is out of ideas and they just plonk something on the page, this is thought to the T, there is so much detail here its hard to take it all in, this one of those films you can go back and watch fifty times. From Bill O'Reilly to Amanpour from CNN, to Larry Ellison. There is something in every frame.So summing up don't listen to the pandering,sycophantic reviewers all agreeing with each other this movie is a real treat, weather your ten twenty or even fifty years old there's enough here for everyone it doesn't treat you like a 2 year nor does it go all star trek with the tech speak. This is the Comic book film we have all been waiting for go so fourth and enjoy. And Remember to stay till the end of the credits.","

But altogether, the movie doesn't have much to it. It's poorly written. Sam Rockwell made a fun introduction to Marvel as Justin Hammer, a major villain for Robert Downy Jr.'s Iron Man. Hammer is joined with Mickey Rourke's Whiplash, which isn't something I'll complain about, but both villains are a little boring. This entire movie is just Tony Stark's past coming to haunt him, and it doesn't make for a good story. There's plenty of epic moments, as I've said before, but they don't mop up the poorly written movie.","

"madhavb","8 May 2010","Jon Favreau knew exactly what he was doing with this movie. This is a sleek, no-holds barred superhero movie, with great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke. Let's face it, it was almost impossible to top the first one; nevertheless this a good sequel to one of the best superhero movies ever made. Scarlett Johansson fulfilled her role as the the sexy and cunning agent Natasha Romanoff, and Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as Pepper Potts. Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's competitor, and does a pretty good job at it.The only problem I have with this movie is that too many things have been fitted into 124 minutes. I understand that the movie was meant to be a roller-coaster ride, intended to thrill, but a little more character development would certainly have helped the movie. For example Samuel L. Jackson ans Johansson's characters are underused. Also, the ending was a little disoriented and predictable; something just didn't feel right about it.All in all, Jon Favreau has made a movie that would please the fanboys and satisfy the critics. This is a movie that entertains, while still complementing the first movie, and setting up a third movie. If you liked the first movie, just go ahead and watch this movie - you won't see a masterpiece, but you'll have a fun day at the movies.P.S.- Watch out for the after credits scene","

"aaronjbong","1 May 2010","'Iron Man 2' has been the most anticipated movie of May, and yet the year 2010. So many action scenes have been awaited in this movie including the appearance of 'War Machine', 'Whiplash', 'Black Widow' and not to forget, new armors of 'Iron Man'.Action scenes have been the most anticipated thing in this movie. Too bad, the movie didn't put a lot of fighting scenes. The fighting scenes are only a few and they are pretty short. In around 124 minutes of duration, I have expected around at least 40 minutes of those to be fighting scenes.All the visual effects and the story are not really a problem. The blasts, explosions and damage, they were pretty perfect. The details were also satisfying. Only fighting scenes were the real missing things.The fighting scene at the end was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it especially when they're up against 'Whiplash'. But, the fight was way too short. There were like only a few moves they did and done. It needs more action scenes. In total, there were like only four short fighting scenes.In summary, 'Iron Man 2' was satisfying but needs a lot more fighting scenes. But, the movie was still great. 8 stars for 'Iron Man 2'.","

Jackson, Clark Gregg, John Slattery, Jon Favreau, Paul Bettany (voice), Leslie Bibb, Garry Shandling. Downey returns in fine form as Tony Stark AKA super hero IRON MAN in this serviceable yet streamlined sequel to the franchise that has more hits-than-misses yet manages to keep its tongue-in-cheek screwball comedy underpinnings intact. This time Stark is facing two significant threats: Russkie sociopathic physicist Ivan Vanko (Rourke in top-notch menacing mode echoing Charles Bronson) whose life-long grudge against the industrialist has reached its head – and weaselly competition Justin Hammer (bantam Rockwell milking every oily turn he can) – and a threat to the global peace he has managed to uphold with his alter ego. Adding fuel to the fire are daddy issues, a diminishing heart source and doubling his pleasure with amiable administrative assistant/right-hand-babe/squeeze Pepper Potts (the lush Paltrow) and newcomer to the fold Natalie Rushman (curvaceous-to-a-fault Johansson) AKA Black Widow) while contemplating Nick Fury's (Jackson reprising his bad-ass/eye-patched hero) offer. Favreau's fluid direction (and comic side-kick theatrics) punctuates the familiar tropes yet one feels some punches may have been pulled (i.e. Cheadle is largely wasted in taking over Terrence Howard's ""Rhodey""/WarMachine and the final confrontation is frankly too quickly resolved). But fans will be chomping at the bit for the next installment and/or the promising-to-happen AVENGERS flick.","

"MovieZoo","7 May 2010","All these months of waiting on Iron Man 2 and my worst fears have been realized. You can rest assured that I am not going to glorify any of what I saw because I feel like I owe it to anyone or anything or because I was happy with at least a small part of the movie.This was like Spider-Man 3 or Superman 4 Quest for Peace. It was only a shell of a superhero movie. Why any time was spent on Tony's ailment, is a puzzle to me. Why? Because so much time is spent showing us that no ego is stronger than his.How can anyone care that he is sick? I know I didn't. Nothing endeared him to me. His self centered, near sighted outlook on life made me sick. His overinflated ego is the near death of my interest in this franchise. It is not Downey's fault, although I still wish he had not been selected as Stark in the first place.It had plenty of boom and bang tempered with ooh and ahh. Unfortunately for fans of the noise, it was short-lived in two different parts of the movie. For me, I don't care how loud the noise is or bright the flashes are as long as they are used intelligently. In my mind, that was the only thing that Favreau decided to give the fans, apparently not knowing we are not all like he is. To help you understand how much Favreau disappointed me, his presence on the screen repulsed me. When he decided to put his character in one fight scene, all I could think of was how little he must have understood what makes a superhero movie a good movie. I thought it was totally self indulgent and neglecting the attention the moment required. He just couldn't help but rush to a joke throughout the entire movie. Hopefully, this was his last shot at making a superhero movie. But wow, thanks for making money for the studio, eh? I give kudos to Rourke, Paltrow, Cheadle and Johannson. Paltrow's involvement was upgraded to a different level, showing her strengths just as she should have. And although they never got much of a chance to build much, Johansson and Cheadle made their presence very noticeable with hopes of more to expect in what I hope is a recoup of quality in Iron-Man 3(which would mean Favreau-less). My favorite scenes though were with Cheadle, as the denied friend and as War Machine. He was truly the best part of the movie. I hope Johansson comes back as Romanoff again, I liked her in this role. As little time she had on screen, this was one of her better roles. I think this character fits her fine.Rourke was a great villain. But I felt he was not quite as fearsome as the trailer made me believe. I was entirely engrossed with his character until he died. While his Vanko seemed truly capable of being evil, his demise was almost anti-climatic. His leaving the story made it even more of a disappointment because Rockwell's Hammer was allowed to live. BTW, I never liked Rockwell's Hammer because his character was as much of a joke as Favreua's take on this movie.Getting back to the loud explosions and bright lights, one scene near the end is the best example of why this Iron-Man is a great example for a weak superhero movie. While a large portion of the city is in flames, where is Iron-Man? Why, he is too busy talking to Pepper about her future. Dying children, women and men, ahhh, too busy here, folks. Iron-Man has a thing for this woman. Can't be bothered now. Give me a superhero who can't be bothered to help mankind and I give you nothing in return. I was hoping throughout the movie to see his ego fade away. Matter of fact, I had thought he learned a lesson near the end of the first Iron-Man. Guess I was wrong.4 out of 10 - plain and simple. Suggestion: wait til the DVD hits Redbox. And disregard the positive reviews for the movie itself, it sucked.","

"Wuchakk","29 March 2016","Released in 2010, ""Iron Man 2"" naturally continues where 2008's ""Iron Man"" left off. With the knowledge that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is also Iron Man being made public, he must contend with serious heart problems, Daddy issues, alcoholism, a competing rat (Sam Rockwell), a mysterious new employee (Scarlett Johansson), a personal assistant who is now CEO and who also loves him (Gwyneth Paltrow), a friend who becomes a War Machine (Don Cheadle), Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) and a vengeful Russian with ties to his father's legacy (Mickey Rourke).I like this sequel better than the popular original because I generally don't like ""origin stories,"" as far as superhero movies go. More than that, ""Iron Man 2"" brims with confidence and is just full of kinetic entertainment from beginning to end, highlighted by a rockin' soundtrack and some curvy cuties, most notably Scarlett as The Black Widow (the character's film debut). On top of this, the writers add some meatier elements to the table, like Tony's father/son issues and his sad struggle with alcoholism (which comes straight from the 80's comics, the first superhero to be depicted with this problem). The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in the Greater Los Angeles area of Southern California, Monte Carlo, Monaco, and New York City.GRADE: A-","

"euthymic89","3 May 2010","I have to admit that the first movie was better but let's not compare. In all fairness, though the ratio of dialogue to action is 3:1 (more or less), I was still caught in awe the whole time. I am deeply amazed by the power of technology that was being depicted in the movie and how Tony Stark made use of such immensely spectacular hi-tech things combined with his wit and intelligence. It was literally all in the palm of his hands.The storyline is great. It has shown another side of the Stark Industries' success and legacy which gives rise to the vendetta perpetrated by the infuriated and angst-y villain which was played really effectively by Mickey Rourke.Robert Downey Jr again affirms his compelling appeal, charm and skill on-screen. He's a really cool superhero with a mix of humor, narcissism (in a cute way), and fiercely gallant persona, not to mention HOT as hell! Scarlett Johansson is amazingly badass!! Gwyneth Paltrow is still beautiful.The movie maintained its humor which could irreproachably burst the cinema into laughter. I was expecting more funny scenes though. I guess I was expecting too much. But the serious side of storyline didn't fail me.The effects were really cool and great. This movie makes Transformers look bad. The robots here are BADDER! really badass. Pay attention to the dialogues, they are really penetrating.Watch this movie. It would live you wanting more. Truly mindblowing and kickass! P.S Stay until after the credits.","

"fighteous","29 April 2010","To classify Iron Man 2 as an archetypal sequel wouldn't justify the effortlessness in which it flows seamlessly from the original Iron Man's story; the film takes pride in picking up straight from where its predecessor left off, and in beautiful fashion. As a whole, IM2 feels more of an add-on to its predecessor and focuses on tackling the issues arising from the fallout incurred from the ending of original Iron Man.Having said that, audiences shouldn't just expect a hollow romp of recurring Stark-isms, repetitive action sequences and a predictable storyline. IM2 definitely has an edge over the original in its case of moral dilemmas and intertwining relationships between old and new characters, and to top this off the plot line of IM2 has so many unexpected and original turns that the film is so engaging it makes most other comic book adaptations appear sheepishly predictable.Having less opportunity to rely on Stark's antics to dazzle audiences, Robert Downey Jr. succeeds in adding a realistic amount of depth to Stark's character, and as such, the issues of alcoholism, sickness, mortality and the international weapons race can be tackled with a believable attitude by both the actor and the director. Thanks to a touch of genius from the writers, actors and director, these serious issues are tackled without compromising the fun, super-savvy feel of the Iron Man franchise.As a film, Iron Man 2 wasn't simply a carbon copy of Iron Man, and as such it wasn't what I expected. The film was approached in a much different way by those who made it and I think this is a very good thing. They've kept life in the Iron Man/Avengers franchise, introduced new characters without feeling like they are forcing Marvel memorabilia down your throat, and closed a dark episode in the Iron Man saga without changing the pace or tone of the franchise.For me, this movie marks a fantastic achievement for Favreau and Marvel Studios. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original Iron Man.","

"StarkTech","30 April 2010","I love this quote by Robert Downey Jr.: ""I can honestly say that Tony Stark is the coolest character I've ever played. If I look at anything, it's the mythology that has grown up around him and how I can use that to raise this movie to a really high order of art."" Mission accomplished, Robert. IM1 took the comic book genre to the highest level and IM2 builds perfectly upon the first film. Downey and Favreau again deliver a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. In fact, the action is taken to the next level while sacrificing none of the complexity or heart that made the first film a pure classic. I totally agree with most of the film critics who are praising Iron Man 2.Iron Man 2 does indeed do the near impossible and that's improve on the first film. It really is as fabulous as you've heard and as good as everyone is saying. The entire cast, the crew, the FX people and writers should all be as proud of this exceptional movie as they were of the first film. Nice job!","

"donmurray29","30 April 2010","First of, make sure you stay after the credits, again. Second, this seems to be a very wordy film.Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke have great dialogue and Don Cheadle replacing Terrance Howard is on form too, you get great action and great performances from all, a very good second film, but one more and that is it, at least you can see what is going on, unlike Transformers.You often wonder how they can do a next film after the first Iron Man was so good, well at least they handled the two main villains a lot better than I expected. Action is much harder than the last one, so try and get a digital showing, I saw at Vue in London on the 29 of April, so the crowd was small, no kids.An interesting super hero film, wait for third film to compare them all.","

"southdavid","16 February 2022","Call me a ""Thor - The Dark World"" apologist if you like, but for me, the worst film in the MCU is probably this slightly ill-fitting sequel to the one that started it all. I should say, that even though I do still think it's the worst film in the series, it's not actually all that bad, but it feels a long way away from where we'd be just a few years later.Having declared himself Iron Man to the world, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) faces criticism from his government that his suit is a weapon he wealds without oversight and should be handed over to the army. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has a vendetta against the Stark's since his father helped develop the initial arc reactor but was then disavowed and exiled. Creating his own arc reactor and powerful whip weapons, Vanko is narrowly defeated by Iron Man, but Stark's professional rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) sees an opportunity to one up his bitter competitor, he breaks him out of prison.Again, there is much setup in this film, Scarlett Johansson debuts as ""Natalie Rushman"" in a role that owes slightly more to ""the male gaze"" than I really remembered. Eventually though she suits up and we see something of what Black Widow would become. James Rhodes gets his suit. John Slattery takes over the role of Howard Stark, Garry Shandling makes the first of a couple of key appearances as Senator Stern. Kate Mara has a tiny role as a US Marshal which feels like it really ought to pay back into the MCU again somehow.The problem with the film is that it sags massively in the middle. Once the Monaco scene is over, it's almost entirely talking until the final fight, which is somehow both long and underwhelming, given how easily Ironman and War Machine despatch the drone army. I do like a lot of that talking, some of it, like the sitting in the doughnut bit has become iconic, but it's noticeable that my son (whose 10) struggled a lot more with this film than he did with the first one.Marvel's worst film is better than a lot of people could manage at their best, but it does feel like this was just a bit before Feige really nailed down the formula.","

"arnieiam","8 May 2010","First things first how did this sequel one up itself from it's predecessor? Continuity: The film takes place 6 months after Stark reveals his identity in the first film and the entire plot is driven because of that.Characters: Downey Jr. is back and his freestyle acting yet again is what brightens his screen time. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodes, which really didn't bother me that much because personally I think both Cheadle and Howard are brilliant actors. War Machine will not disappoint. Mickey Rourke plays Ivan Vanko who is a hybrid of the Crimson Dynamo and Backlash and this character should have been given more screen time. Paltrow comes back as Pepper and her ability to keep up with Downey has improved. If there is no Mandarin for this film at least they got Justin Hammer another well known foe who I think should have been the villain of the first film. Scarlett Johansson plays the Black Widow, pretty much that is a character for the male audience. And Sam Jackson plays Nick Fury.Action: It had a lot more bad-assery (hope that's a word) than the first film, a lot more. However it wasn't presented like that in the trailer, which therefore I was sort of hesitant to expect greatness. If the trailer was presented like the A-Team thats coming out this year or the first Spider-Man film eight years ago then I would have bought my ticket way in advance. But don't be mislead, there is a lot of action sequences.","

"bowmanblue","26 May 2015","Yes, the original 'Iron Man' movie was Marvel's 'surprise hit.' They were probably going to do a sequel anyway, but I'll bet they never thought they'd be pushing so heavily towards this side of the franchise. Anyway, it's fair to say that a sequel needs to give 'the same and more' and, to be fair, 'Iron Man 2' achieves this.It's bigger, louder, more special effects and more heroes/villains added into the mix. Personally, as a casual comic book-movie fan, I quite enjoyed it. I always thought most people did, until I read the online message boards, where it turned out that opinions were pretty divided on its merits.So, just to let you know that there's a sizable proportion of people out there who will disagree with me when I say that it's a pretty fun romp. No, it's not Shakespeare and it doesn't really try to be. I guess it's supposed to appeal to young fans (dare I say male fans?) who will buy the obligatory Iron Man T-shirts, Iron Man lunchboxes and Iron Man pyjamas. No, I didn't buy any of those, but I still enjoyed the film.Unlike other superheroes (think Batman, Superman and Spiderman), the 'secret' identify of our Iron Man isn't that secret, for at the end of the original film billionaire playboy Tony Stark decided to reveal to the world that he was the man in the iron mask – so to speak. Therefore, in Iron Man 2, he's an even bigger celebrity than he was simply for being the owner of a multinational arms manufacturing firm. It's actually quite nice to see an 'alter-ego' who's actually more 'ego' than anything else. Yes, he's a bit of an idiot. You probably wouldn't see Bruce Wayne getting drunk wearing the Batsuit at a party and using his Baterang to slice watermelons thrown from an adoring crowd. You see that here.Perhaps that's Iron Man's appeal – he's a bit of a plank and we can relate to his love of adoration? He is definitely a flawed – if very lucky – individual and he makes a change from the usual brooding hermit that most superheroes are portrayed as.Naturally, it's Robert Downey Jr's charm that carries the film through, but it's fair to give his supporting cast a mention. Naturally, seeing as the film's not called 'Iron Man and Friends' they have a lot less to do and a lot less material to work with. But they do okay to play off the star. If it's not a bit odd to say that Sam Rockwell's villain came across as a bit too 'comic-booky' for my liking (yes, I know it's a movie based on a comic book) – it just felt like he was trying a bit too hard.I know 'Iron Man 2' has its critics and I guess it's not perfect, but it is fun. It's nearly two hours and I always think one of the true tests of a movie is whether if feels like its runtime. And, in my opinion, Iron Man 2 flies by like a man in a yellow and red metal suit.Bust out the popcorn and enjoy.","

"TheHonestCritic","26 September 2019","""Iron Man 2"" (2010), this movie is equally as good as the first movie. What's with the hate it gets? It's definitely a worthy sequel to ""Iron Man"" (2008). Granted, it's not quite as good as the first film. But, I still consider it a perfect movie by my standards. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack. The story is a continuation after the first film. After the opening scene, it takes off with no looking back. This movie digs deeper into a strong story, with a lot going on. The first one had a lot going on, but this one has a lot more subplots. But, they are all resolved in the end, and that's what's important for a well done story. Once again, Robert Downey Jr. is pitch- perfect as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper, and Don Cheadle does a good job as Rhodey. To be honest, Don Cheadle is not as good as Terence Howard in this role. However, he does still work as a passable substitute as Rhodey. Scarlett Johansson joins the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie. She does a great job, and she puts out her second best performance in this one, out of all her roles in this franchise, with her best performance being in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014). Mickey Rourke does an excellent job as the villain; Ivan Vanko, and Sam Rockwell does a great job as Justin Hammer. The sets/locations are beautifully laid out, and work perfectly with the context of the film. Obviously, being 2010 when this film was released, the special effects are first rate. Finally, the soundtrack is well composed with the tone of this movie. Overall, this is a solid sequel, and every bit worth watching as the first movie. I never understood the unnecessary hate it gets. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. ""Iron Man 2"" is a very entertaining movie, and one of the best sequel films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. It's 100% worth a watch. I guarantee that you'll love it!","

The reason is pretty all over the place writing of the story. I mean the story itself was OK, but not its writing. The pacing also suffered as they tried to show to many things at the same time.Overall, Iron Man 2 is the worst from its trilogy. It lacked everything that first movie had.

"filipemanuelneto","16 July 2022","After an excellent first movie, this was a predictable sequel, but I have to admit that the movie is a bit over the top and that, sometimes, it feels like a very expensive video game. Furthermore, the main character, Tony Stark, is perhaps one of the nastiest and most irritating comic heroes, and this movie seems to try to accentuate that by turning the protagonist into a spoiled playboy who has expensive toys and looks at women like if they were, also, toys. Okay, I know the character was also portrayed like that in the original books, even though I'm not a comics fan. But the movie could give something that made Tony Stark someone we could really care about.In this film, the hero will face his first great antagonist, the son of a Soviet scientist that Stark's father knew. At the same time, Stark has to face the US Army, who are eager to get their hands on the combat suits he created, discovering that his father knew of a new chemical element, not yet officially discovered, and in which lies the key for the survival of Stark himself. With these brief lines, we can see, right away, that the script is not exactly one of the strong points of the film. The feeling that remains is that the script shoots in several directions, trying to create a more complex story, but that something got in the way and prevented that objective.The cast basically has the same names as the previous film. Robert Downey Jr. Is back to the red armor for yet another film, where he has shown himself to be deftly sarcastic and irritating without losing his heroic pose. Mickey Rourke is a welcome addition to the cast, playing the villain. The actor was able to adapt to the character quite competently. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also return, but they don't do more than they did in the previous film, still fulfilling what was asked of them. Scarlett Johansson deserves a praise for her work here, but the rest of the cast just do what needs to be done.The film is yet another very expensive blockbuster, abundantly financed by Marvel, and it is very obvious that it will become one of the most watched films of the season. With so much money and financial interest involved, the film was doomed to a loud and flashy bet on high-quality, but still obviously false, effects and CGI. The film has a lot of action and the fights are excellent, although obviously choreographed and stilted. The cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and magnificently beautiful. The film bets a lot on quality props, good sets and costumes, as well as a good soundtrack.","

The film is deeper in the story, the characters are as funny and charming as ever with the edition of some new characters, and action to keep you happy and satisfied through-out the entire film.In this film we see how Tony Stark is now a big celebrity and has helped bring what seems to be world peace. However, he has enemies on the move and are going to try and show the world that even Iron Man can bleed. So now with time running out and new mysteries about his own past to solve, Tony has a lot to do for this exciting follow-up to the 2008 blockbuster.The film has everything the average summer movie-goer wants to see in a film, great action, beautiful special effects, well-written script, and characters that you just have to love. Iron Man 2 in my opinion is better than the first and is probably one of the best superhero films ever made.","

This is a CGI show and it's pretty good. But, the story suffered badly from a very bad script especially in the beginning when the audience needs to be grabbed. Much of the dialogues seemed dubbed in, just like in Iron Man 1. Not much had changed. Downey and Rourke come off better than anyone else in the cast. Paltrow seemed lost again like in Iron Man 1. Johansson, while still looking good, was wasted except for some Karate, Kung Fu and JuJitsu stuff if that was really her. Looked good though with those moves, whoever it was. Don Cheadle needs to stop being the second fiddle sidekick, and needs to find his own movie again like Rwanda. He is truly wasted in here. Rockwell seemed tentative in his bad guy role. Jackson seemed disappointed that he couldn't pontificate more. Like I said, this is a CGI show and it was spectacular, but the script really hurt the effort. Again, there is dumb and there is this. Let's all light a candle and hope there is no Iron Man 3. Now, if you are a true Iron Man fan, go read the comic instead. It's far better than anything Hollywood could do.Violence: Yes.

Terrence did a good job, Don Cheadle doesn't fit in (although he was great in Traitor) Mrs. Paltrow is just annoying, annoying, annoying; Samuel L.

"theaxekeeper","10 May 2010","Tony Stark, is back in this high-octane, high action summer blockbuster. The film picks up right where the first one left off, where Stark reveals that he is Iron Man. We are introduced to a new villain named Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke. We soon find out that he and Mr. Stark have much in common with their past. Meanwhile Jimmy Rhodes, played wonderfully by Don Cheadle, must deal with the government and Stark's crazy antics. This is just a reader's digest version of the story, I want to talk about the film itself. This film is the first of this summer's blockbusters. This film is bigger, louder and more action packed than it's predecessor, which not necessarily a bad thing. With the addition of Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson really brings a ""freshness"" to the story. Director Jon Favreau has done another fantastic job, proving that he is a first rate action director. The characters are great, Paltrow gives a great supporting performance, Downey is funny and series as ever, and Rourke is a force to be reckoned with. The visual affects are very good along with solid sound editing, however, I do feel that Johansson and Sam L. Jackson, where a but underutilized. I really enjoyed this film, but I was hoping to see more from these characters. That's what sequels are for. I do like this film, but it did lack in some parts where the first one succeeded. I do love the special affects, but they could have been better. Unfortunately with the passing of special affects wizard, Stan Winston, who worked on the first film, it did loose a little luster but not much. Overall I was a satisfied as a moviegoer and a future film maker, I would definitely go see this film again. It is worth your money, but unfortunately, it will probably be overshadowed by the mind-numbing, horribly acted, D rated special affects, crapfest known as ""Twilight"".

"ironhorse_iv","3 July 2013","Directed by once again Jon Favreau, Iron Man 2 in my opinion fault to live up to the original movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not awful movie. It was pretty OK for what it is. A popcorn flick. It just wasn't as good as the original, but hey it's still worth noting. Iron Man 2 was more a comedy than an action movie. Iron Man 2 starts out, with after the events of the first movie. Stark has just revealed his identity as Iron Man and is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the technology. Meanwhile, in Russia, scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to seek revenge against Tony Stark (Robert Downing Jr.) as he believes that Stark stole his father's technology. Mickey Rouke as Ivan Vanko isn't a bad choice, but his character had little to no development. While the movie would love to point out that he is Whiplash from the comic books, in truth, he was on film a combination between Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo (the original Anton Vanco). Both Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo in the comics wore more body armor than the guy in the movie. Most of the movie, you see him fail into everything he does. In no way, does I see him as a seriously threat to Iron Man. The movie could have made him sinister, but gladly use him as comedy with a running gag about getting a bird. Also in most of the film, we don't even see Iron Man in action. Tony Stark literally spent the last half of the movie in his basement making the ultimate suit to fight a ton of drones that went out like a candle in the wind. The thing that annoyed me about it was how his father's intention for this incredible, impossible to create super-sustainer type thing that will changed the world, is made in like 2 days by Tony Stark and is essentially used to replace a double-A battery in his chest. Trying not to spoil the whole movie, but I found the ending fights really disappointing. 23 minutes of action in 124 min film is too little for a blockbuster film, far less than Iron Man. Even the middle fight in the film is pretty much pointless as it waste time. It's remind me of the fighting scene in 1988's They Live where the two heroes duking it out for little to no reason just for comedy. I think all the comedy, hurt the story ark for Tony Stark's depression, alcoholic, and poisoning arch. It was never taken serious in many scenes. I was really hoping for 'Demon in a Bottle' like story arc. Sadly as long as Disney Marvel control the movies. There will never be a Demon in a Bottle storyline. Plus, I don't even think Monaco Grand Prix would have allow a clearly smashed, poison and untrained driver Tony Stark to drive a racing car in a race with other drivers. We came to see Iron Man, and what did we get 2 short action scenes, a depressing finale, and tons of Avengers references. So there were a lot of Easter Eggs in this movie, but I didn't get a trip on it as much as I hope. I mark a little bit, I have little interest in it. Back to the movie in hand, all actors and actresses did swell jobs, but the one that really broke out of its shell was Sam Rockwell as Rival defense contractor Justin Hammer. So let me see the bad guy in the first Iron Man was a white business tycoon, using an ethic minority as a cover for their own plot, the second was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, and the third was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, true inspiration there. Tony Stark's sidekick, Colonel James Rhodes went through a change, too. Terrence Howard got replaced by Don Cheadle. What I believe is the reason why, was because Terrence was overpaid for the first movie, they slashed his pay for the sequel drastically. Once Howard's agents were informed they were taken aback at the huge pay cut. He back down. The studio had always wanted Cheadle for the part, Howard says. It's weird that Colonel James Rhodes can control War Machine armor so quickly in this film, while it took a while for Tony Starks to get uses to being Iron Man in the first movie. Scarlett Johansson is sexy as Black Widow, but her character development wasn't there. She was pretty much in the movie because she's eye candy to the comic book fans. Talking about eye candy, Gwyneth Paltrow is just there to suck up screen time as Tony's love interest, Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts. Iron Man 2 had some bad dialogue. Characters often talked, but there was never an indication that a character might actually be listening. The conflict was forced and the plot loosely strung together, there was a lot of filler content than actual story. Even Robert Downing Jr. himself, said that this movie turned out not-so-good (paraphrased) mainly because Marvel had way too much control over it and deleted so many scenes which would've done much to. It seemed too bland to me personally, just pointless action, plot holes and dumb plot elements. In the end, this movie is way better than Iron Man 3, and not as good as Iron Man.","

"tbone82094","27 April 2010","This sequel is definitely up on par with The Dark Knight in my book. The story and acting is so believable that it seems as if they are the characters and the graphics are definitely upgraded from the original film!!! Then the armors and weapons all look as if Iron Man and War Machine could be reality. Now don't get me wrong there is a good amount of dialog in this film but it does the film and characters justice. So you'll really understand where the characters come from. Even though I thought Terrence Howard was great as Rhodey, Don Cheadle was just as good like I predicted. Mickey Rourke really shined in this role as he did in Sin City and The Wrestler, his presence gave the me the same reaction as Heathe Ledger did with The Joker just speechless. Bottom line is that if you loved the first Iron Man and are a fan of the actors and director, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL!!!!!","

"JAM-31","15 May 2010","Okay, I am not a big comic book fan, nor do I know too much about ""Iron Man."" I am a big-time movie fan though, and there are certain things that a comic book movie (and basically ANY movie) needs to be successful.And they are: THRILLS... EXCITEMENT... SUSPENSE... STORY... ""Iron Man 2"" has none of them. How does a movie like this get released without them? ""Iron Man 2"" has no exciting plot for the hero to overcome to stop drastic consequences. No exciting action sequences to keep us on the edge of our seats. I don't know or really care how much this film keeps to the comic it was based on--if it doesn't have an involving, exciting story, it fails.All of the actors, Downey, Johannsen, Favreau, Rourke, Cheadle, give mediocre, forgettable performances. All of them are good actors who I have enjoyed watching in other films, but seem to just be trying to be cool, hip, and clever in front of the camera this time.This film should have reminded me of the ""Batman,"" ""Superman,"" or ""Spiderman,"" films, but it has more in common with the ""Ocean's 11"" movies: a bunch of big stars hamming it up, trying to be ""cool,"" and having fun in front of the camera, instead of trying to make a good movie.What does Mickey Rourke's villain want in this film? How will it affect the world if he achieves his aims? Why should we care if he succeeds? Why are there no moments when Iron Man seems on the verge of losing everything? This film is an example of letting success go to the producers' and actors' heads. Hopefully the fan-boys will realize and admit it stinks before more action and comic book films turn out as dull as this one.Grade: D","

"fernandoschiavi","5 October 2016","Comes to movie screens the long-awaited sequel to one of the best superhero movies of all time. Although not present more innovations and have that freshness in the air of novelty, the superhero continues to surprise further intensifying the relations of his characters amid good action scenes.Unfortunately the major flaw this sequence is that it does not innovate in relation to the first, just repeats the formula of the original, with the effects and technical finesse are even better. Robert Downey Jr. once again dominates the screen with Tony Stark supporting and appear well. It is interesting to show the threats suffered by Stark in this sequence: problems with disease caused by the use of armor superhero, the conflict against the U.S. government, without talking in very grotesque villain played by Mickey Rourke on the big screen.The screenwriter Justin Theroux to have performed the comedy ""Tropic Thunder"", entered many catch phrases and dialogues with much humor, sarcasm favoring even more especially applied to Stark. It's great the way Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux concatenate the connections between the characters and their pasts. The two new villains, Vanko and Hammer are totally anti-Tony Starks, forged from the same cast of heroes, in the best tradition of Marvel Comics. The action scenes are good but very ""lying"", but not something that you take the merit of the film. Favreau's direction is more focused on the characters than on action. The exaggerated scenes are few, and some deserve comment. The scene at the track racing in Monaco that appears Whip Black are spectacular and shows that he can actually be the one to represent a threat.We highlight the struggle of Black Widow with security that is graphically amazing and exciting - a shame that beyond this fight scene no more scenes in which the character appeared most prominently, but the Black Widow presented is cold and calculating, causing identifying who already know the character, not to mention physically and red hair characterization also does an excellent job. Also during the final scenes, the fight between Iron Man and War Machine against the Black Whip could be much better utilized. Until now we have to understand the reason for the fight have little time with the villain being eliminated very quickly. There was to be an epic moment of the film sensational confrontation and fell well short and disappoint.Robert Downey Jr. is clearly more comfortable in the skin of Stark again and steals the scenes in which is all the time. Again the comedic talent and wit of the actor and his obvious charisma deliver a character that was supposed to be annoying, arrogant and endowed with self-destructive behavior, one of the most beloved characters of today.The chemistry between Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell is great, resulting in truly funny moments. Even with Rourke's character having an essentially dramatic motivation, it becomes not only grim, making the balance between evil villain and intimidating with the spirit sarcastic and not afraid of their opponents, a wise decision on building character. The Black Whip interpreted by him is a mix of villains Crimson Dynamo and Whiplash own, which had some identities and the first was Ivan's father, Anton Vanko, who appears at the beginning of the film dying in his son's arms. Then came the specialty in electricity control. In the film, Whip Black / Whiplash has the name and nationality of Crimson Dynamo in the comics. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodes with competence. In the female cast, Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson does not have the screen time they deserve, but still has good scenes.The soundtrack of John Debney, who had worked with Jon Favreau on Zathura and who also signed the soundtrack plots as Sin City , dreamy and Hannah Montana - The Movie, is another high point and makes us vibrate in moments of action. The music track once again show the touch of rocker adventures and we can enjoy for example, ""Shoot to Thrill"" and ""Highway to Hell"", both AC / DC, among others.The references to the movie ""The Avengers"" are also a bit more punch with appearances by Nick Fury, who makes this is an important step towards the future Avengers movie - the reappearance of Agent Coulson and the connection made especially with the film Thor is quoting the phrase you're going to New Mexico to investigate something and culminates in the post-credit scene of the film. Undoubtedly for fans of Marvel scenes are a great appetizer for what lies ahead.   Compared to the first film, we can not say that this does not have its merits, but it lacked something. Maybe he missed a story more elaborate, with more conflict and action scenes better distributed and best enjoyed over two hours. Technical requirement in the movie is perfect and knew Jon Favreau once again lead the story well, even gaining more prominence as an actor with his character in this film gaining more space in a good sequence in which he is the Black Widow. Another factor is the pace that has more ups and downs than the previous adventure, improving over the last forty minutes from long. It is undeniable that the film is pure fun of the highest quality. Iron Man certainly not rusted and still has much to be tapped in future sequences! Bring on Iron Man 3 and hopefully Shane Black has the same responsibility toward that Favreau had these first two episodes of the franchise.","

"Jerique","12 May 2010","What can I say? Jon Favreau can never disappoint. Whether he's funny as an actor or artistic as a director. He's a master of his craft and definitely found his niche. He's an amazing director, with an uncanny ability to cameo in his own movies as a great comic relief.Robert Downey Jr., is an actor I've been watching for years. From being sweet and hilarious in Heart and Souls, to sarcastic and witty with an edge of drama in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang to perfecting his ability in playing Tony Stark. Robert is versatile and can go beyond some of the other great actors.Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect female to play Pepper Potts, as seen in the first film. She's funny, she's brainy, and she's sexy. She's got a beautiful face to look at and a sweet voice to hear. Her character, Pepper, takes a backseat for screen time to make room for others, but she still plays a prominent role in Iron Man's future.Samuel L. Jackson, gets a small cameo and Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as a really sexy, seductive, ass-kicking seductress who bounds to keep both Tony Stark and audiences on their toes. Don Cheadle comes along as well to play sidekick and Mickey Rourke is chilling and terrifying as villain Ivan Vanko.There's mind blowing special effects, triple the intense action sequences and give just the perfect amount of comic relief and you've got a sequel that does ten times better than the original. It's not surprising. Iron Man, wasn't bad by any means, but it just feels inferior to this. I can't imagine how it will seem when the third chapter is unveiled.Strap yourself in for a roller coaster ride of a lifetime. It's fun, it's dark, it's full of surprise and it's action packed. It's a great film for everyone. Grab grandma, grab your friends and let's go see Iron Man 2!","

"tripxyde","30 April 2010","I thoroughly enjoyed IRON MAN 2. But there are some very minor stuff that sort of bothered me. First off, I did like the character played by Mickey Rourke, which is Ivan Vanko (which seems to be a combination of the comic book characters Whiplash & Crimson Dynamo). But I felt that the details of the character were too underdeveloped. We got to see his some of his quirks and a little bit of back story which we thought was going to be spotlighted later on in the movie. Only to realize that the back story which felt like a teaser was not fully satisfied in the end anyway, and we walk off the movie not really having a full grasp what his character was all about. If the story wanted him to be a mysterious ""force of nature"" villain, the film should not have heavily teased on a back story in the first place, and should have gone with the fully mysterious psycho all the way. Basically his character was out to have vengeance on Stark, accusing his family of stealing an idea his (Vanko's) father pioneered. But in the end, it really was not clear what that ""stealing of idea"" was all about, or how Vanko's father was allegedly betrayed by the Stark family.You cannot dismiss the movie as just a superhero movie because like any good superhero movie, the story focuses on the story's characters rather than on just the superhero. The film does not solely rely on action, but much on humor. There were moments in the middle of the movie that made me forget I was watching a superhero movie, or an action movie. Much of the movie centers its focus on Tony Stark's relationship with his friend Rhodes, his assistant Pepper Potts, and his rival Justin Hammer. The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow is very sparklingly attractive and fun to watch.Don Cheadle was fine as Rhodes, Tony Stark's friend. But the fact that he is not physically consistent with Terence Howard, the actor he replaced for the role, messes up what should have been a fluid consistency with the previous Iron Man movie. In the end you forget about it (and he is, in comparison, as good as a replacement as Maggie Gyllenhal was in replacing Katie Holmes in the Dark Knight movie).Robert Downey Jr. is magnificent in his role. His Tony Stark is like the new role model; girls throw themselves at him & guys wanna be like him. His humor is always on the spot and his charms are flawless. His screen presence and how he makes a scene come alive is the major battery that makes this an enjoyable film.And then there's Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury. Which reminds me of the other nitpick detail that hated about the movie, and that is Nick Fury's first appearance in the movie. For a character which is supposed to have some degree of importance, his first scene looked like it lacked impact. Fury, appearing and having a conversation with Stark, in morning daylight, while wearing that shiny coat, made him look like a joke. And then we see the first costume appearance of Black Widow in the same scene, which also made her appearance have no impact at all. In fact, it was a scene that awkwardly made Nick Fury and Black Widow look silly and indeed looked like two people wearing costumes for some Halloween party. Even though the first line of Fury was indeed very funny, I still stand by the opinion that it was one scene that was just poorly conceptualized.Comedian Garry Shandling also appears in the movie, and although his role is not a major one, I consider him to be a highlight of the movie. He plays a Senator who is very skeptical and critical of Tony Stark and seems to have a shady background. His role was deadpan serious and almost villainous that he instantly feels like an un-ignorable beloved ""other villain"". From the moment he appears you can tell that he's supposed to be a big A-hole, and he does a great job with it.Jon Favreau who is both a great actor, comedian, and is also the director of the movie did a great job in making this sequel spectacular and continuously fun to watch. Despite its flaws, the movie was very enjoyable. It was well-paced, and designed never to bore its audience. The dialogues are very witty. And its performers do a marvelous job with their lines. It also had interesting non-cliché comedy gold moments. One of the funniest scenes that I enjoyed involve Robert Downey Jr. and one of those office decorations (you will know by the time you watch the movie). Although I felt that there would have been many interesting stunts or refreshingly new action tricks that can be made with the new villains (especially one with a super-powered whip), I cannot disregard the fact that the film invested more on the storyline aspect so to not make this movie just a mere ""dumb action flick"" that wants to appeal to all audience demographics.All in all, IRON MAN 2 is a High Matinée movie. Although greatly flawed, these flaws are only noticeable from a critical point of view. Even I came out of it with a full-bar fun movie experience, and only realizing its flaws hours later. If you love a movie with witty characters and some cool heavy metal robot action, then this movie is definitely for you. And let me remind you that there is an additional scene after the end credits, so if you don't wanna miss it then you might wanna stay awhile for it.","

"thinker1691","2 October 2010","From the incredible, innovative and often futurist mind of comic book artist, Stand Lee, comes this sequel to his hero. The Film is called "" Iron Man II. "" Director Jon Theroux, follows the basic character Iron Man, and challenges him with several new problems at once. First the alter ego of the Iron Man, Mr. Tony Stark, (Robert Downey) learns, the atomic power pack in his chest is not only saving his life, but is killing him at the same time. Secondly, his best friend, Lt. Col James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is covering for his friend but is also trying to secure one of the top secret iron man suits for the military and with the help of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) may well succeed. Lastly, there is the main frame heavy, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke, excellent acting), who vows to destroy Stark for betraying his father. Samuel L. Jackson, John Slattery, Garry Shandling and even Stan Lee all make cameo roles. The film is action packed, exciting, and promotes audiences to expect more in the following sequel. If that isn't enough, there is Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow who provide eye-candy with a attitude and a powerful executive allure for Stark. The movie is a worthy addition to the original and if you over-look a few minor flaws, such as none of the military figures, nor the police or the security guards are female, then the movie is well done and audiences look forward to the next. ****","

"d_art","19 May 2010","In Iron Man 2, Robert Downey Jr. returns as billionaire Tony Stark, this time facing pressures from the government to share his armor technology with the military. At the same time, he discovers the technology which keeps him alive is also slowly killing him. He appoints Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of Stark Industries, while her old job goes to Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson). Meanwhile, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the son of his father's enemy, joins forces with Stark's rival competitor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell).First off, I enjoyed the first Iron Man, but I wasn't a huge fan. I felt Jon Favreau's direction and Robert Downey Jr. made the film better than what it could've been. Tony Stark was fun, story was okay, and the villain was a bit disappointing. The idea of the villain being just another version of the protagonist never appealed to me. I felt the same way about the wannabe-Hulk villain in Incredible Hulk. Now, if the villain is very different from the hero (Joker vs. Batman / Superman vs. Lex Luthor / Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock), the hero has to apply different strategies, which makes for more entertaining battles. Well, in the Iron Man sequel, that idea hasn't changed too much—Iron Man still battles a similar foe, although there are now more of them. Thankfully, the shootouts, the flights, the computerized special effects, and the mass destruction are a lot of fun to watch, but it is not the central focus.This film's focus is all about the characters, an unusual direction for a sequel. It's no Transformers 2, that's for sure. Majority of the time, you won't see Tony Stark in armor. You do, however, get to see a bit of a darker and a vulnerable side to Tony, which happens to make him more complex, engaging, and sometimes, dangerous. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony flawlessly, and he's just as much fun, if not more, than before. Some may be put off by the dialogue-driven first half of the film. The film isn't all about ""let's hurry up and get him to fight somebody."" In fact, it takes its time, and there's not a whole lot of action in the beginning, but there's a certain build-up that leads to the eventual confrontation with the baddies. The film isn't so much about a specific villain or a goal, but it is mainly about Tony, his psychology, and his reactions to life. Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts—she is as we remember her from the last film—charming and continuously getting Stark out of trouble.Many interesting side characters make an appearance this time around. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) plays more of a prominent role as the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. Scarlett Johansson has great screen presence as Natalie Rushman (aka. Black Widow)—she holds herself pretty well in a great martial arts scene. Don Cheadle has replaced Terrance Howard as Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" and gets to play a more prominent role as an Iron Man suit-armored partner to Tony. This film, unlike the first film, tends to lean towards the idea of teamwork more. (Perhaps they're just prepping us for an Avenger film?) Mickie Rourke is engaging on screen as the Russian physicist villain Ivan, which he plays with dark relish. Although his technology—glowing, electrically charged whips—isn't anything new, he is always fun to watch. Likewise, Sam Rockwell is great as usual as a villain, the wisecracking Justin Hammer.The plot simply continues on from the last film, after people have found out the true identity of Iron Man. While it's nothing too complex, the progression of the story is logical--it would surely bring some enemies out of the woodwork if they knew who he was. The film's pacing isn't as zippy as the first film, where something always seems to be happening, and some audiences may be disappointed as a result.Overall, I found Iron Man 2 to be entertaining and a worthy sequel, and just different enough not to feel tacked on like an add-on to the previous film. Many sequels can get lazy—they just throw in everything and make it bigger and louder. Some sequels simply let the story progress. This is that kind of sequel. I give Iron Man 2 *** out of **** stars.You can also follow my reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art","

"hte-trasme","7 May 2010","I caught this movie with friends and in doing so became probably one of only a very few people to see it without having watched the first ""Iron Man"" movie. Knowing the basic premise behind the original comic book, though, I found that ""Iron Man 2"" holds up very well entirely on its own, and as a piece of entertainment is a thorough success with nary a dull moment. Like any good action movie, I think, ""Iron Man 2"" realizes it can't consist entirely of action, and this one at times feels just as much like a comedy or political thriller as it does a superhero-based special effects spectacular. That comedy is rooted in and succeeds because of really good character work, particularly with the lead Tony Stark. The script by Justin Theroux (who is, I found to my pleasure, related to the other writers Paul, Louis, Marcel, and Alexander Theroux) shows a facility with pointed, revealing dialogue and a whole lot of wit. This script also seems preoccupied with getting characters to declare -- if not in so many words ""Oh, yeah? Well just try and make me!"" which is deeply satisfying to empathize with even if it does eventually become a little repetitive as a theme. Robert Downey Jr gives another simply brilliant performance, and his character seems fully alive as a self-absorbed, witty, arrogant, and super-intelligent jerk of a superhero who knows his own life is about to end. This character is as much of a reason to watch the movie as anything. There is no attempt to hide the fact that much of the plot and its developments are based on pure technobabble -- a new element is discovered with suspicious ease, computer systems can be commandeered with only a few taps, &c. -- but these are not terribly insulting when left out in the open, and they do not interfere with the political caste that keeps the action story moving. Towards the end things become a little less thoughtful and it becomes harder to invest without a grounding in how the rules work for the new technologies that have been introduced, but it never descends to dullness. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson do well in their roles but those roles, while significant, are never explained or fleshed out much, and they sometimes seem to be there largely to look impressive each in their own way. Gwyneth Paltrow extends the cast of all-stars with a good performance as Pepper Pots, though she seems a little stuck on the note of ""beleaguered."" It's a nice surprise to see Garry Shandling show up as a fun comic-relief senator. This was great entertainment and well ahead of a standard issue genre action or superhero adaptation picture, served effective and real wit, good dramatic sub-plotting, and an extremely memorable lead performance from Downey that does a huge amount to make some scenes that would otherwise be laughably absurd very believable.","

"SloberDon","4 June 2010","WOW! The director has crafted a super sequel that both dazzles the eyes and touches the heart. Much like Spider-Man 2, the truly remarkable special-effects of the new movie make it virtually impossible not to suspend one's disbelief. The effects actually beat Spider-Man 2. A lesser filmmaker would have been content to let the effects be the whole show, but Favreau gives us a movie populated by genuine characters and situations that make the film just as compelling in its quieter moments as it is during the big action scenes. IM2 combines the thrills of a big summer romp with the craftsmanship of a prestige studio picture. It's not simple popcorn fun although it certainly works in that capacity but it's as complex as its conflicted protagonist. It's a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor that's well-acted and masterful at every turn. That's the kind of movie that I love to see one that isn't just dark to be dark or isn't just self-indulgent or overly serious for the sake of having some sort of false sense of gravitas. These Iron Man films are sweeping and even epic but, at the same time, they're tremendous popcorn entertainment. How many films can you say that about? Truly Superb.","

"Anuradha108","4 May 2010","I've watched IM2 twice so far, and am eagerly looking forward to the 3rd this Wed with a special friend. I'm also planning a possible trip to London to see it in Imax in the near future when I save enough money.I'm sharing some radom thoughts about IM2:What holds the story is a more in depth exploration of Tony and his relationship with his father, Pepper Potts and Rhodey. The spirit of the movie is fun and the subject matter is interestingly human and the actions are a blast. Robert Downey Jr is again breath-taking as Tony Stark. The romance between Tony and Pepper is a breath of fresh air and very endearing.The visual effect is spectacular, especially when Tony is making a breakthrough in his lab – it's like he's one with the whole universe! I enjoy Black Widow single-handedly handling all the security guards at Hammer industry with crisp karate moves mixed with high tech devices. However, I find it hard to relate to her emotionally as she's often expressionless and humourless. She's like a highly intelligent and sexy robot, or alien – effective, but lack of more fleshed-out human dimensions.I like Don Cheadle in the War Machine suit, but not when he's out of it. I feel he lacked the upright posture as a Lt. Col. His body language does not fully embody the spirit of James Rhodes.In my first viewing, I think Tony's out of his mind, down right miserable and ridiculous, and frankly I missed his boyish good look, and resented his sickly haggard look. But the movie took me to another place, and suddenly I can relate to what it's like for a genius billionaire to face premature mortality and have no one to share his fear and regret, not even his love interest or best friend. I can relate to the desperate sense of isolation, powerlessness in reaching out for help, helplessness in simply getting some understanding from the one he cares most, and the need to escape into a donut.I like the more in depth exploration of Tony's relationship with his father, Howard Stark through the contrast of his nemesis, Ivan and his father Anton. Even though Tony's born with the privilege, wealth, and talent, he grew up feeling unloved by a cold, distant father and then orphaned at a young age. Ivan, on the other hand, grew up in poverty, lack of recognition and imprisonment, but shared a deep love with his father.I think Ivan Vanko is a well-developed character, and Micky Rourke very much nailed it. He has a strong and intimidating screen presence yet can still connect with the audience through deep emotions and humour.I love it when Tony finally discovers his father's love for him in an old tape in which his father told him that Tony was his greatest creation. For me, that's the equivalent to the ""Proof that Tony Stark has a heart"" Pepper gives Tony in IM.It's interesting that Robert further explored the father issue in his next movie, Due Date.","

"faisal_khatib","1 May 2010","I hadn't seen the original Iron Man movie in the theater and so I blamed that to not liking it i.e. the big screen awe effect of having a super hero bash different villains was missing. So when I heard about the sequel, decided to watch it in the theater. Till yesterday morning, I thought it was a 3D movie but on checking the local cinema website I realized it wasn't. I think not having it in 3D was a huge mistake cause even though 3D is over rated, I'd think a movie like this would have gained a lot from it.I was a little excited after seeing everyone else looking forward to be amazed by Tony Stark aka Iron Man but 2 hours later and the only word that came to my head was rubbish. That's how bad I thought the movie was even though everyone else seemed to like it in bits.The problem is when I think about comic book movies, I have this high expectation because a comic book has so much material to build on so I assume the movie will be amazing and apart from a few, most of them are disappointing. I'm not a huge comic book person but I know a bit about them to know how bad these films always end up being. I suppose it's similar to the problem that the Harry potter movie series faces.Now talking about Iron Man 2. The story revolves around Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.), the rich multi millionaire play boy super hero who has privatized world peace. How the government is trying to get their hands on the technology/weapon that is Iron Man while trying to replicate it with the help of Hammer industries run by Justin Hammer (played by Sam Rockwell). This time we also had a side kick in the form of Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (played this time by Don Cheadle) who was the other Iron Man (?). Then we have Ivan Vanko (played by Mickey Rourke) who manages beat Iron Man up in their first clash with his garage built whip thing called whiplash and then gets hired by Hammer industries and creates a droid army and a new suit for himself. Wish they'd given him more of a role apart from talking Russian and sarcastic smiles/giggle.The ladies in the film were Pepper Potts (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff (played by Scarlett Johansson). Pepper Potts is Tony Starks secretary/love interest/better half etc  whatever you want to call it. Gwyneth Paltrow sleep walked through her tiny role which wasn't a bad thing while Scarlett Johansson was the eye candy(?) of the film to make the hyper guys happy. Tight clothes, skin show, kicking ass (literally) kind of summarized her predictable cliché role.Finally we had the one eyed Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who tries to knock some sense into Tony Stark who goes off the hook in the middle of the movie. I wonder why Samuel L. Jackson agreed to do such an effortless role. Maybe it has something to do with the movie The Avengers.Few things that annoyed me... - If Ivan manages to beat up Iron Man so easily in his poorly funded garage project, I'd assume killing Ivan later on when he's got a whole new armor (with the backing of Hammer industries) would be quite a work out for Iron man and his sidekick butthe final show down between them was short and just too easy. - Don't call the creation of a new element an almost impossible procedure and then make Tony Stark create it without any hassles. - Yes we know what USA thinks about Iran, Pakistan, North Korea etc. You don't need to keep reminding us that through movies as well. - Yes Tony Stark is a playboy but do you really need to stuff that fact into our face every single time. - Justin Hammer was annoying...enough said. - Villains are important, give them more to say. - Do you really need a character in the movie for guys to ogle over.I'm sure there were more points but I just can't break my head over it. Honestly, Robert Downey Jr. did a good job playing TonyStark/Iron Man but the movie was just too boring, lame, predictable, cliché etc that his decent act couldn't save it for me. Overall I'm glad I just paid AED15 for the movie...it wasn't worth anything more than that.","

"HrutkaPal","5 May 2010","This movie was absolutely terrible. Seriously, everyone involved(except Rourke) should be ashamed. I don't know what was the worst thing: -Starks annoying love for himself, which was good in part 1, but here it was over the top. -The even more annoying Paltrow character, which just wouldn't shut up for one second -The fact, that the movie had a ridicilously flat story, which is close to not existing -Or all those wannabe side-characters which had almost no role at all, and were just in to provide some big names to the castAfter like 20 minutes it was pretty obvious for me, that this movie is gonna suck. But I thought, hey, maybe the actions scenes could spice things up a bit. But not even those were really entertaining. The ONLY part, where I thought that it might become interesting, was where all those robots showed up, and they were outnumbered. Cool. What happened? They killed them in like 30 seconds. What a joke.Rourke's character was the only thing that was a plus.","

"AngelHonesty","8 August 2023","The first movie stands in your mind, its something you walk away with remembering, because its a great movie. And Iron man is awesome. Everytime I watch Iron man part two, I'm like, what was it about again? It's not a bad movie, but its not a great one either.This was the first film that the Black Widow is introduced. She's one of my favorite characters from the avengers. I love how they put her in the movie, its very subtle and yet she stands out at the same time. Its great that we have the original cast back, except Terrence Howard as James Rhodes. He was replaced with Don Cheadle. I normally like Cheadle but after seeing the way Terrence Howard played the role, I did like Cheadle as James Rhodes. He came off cold and didn't have the same chemistry that Terrence had. It felt like they were strangers instead of best friends. The action was great, and I really liked Whiplash. He was down right cool with the whips. But the character of Justin Hammer played by Sam Rockwell didn't fit right for me. It almost would have been better if he wasn't even apart of the story or if his character was written different. The movie felt lacking in action and the last final fight could have been longer or spread out more. And they did not show enough of Pepper Potts and Howard Stark. I honestly find their relationship a little confusing in the movie. Are they still friends? Are they more than that? It felt like the scenes with them were randomly thrown in instead of carefully crafted. The script for Pepper was very different then the first movie, she almost seemed like a different person. I think the biggest downfall to the movie is the over simplified plot. And the clunky connection between the cast. Its missing heart.","

While it is not as amazing as the first one it is a worthy successor and Marvel/Disney managed to get everyone on board for any subsequent MCU movie. The only downside is the lackluster antagonist, which is a shame considering I really like Mickey Rourke.","

Each cast members proved their worthy and the script is one of the best.With perfect balancing of action and humour accompanied by mind-blowing VFX and star studded cast, resulted in one of the greatest films that ever made.Recasting James Rhodes / War Machine with Don Cheadle is a great choice and Terrence Howard never fitted for that part.With a charismatic performance from Robert Downey Jr. (as always), the main GOAT in this film is none other than, Sam Rockwell. His fantastic performance in almost every scene lift this film to it's glory.","

"Zac_La_Porte","3 September 2022","This sci-fi action sequel with big effects, armour and weaponry is worth the time and money of someone who absolutely loved the first Iron Man movie, but this movie doesn't have any brighter or better ideas than the first. There's lots of things in this movie that are top-notch, including the occasional amount of humour, the action, villains, heroes and thematic ideas throughout. But just don't expect it to beat the first film, which was very enjoyable.Iron Man 2 succeeds in some of the most important things that superhero action and sci-fi movies truly need, beginning in a very promising an entertaining first act that settles us into the plot, which is Tony Stark facing pressure by the government to share his weapons with the world while battling a new enemy, Whiplash, played by Mickey Rourke. The antagonist of the film is honestly very good, with his motive being extremely appealing as he is trying to defeat Iron Man to prove that the hero's armour and weapons can be destroyed.The action sequences, especially the prolonged one during the last act, are very well-done, with multiple special effects and stylish moves portrayed by characters. Most people who don't enjoy the Marvel movies or sci-fi superhero action flicks will find that this movie simply isn't their taste when it comes to the genre, which some will have adored the first Iron Man. Unfortunately for some, this sequel is messy and boring, with unnecessary moments and the pacing becoming flat before the climax.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"liggins14","10 May 2010","I really don't understand what people were expecting, looking at some of the negative reviews. This sequel gives you everything that was great about the first film and then some. Better action, more humor, more characters, and more Easter eggs leading into the Avengers movie. It delves further into Tony Stark's character, showing that his arrogant public persona is a ruse...behind the scenes, he's scared to death because the artificial heart he created is slowly poisoning him to death. He begins drinking heavily, which is leading up to a ""Demon in a Bottle"" sequel; comic book fans know that I'm talking about a key Iron Man story line that helped define the character. I loved Scarlett Johansen as the Black Widow...her one action scene was awesome. The two major Iron Man/War Machine fight scenes beat the action sequences in the first film. The final scene was much better the first movie's finale. I can't wait to see Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers movies!","

"barrys82","24 July 2010","Iron Man 2 left me a very pleasant taste. Maybe it doesn't have the same amount of action than the first one but it is compensated with better CGI, a better developed plot and a more interesting story. Billionaire Tony Stark must contend with deadly issues involving the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies due to his superhero alter ego Iron Man. As I say before, this sequel isn't full of action like the first one but in my opinion it has enough to leave you satisfied and entertained. It also has good moments of humor specially from Robert Downey Jr. The cast is excellent, and practically the same of the first one with the addition of Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Black Widow and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vankov/Whiplash and the substitution of Terence Howard with Don Cheadle as Rhodey, in fact I think that with Cheadle the movie gains in acting . Downey is again perfect as Tony Stark/Iron Man, it is a role made for him. Gwyneth Paltrow is good enough as Pepper Potts and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Nick Fury. In conclusion, Iron Man isn't as exciting as the first one but it has everything to be a total summer blockbuster and pleased the viewer. Oh and one more thing be sure to stay at the end of the final credits to watch a very good surprise.","

"bluesman-20","14 May 2010","Iron Man 2 starts off where the first one left off and hits the ground running from there. Tony Stark is a national icon Iron Man is seen by a grateful American public as a protector. The government sees the armour as a weapon of mass power that should not be in the hands of just one man. Then there is Justin Hammer a Business rival of Tony Stark's who is obsessed with creating his own Iron Man armour and mass producing it. the Trouble is this the tech used for Iron Man is so superior to anything out there that Stark figures it will take at least twenty years to create an armour like his. Tony is living large and hiding a tragic secret but on top of all of that comes Ivan Vanko or Whiplash armed with tech. Dangerously close to Starks Vanko wants revenge . plus there is betrayal spy work and of course the Black widow wonderfully played by Scarlett Johansson and the ever gruff super spy tough guy legend Nick Fury played by the one and only Sam.L.Jackson. The movie moves at a rocket pace and delivers the acting is solid the story is strong and the story ties up all the loose ends plus gives us more Iron Man and the introduction of War Machine Tony's best friend and fellow crime fighter. Mickey Rouke carries his part with cold sinister menace he and RDJ are the movie and you won't take your eyes off of them. Worth seeing ? YES!","

"SilverDiamond1987","10 May 2010","Iron Man 2 focuses on humor, rather than action or excitement and this causes the movie to be mild. Iron Man 2 is entertaining, but entertainment comes from humor most of the time. Therefore, Iron Man 2 is more like a Saturday show, a Saturday night entertainment than an exciting super hero movie which has a lot of action. Probably it is because the director, Jon Favreau is a director who made comedy movies like Elf or Zathura and the screen writer is the writer of Tropic Thunder, then much (sometimes too much) humor is inevitable. This is what Iron Man 2 has. In addition, the execution and the story were better in the first installment. However, there is a more interesting villain played by great Mickey Rourke (even if even this character is mostly passive throughout) The villain of the first movie was a businessman as known. There are some great visuals, War Machine played by Don Cheadle is included in the team, there are nice cameos like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson is really sexy. There are a few real wow moments and most of them are in The Grand Prix scene. It was the best scene of the movie to me. It could have been longer, but it is definitely satisfying. However, till the final part, you have to wait, if you want to see action. Probably, directors have started to believe that in an action movie, if there is less action, but more drama, the movie becomes more deep and more serious. Some people call this as Spider-Man 3 syndrome. Iron Man 2 suffers from this syndrome at times, in the middle part of the movie. It makes us feel like we watch a comedy drama and this is not surprising, because as I mentioned, the director of the movie is Jon Favreau who made comedy movies, played in comedy movies and the script writer of the movie is Justin Theroux who wrote a comedy before, Tropic Thunder. As for the characters, Robert Downey Junior is again the star of the movie, but he was more funny, cool and witty in the first movie. Natasha Romanoff played by Scarlett Johannson is passive most of the time, the operation scene was entertaining, but it is sad that this character consists of a few showy acts. Ivan Vanko (Rourke) is not a wasted character like Natasha Romanoff, but mostly he sits down and masterminds the chaos. Then, he is included in a disappointing and too short final fight (a few minutes) It starts and finishes in a trice. There are three action parts in the movie. The first one is The Grand Prix scene, in the second one, Iron Man and War Machine are included in a chaos (pretty long) and the third one is the final fight. As a result, Iron Man is very humorous at times, entertaining at times, otherwise disappointing.","

"agmoldham","25 September 2010","The first Iron Man film was a pleasant surprise. The second instalment therefore carried higher expectations. Although not a disaster the second film doesn't quite live up to the first film.The story revolves around the government wanting to have the technology of the Iron Man from Tony Stark. Stark is holding onto the information and says nobody will be able to mimic this for many years. There's no surprises to find that this doesn't turn out to be true.Downey Jr is again pretty entertaining as Stark and Mickey Rourke is also pretty good as Ivan Vanko. It sounds like Johansson and Paltrow didn't get on that well, but there's not too much evidence of that on screen which is slightly disappointing.","

"Chiron1987","10 June 2010","There are two saving graces in ""Iron Man 2."" The first is Gwyneth Paltrow's wondrous performance as Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts. Paltrow is literally stunning as Pepper and brings a warmth and depth to this character in a beautiful way.The second is the ""Easter egg"" scene after the end credits in which we see S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Coulson discover the mighty Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, in a crater in New Mexico.That's pretty much it.""Iron Man 2"" is boring, trite, and does nothing for the character or this franchise in any meaningful way. Even the battle scenes were not entertaining. Whereas ""Iron Man"" was fun and exciting and interesting, ""2"" is the exact opposite and even borders on ""Batman & Robin"" embarrassing at times, which is pretty terrible.I had low expectations for ""Iron Man 2"" whenever I saw the first trailer for the film, and it's safe to say that it exceeded (or whatever the opposite of ""exceed"" is) them in spades.I can only hope that the ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" and ""The Avengers"" films are better. And a word of advice to the filmmakers, reign in Robert Downey, Jr. a little bit next time. Just say what's in the script, Robert...we didn't come to the theater to see a Second City improv performance.","

"son_of_cheese_messiah","4 May 2010","The old saying too many cooks spoil the broth springs to mind. Here there are too many plot elements and redundant characters. Mickey Rourke looks impressive but, like everything else here, is wasted in a film which tries to cram too much in. Whiplash, Black Widow, Nick Fury, Justin Hammer, War Machine are all quickly introduced and then scantly used. The first fight at the race track between Whiplash and Stark is the highlight but could have been so much better. For instance, we see Pepper Potts driving to deliver Iron Man's armour to him in the opposite direction to the race cars. This could have been an exhilarating scene worth of The French Connection, but not much is made of it. It is not well explained what Whiplash has against Stark. Then comes Hammer, a dull corporate villain very similar to the dull corporate villain in the first film. Why can't Hollywood get beyond these off the peg evil capitalists? A fight with another Iron Man. Some secret agents. Then more Iron men. A lot of gimmicky effects. Nothing we haven't seen many times before.","

"mohamed-auc","7 August 2010","I can't believe I actually paid money to watch this horrible thing!! The movie has nothing to see, no plot, no character development and no realism at all!! (SPOILERS) The movie is basically about a super awesome guy with a tin armor, who is a very wealthy, very sexy, very cool, can hack any computer in seconds, brought world peace with his ""tin"" armor. The story continues when you see that he is also a genius scientist who discovered or created a new element in about 15 minutes!!It gets better when you see the all bad a** guy/scientist also who drinks vodka all day and loves his parrot!! a scientist whose body is all covered by tattoos and looks like a thug.Bottom line, if you want to waste your time, at least waste it more decently, there are a lot of retarded movies way better and realistic than this one.

Now comes Iron man 2 two years later my expectations for this film was high and it lived up to them from the opening sequence to the end,one scene that I thought was great and emotional at the same was the party scene when Tony get's drunk and starts to terrorize his guest's I hated seeing Tony like although I must admit when Rhodes come's to fight him that's where things go from serious to funny,with a nice little mix from Dj Am,whose appearance was welcomed.Iron man 2 is not your typical superhero film instead it does something different.When we finally see Warmachine in all his glory he's bad ass,Ivan Vanko is an awesome villain his presence was great,the acting in the movie was top notch,and Robert does another great job.Jon Faveru does a great job at directing and I hope he returns for another one,and stay after the credits,I'm giving this movie a 10/10 it's a perfect way to kick off the summer.","

And, I invited my friend to come with me since he doesn't go to the movies often and now he is mad at me because he hated it also. Now, don't get me wrong, I am thoroughly an Iron Man fan and read the comic most of my young life. But I think the movie was a movie designed to further the franchise. The setup for the Avengers is now strongly in place as they spent a very large part of the movie harping the Avengers. It took almost two hours before we even get to see the suit do anything worth watching. They spent more time showcasing Scarlet fighting than they did with Iron Man. Robert Downey also proves that he just gets more irritating as he gets older. That and whoever said Jon Favreau and Gwynneth Paltrow are stars should be put on trial. The four main characters just do not go together and the fact that they took out the best performer from the first one - Terence, is quite sad. I like Don Cheadle as much as the next guy but he doesn't even come close to making Rhodes believable. This movie has taken a terrible step back and should not be seen by anyone.","

"rooee","5 May 2010","Watching Iron Man 2 is kind of like observing a largely bloodless car crash while someone provides amusing narration. The plot is a wheeling mess, but the film is rescued by a lively, screwball script and some sharp improvisation from an ensemble of talented performers. Least amongst them is Mickey Rourke as the vengeful Ivan Vanko, in a performance that belongs to a far darker movie. Indeed, his scenes highlight the film's frequent lurches from breezy to black, which, combined with an apparent explosion at the on-set minor character-making factory, create an experience far less satisfying than its simple-minded predecessor – which itself was an ideal response to the ""darkening"" of comic book adaptations brought about by the Nolan brothers.This sequel is best when it focuses on verbal sparring. Because, while Favreau is a competent director, he has people scenes and CGI scenes; he hasn't the skill of Jackson, Cameron or Spielberg at blending the human and the virtual. This leads, after some mecha gunplay straight out of Halo, to a disappointingly perfunctory final confrontation.After it's all over, one is left scratching one's head. What was the purpose of Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), besides laying multiple beds for multiple sequels? Why did Rhodes (Don Cheadle) overreact so dramatically at Stark's (Robert Downey Jr) birthday party? Was their ensuing bromantic tussle the sole trigger for Rhodes' subsequent robo-larceny? It all amounts to an overlong, overcomplicated, occasionally enjoyable disaster.","

"helmutty","1 May 2010","I can't say that this is better or worse than first one. One thing that Iron Man 2 is better than the first one is the action scenes. There are more robots to robots clashing in this one although they are a bit short and do not provide enough thrills. One thing Iron Man 2 does not have in the first one is the intensity of the story. This time, the story is not so fast, and in the middle, it drags. Jon the director tries to inject drama into this but in the end, it pulls the fast pace into a slower one. I am not saying it is bad but it just does not put justice to the first one which has a fun pace.The story: Like I said, this cannot be compared to the first, in fact. Since, Tony is back and he has bigger problems to deal including a villain. The first third of the movie is energetic including WhipSplash known as Ivan in a car racing scene. The second third of the movie is where the pace goes slower for Tony to deal with his personal problems and that gives time to Ivan to build robots. The last third is where Tony thankfully solves his major problem and prepares to suit up for the climax. It may not have the energy like the first one but it is still fun with new characters. John Debney,who replaces Ramin, creates an epic score for this one.Overall: It still entertains and has a lot of fun. I would say it is certainly a good sequel to the first while it is not comparable. This may be the only movie for your thirst of superheroes movies unless you count Jonah Hex in. This better makes good in box office to have a another sequel.","

"mahmus","18 August 2020","Perhaps it's because, unlike most MCU films, it feels like characters are just living in this universe. They're not driven by plot or action, they're just caught up in the obstacles that come with living in a world of superheroes, even if Marvel was clearly still trying to figure out what that world would be like.It's cool to see these characters just living their lives and dealing with their own personal problems while the villains deal with their own somewhere else. It makes for a somewhat uneventful story, but it sets it apart from other entries, both for better and worse.As I mentiones earlier, the MCU was still very undefined. The introduction of Nick Fury (as more than a cameo) and Black Widow isn't the first attempt to expand the world of the movie beyond its central hero (The Incredible Hulk had a Tony Stark cameo and the Super soilder serum played a big part in the plot), but it is the first time they had the main hero interact with this wider world, and while it's definitely not done as gracefuly as in later films, it does makes the universe feel lived in.Also, while I think that Scarlett Johansson is great as Black Widow (and that she's great here), she was definitely not as confident in the role as she would be in later films.Overall, it's a step down from the first one, but one that I still ejoy quite a lot.","

"SebaZava","1 May 2010","Put simply, Iron Man 2 is the best film I've seen so far this year. That doesn't mean no movie released this year can be better than Jon Favreau's masterpiece of a comic book film, but I certainly don't think any potential blockbuster this year will be as funny, exciting, well- developed and brilliantly acted. As hard as it may be to imagine, Iron Man 2 is even better than the original movie - and, you know, the first part was, along with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, one of the best comic book films ever made. It does almost nothing wrong, and while it isn't 100% brilliant all the way, it's as good as any ""traditional"" comic book adaptation can be. (The Dark Knight being a ""non-traditional"" adaptation.)The story is a little more convoluted than in the first movie, but fortunately director Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) don't make the same mistakes Sam Raimi made with Spider-Man 3. Sure, there is more than one villain, but the only ""active"" villain is Ivan Vanko; Justin Hummer is more of an instrument, and is not a classic villain in the sense that he is neither intimidating nor particularly dangerous. He only has the ""resources.""Those who have seen the first installment might have noticed that, while the movie was excellently-written and acted, it kind-of-suffered during its climax because of some weak action. Well, this certainly isn't the problem here, since Iron Man 2 provides with some of the best action you'll see this year. Unlike, you know, a film like Transformers 2, the machine-on- machine battles in Iron Man 2 are actually exciting and tense because we know there are people behind those suits; because those people have been well-developed throughout two movies, and because Favreau, unlike Michael Bay, doesn't feel the need to shake the camera as much as possible and cutting every millisecond while shooting an action sequence.Performances, much like in the previous film, are absolutely perfect. Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, there is no doubt about it, and even in the film's weakest scenes - which are very few -, Downey makes the movie work. This time around, Stark is dying - the substance that makes the suit work and keeps him alive is actually killing him - and Downey Jr. now portrays Stark not only as a charismatic playboy, but also as a somewhat deeper character, who resorts to alcoholism because of all his problems. This alcoholism is not the main point of the film, though - it certainly is addressed, but it's something that gets dismissed rather quickly. This is for the better, I believe - even more problems and another sub-plot would have only hurt the film, and I'm sure the filmmakers will be able to explore this characteristic of Tony Stark in a deeper manner in subsequent films.Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard from the previous movie, is effective as Jim Rhodes. (He's even got some great one-liners.) Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, and her relationship with Tony manages to move forward a little. There's great chemistry between the two of them, and they've got some great scenes together. Mickey Rourke is just great as Ivan Vanko - the majority of his dialogue is in Russian, and although he isn't precisely three- dimensional, we know just enough about the characters for him to remain both (a little) mysterious and intimidating. Sam Rockwell is also delightful as Justin Hammer - a very coward and unlikeable characters, that's for sure, but Rockwell manages not to turn him into a caricature. Scarlett Johansson, on the other hand, is just superb as agent Natasha Romanoff. With this part not only does she prove that she's the sexiest, most beautiful actress alive - one just has to hear men's reaction in the theatre whenever she appeared on- screen -, but also that she may be able to hand an entire action film by herself. She was just... *sigh*... amazing.So is the film perfect? Not really, but its faults are small enough for them not to hurt he overall quality of the picture. Still, while the John Debney's score wasn't particularly awful or bothersome, it simply was... mediocre. There's nothing memorable or outstanding about his music. It's just... there. Completely forgettable. On the other hand, while I certainly was excited about the presence of a couple of AC/DC songs (Shoot to Thrill and Highway to Hell), I expected more of them, at least three or four, not just two! I mean, there's a reason why the film's soundtrack is made up entirely of AC/DC songs right? (I already bought it, by the way, and it's a nice re-collection of classic songs.) For example, if you know AC/DC has a song called War Machine and one of the characters in your movie is called ""War Machine""... wouldn't it be logical for you to put that song in the film? Hopefully they're saving it for the next installment or something.Anyway, those faults aren't particularly big, and the film as a whole is just amazing. It had been some time since I last left the theatre so excited. I mean, I am studying film-making, and when I left the theatre after watching Iron Man 2 I just thought ""this is the kind of film I want to make."" And by that I don't mean a superhero movie necessarily... I mean a film that does so many things correctly: it's laugh-out-loud hilarious at times, but it's also incredibly exciting. It's got some amazing special effects, interesting and believable characters, great performances, a complex but effective plot and it even works as a set up for a bigger universe of superheroes. Once again, Iron Man 2 is the best film I've seen this year so far, and I just can't imagine any blockbuster being more successful. I'm definitely seeing it again a couple of times in theatres... yes, it's that good.","

"welhof1","17 November 2021","Nothing super new here but more action and they did a good job. The main villain was pretty cool. I liked his whips. Also the villain Hammer was annoying but I liked him. I watch these iron man movies for the suit and this sequel did not disappoint.I will say the romance between stark and Potts is a little awkward. That role just doesn't seem to be for her and she's not a great actress.","

"mredude411","8 May 2010","Before I went to see the movie, I looked online to see what people thought of it, and there was a lot of mixed reviews, so I didn't know what to think.At the end of the movie, I was very impressed by the movie. It added a lot to the first one, while still moving on with its' own story. It had a good mix between comedy, dialog, and action, though I think it could have taken a small bit from the dialog and add it to the other two parts.Something I have noticed about Iron Man 1 and 2 is that both movies were setting up something. During most of Iron Man 1, they were setting up the Iron Man story; they were giving Iron Man's back story. That makes sense, to explain where the hero came from. So when I went to see Iron Man 2, I expected it to jump right into things, but by the end of the movie, I realized it was setting up some more. (1st of two spoilers) At the end of the first movie, after the credits their was Nick Fury, from SHIELD, wanting to talk about the Avengers. Okay reference to the avengers, that is cool and all. Then when the second movie came, Nick Fury played a bigger part, and you slowly realize that Iron Man 2 is slowly setting it's way up to the Avengers movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie is not trying to drown us in Avengers references and scenes. There really are only two or three scenes talking about the Avengers, and a few clever references (a certain shield belonging to a certain super hero) and that is about it. The thing is that all of Tony Stark's progression as a character in this movie, is to guide him to being a part of the Avengers. (2nd of two spoilers) And the end of the second movie, after the credits, you see a guy from SHIELD in New Mexico, and they find ""something"" and you see Thor's hammer, which is going to be the next movie in the series.So though it is a good movie, and made my inner nerd freak when I saw Thor's hammer, I am starting to feel iffy about the Avengers Movie, whenever it comes out in a few years. They still need to do Thor, Captain America, and Ant Man, and then the Avengers. Will the last three movies just be set ups as well? And when we do finally reach the Avengers movie, will it be as amazing as all the sets up make it seem?That is a question that only time will answer. I still recommend seeing this movie, if you are a comic book fan, or even just an average movie fan.","

"Al_The_Strange","6 May 2015","In the first Iron Man film, we saw an arms manufacturer develop a conscience and become a hero trying to clean up the mess his company left behind. A follow-up was inevitable, and Iron Man 2 would continue to track Tony Stark's moral journey through even more highs and lows.Among the high points of the film, Iron Man confronts a new villain that pops up out of the blue, who trashes some race cars and sends them flying down the track. The film's climax pits Iron Man against a whole contingent of drones, before Iron Man and War Machine team up in an explosive all-out fighting sequence. All this action is really cool, but the film still dishes out plenty of amusing banter and interesting thematic material to keep everything even.Unfortunately, the film suffers a few low points. In spite of the dramatic issues the film tackles, the pacing is not always perfect; scenes in-between the action can be a hit-or-a-miss. This is because the film juggles a lot of different things in its plot. It is notable how the film continues to track Tony Stark's growth, for even though he embraced a new identity as a hero, he still has his ego to contend with, and it gets him into all kinds of trouble in this film. These scenes do dig up significant levels of conflict, and ultimately, it presents a compelling account of how Tony's obsession with technology and fame gradually erodes his soul and isolates him from the people around him. However, the film also tosses in other random elements - including a Russian bad guy who has no real relevance to the story's main conflicts, and some random scenes with Black Widow and Nick Fury that only serve to whet audiences' appetites for 2012's Avengers. In spite of these haphazard plot points, the film doesn't necessarily congeal well, making for a rather uneven story.Fortunately, the film looks good, with decent photography and editing. Robert Downey Jr. continues to excel as the main character, while Gweneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, and Samuel L. Jackson are all fun to watch. Mickey Rourke has some cheesy parts (especially with his ""I vant my boid"" line), but I think he's good most of the time. Writing is okay, but probably could have used more refinement. This production features good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. John Debney's music score is pretty awesome.Iron Man 2 is decently-entertaining and its story has a few significant points to make, but it is rather mixed, and it has led many viewers to regard it as an inferior sequel. Regardless of its issues, I find the film perfectly enjoyable.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Mixed | Film: Very Good)","

"kotrynamacca","16 May 2010","I gotta say, Robert Downey Jr. is the best actor I've ever seen! He beats out greats like Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt. He never ceases to impress and woo. Every movie he is in, he always steals the spotlight. Robert is perfect in any role he plays. He has got to be the most charismatic guy on the planet. AND the best looking! Yes, his handsomeness is on great display in this amazing film! Now, getting to Iron Man 2, it triples the magic of the first one! The script (and some hilarious obvious ad-libs by Robert Downey Jr.), the plot, the acting, the casting, the chemistry amongst the actors, the directing, the effects, the sets, the messages- PERFECT. PLUPERFECT.The comedy, the drama, the action, the themes, the FUN! My oh my, this movie was something a sequel never is- better than the first! First off, I LOVED the first Iron Man- absolutely adored the film. I had high expectations for Iron Man 2, but I thought it would be impossible to make the sequel any better than the fantastic start to a franchise was. But, I was wrong! Iron Man 2 is 10 times better than the first, if that's even possible! Honestly, I think everyone in the world should see this movie. I'm a big movie buff, and I say this only about the films I truly love. The plot was more complex this time with more subplots to add to the fantastic story. This is nothing like your regular superhero movie. This isn't Batman, Spiderman, or Superman. This is as realistic as it gets. This is something that could truly happen in real life, especially nowadays. It very much applies to modern times and modern problems. This is a very realistic man dealing with very realistic problems. By the way, Tony Stark wasn't that narcissistic at all, even though many people seem to say he was. RDJ portrayed him as truly likable with real emotion, charm, and on-the-dot comic timing. A real-world hero. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark will go down in history as one of the big screen's most memorable characters. This movie kept the audience laughing throughout with the superb witty dialogue and many intentionally hilarious scenes laced with intelligent humor. The movie had some truly emotional and serious scenes, courtesy of the great talent of Robert Downey Jr. It is art. It is pure charm on display for all to see. It is a gift. It is true talent and ability to sway the emotions of the viewers. Robert is my hero- in more ways than one. As a woman, I am so happy a man so ideal actually exists! Is he peerless? Quite possibly!The serious undertones of this action-packed intelligent comedy give the movie its edge. The fact that this movie very much applies to the real world is very appealing. The Avengers is next, but that will contain the unrealistic superheroes like Thor and Hulk, which belong with Spiderman and Superman...that won't be the same...the Iron Man franchise is the real superhero franchise- not a kids' make-believe one. Iron Man 1 and 2 have such great charm and that real-world quality that are not present in the Batman franchises, the Spiderman franchise, the Superman franchise, the Hulk movies, and all the other superhero films. Iron Man 2 is unmatched in its strength as true coolness and top-notch entertainment. It is so smartly written and performed that it makes me truly proud of Hollywood. Thanks to RDJ and Jon Favreau! I am more than pleased with Iron Man 2. I am beyond blown away. It's worth every penny to go and see it! I'm going to see it for a third time next weekend!This film is eye-candy, brain-candy, and heart-candy!","

"acedj","24 January 2020","Iron Man 2 takes a deep, dark look at the man behind Iron Man, specifically at his inner demons. We all have them, our specific regrets that make us who we are. Tony thinking his father was never fond of him nor wanted him around. The fact that alcohol becomes a crutch to lean on as he battles the fact that he might be dying, his undying love for a Ms. Pepper Potts. During a car race two new villains appear, one is obvious, Whiplash, one not so much, Justin Hammer. Unbeknownst to Tony some new friends also appear, one Black Widow and the ever present S.H.I.E.L.D. There is a lot going on in this movie, and it probably should have been longer or made into two films. Mickey Rourke was right in that his character was not fully developed, nor was just how ever pervasive Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. are. This is still a great movie. R.D.J. was born to play Tony Stark and that fact shines through. Also, this movie has the best line in all of the MCU, and was probably echoing the thoughts of every man watching the movie; when Tony first meets Natasha (calling herself Natalie here), as she is walking away says, ""I want one"". Yeah Tony we all do.","

"boothstr96","8 May 2010","The thing that is so hard to do in films is to make your content convincing. This is why so many other films fail. Favreau does not fail. I was worried going into Iron Man 2 that it wasn't going to live up to its hype and its prequel. But it did. The only criticism I have is that it is a bit slow for its type of movie. However, the content within the slower scenes is often filled with witty dialogue, low-key visual spectacles, and some confusing concepts. What I'm trying to get at is that Iron Man's audience is typically smaller children, and for them, I would say this movie is going to be a bit boring, for it lacks in the action department for the most part. But what may be its downfall box-office-wise is also its greatest accomplishment. Much like the Dark Knight, Iron Man 2 takes the superhero world and not-cheesily but convincingly conveys what it would be like in today's world. Not to mention we actually see Tony Stark go through a hero cycle in this one, without taking away his compulsive and loud personality. All in all, Iron MAn's long awaited release was worth it in my eyes. It was a perfect movie to kick off the Summer hype films and it makes me eager to watch what else Favreau has planned for the franchise.","

+ Sam Rockwell. Literally never bad. Here he is rocking a fake tan.
+ Beat touching briefly on the change of actor for James Rhodes is funny.
+ Action at the Monaco racetrack, although convoluted, is a nice concept and visuals for an action sequence.
+ Iron Man in a massive doughnut with his helmet off eating a doughnut hungover is a cool image.
+ Iron Man suit-case.
+ Mickey Rourke gives us his best, he seems like he gives a damn even if the character sells him short.
+ As implausible as it is when Tony is creating a new element, I mean at least he's doing some science.
+ Scarlett Johanson is saucy as heck.
+ Justin hammer running weapons demo for war machine is silly but hilarious, his 'ex-wife' speech is phenomenal (If it was any smarter it would write a book)!
+ Really cool hud and creative future minority report computer stuff.
+ Hammer drones do look wicked.
+ Fight in the Japanese garden is pretty neat, a little videogame co-op level.Shies away from Demon in a Bottle storyline with some sort of blood toxicity hogwash.If IM1 was a rock concert then IM2 is a rock opera: Theatrical and faux, stuffed to the gills, garish and blowing its budget on nonsense.Don Cheadle's a little annoying here.Upping Tony's bellend factor doesn't make him funnier, just more grating and possibly completely dated and wrong for this new era.It's a little too mumblecorey, the script is a little rambly and even RDJ is more irritable than he is charming. It's not as tight and structured as IM1. Very little important or memorable or even quotable dialogue.Shoehorned world building.Ugly and without a uniform colour scheme or look, the sets and frames are filled with off colours and other incongruities for no good reason.Drunken suit fight during a party where Iron Man DJs then hits Don Cheadle with a barbell to Another One Bites the Dust. Such crass motivation to start War Machine. The entire sequence makes the suits look small, weak, stupid and fallible. Looks incredible plasticky and fake.Music is some awful Danny Elfman plinky plonky Spider-Man nonsense.Stan Lee cameo review: Old Man confused as Larry King: 5/5. Another belter. I mean he does look like Larry King, it's another confusion gag but Lee's face is not only priceless but it might actually be the only good piece of acting he's ever done.End credits review: 2/5: I remember thinking WTF is this? And then getting on to some serious youtubing. It's teeny tiny but effective. A start to the teasers rather than full scenes. Generic lines plus a thunder clap: Didn't really do it for me.","

Iron Man caught me off guard. I was always loved the 'Avengers' (Marvel comics always beat DC in my world), but Iron Man was never one of my favourite characters, but the first movie was right up there with Batman Begins, Spiderman 2, and X-Men 2. For me Iron Man 2 is in that league. This movie was funny, tons of action, great characters, wonderful ideas with subtle touches. I'm not going into the plot or give spoilers.All I want to say is this movie was darn fun and a great summer movie.Please trust me on this one.","

"Troy_Campbell","30 April 2010","Sequels are the most difficult movies to get right. Fickle audiences are anticipating more of what they loved in the first flick, but don't want it to become repetitive. On the flipside they also expect it to be fresh and innovative without it feeling like an altogether dissimilar movie from the original. Trying to find that balance is an extremely tricky thing and most don't succeed. Where does IM2 fit in? It's not in the higher echelon of action sequels alongside The Dark Knight or X2, which bettered their predecessors, but it's definitely not far off and that's no easy feat.Justin Theroux's screenplay is crammed with a plethora of plot strands and for the most part – minus a partially neglected Tony / Pepper subplot here and a wasted opportunity with Vanko there – he manages to juggle them quite effectively. The biting social commentary from the initial film is back in addition to the trademark casual humour not seen in other comic book adaptations, however Theroux has expanded the Iron Man franchise with a slightly more light-hearted approach, undoubtedly due to the burgeoning Marvel movie-universe that is currently being formed. Subsequently there's a much stronger focus on the collective Marvel effort to come in the future, thanks to a larger part for Nick Fury (Jackson) and a couple of teasing moments (make sure you stay until the end of the credits) that hint at other characters looming nearby.Returning in the director's seat is the ever-surprising Jon Favreau, once again helming with confidence and flair. His handle on the action set-pieces increasingly gets better, despite a vaguely underwhelming climactic showdown, with the clash at Monaco's F1 Grand Prix and ruckus at Tony's Malibu mansion the highlights. The special effects team greatly aid Favreau as the CGI is practically faultless; the diverse machinery on show is photo-realistic ensuring the fight and flight sequences look amazing. Sans computer effects, a lithe Johansson rumbling with a handful of Hammer's henchmen will have you in awe, not just because of the outfit worn by Johansson but due to the excellent fight choreography and the fact that most of the stunts were performed by the actress herself.Portraying our uniquely cavalier protagonist, Downey Jr exudes charisma and style yet again. His cocky, eccentric exterior becomes a tad monotonous but never reaches a level that decreases his likability. Unexpectedly the cast member that challenges Downey Jr to best on screen is the equally peculiar and compelling Sam Rockwell. He makes what could have been a smarmy, one-dimensional villain into a humorous and engaging tyrant who even manages to outdo Tony in the comedy stakes. Elsewhere Rourke makes for a suitable tattooed Ruskie, Paltrow and Johannson offer sweet and sexy respectively and Cheadle fills the boots left by Terrence Howard gratifyingly. Kudos to Cheadle and the filmmakers for making the 'new' Rhodey's entrance a memorably quick-witted in-joke too; they swiftly dispel the audiences concern of having a different actor in the role.A rousing follow-up that very nearly matches the brilliant first instalment and will leave you keen for more Iron Man, whether in his own movie or not.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)","

"wibiyana","14 May 2010","I watched IRONMAN2 about two days ago, and I kind of loved it =D, better than the first one, because here Tony Stark went crazier and more unstoppable hahah. Well,, I think here, Robert Downey Jr. didn't act at all, I meant he's definitely Tony Stark, Tony Stark is him! so, no wonder if his performance is really that cool =P, CZ its not about plays somebody Else's character but your own character, just as easy as you to be yourself, although I know that sometimes its kinda difficult to be yourself. But here I am saying that Tony Stark or Ironman is definitely Downey Jr., the genius and crazy, sexy guy hahahah. OK, its enough time to screw around, actually for me, they brought us a new, different paradigm, both Favreau and Downey, different one of a superhero in a witty way of funny and sometimes unpredictable story, and it'll makes you just like ""oh my, cant wait for the next sequel"" or ""damn, he's cool as hell, I love Ironman, I love Tony Stark!"".hmhh..., I liked the Tony's experiment room mostly, man, I absolutely down on my jaws about three meters to the edge of the white screen on the theater 3, when I was watching this movie. often enough I, imagining myself doing something on that room, designing, filming...(if only the room exist) lol. Not just it, I was like WOW by Scarlett, the melodramatic actress acted surprisingly awesome as a secret agent, she even did some action maneuvers, hahaha, pretty magnificent, good job scar-jo! and the Ironman's enemy, Ivan vanko, has a good acting as a god damn terrible freaky smart and ambitious, Russian ...umh,well, can I say ""scientist!?"" and guys, I love his Russian accent, simply stunning =)the one really makes this movie lame, is the kissing scene (tony and pepper) ugh, they should throw away that scene, moreover it was in the almost ending of this movie, oh my..., it was almost destroy the whole this beautifully funny movie, I hate pepper, Paltrow kinda overacting I think..., just easy mom -__-"", she should be replaced by Cate Winslett or Julia Roberts, I think they would be more suit with Stark hehehehe...But overall, I love and enjoy this movie, the actor (Downey), the actress (scar-jo) and the music, especially when tony and Rhodes changed the party hall on Tony's house into a battlefield! will be good to see this even as trilogy or tetra-logy, penta-logy maybe *grin*","

Good performance from Mickey Rourke again, he is making the silent type baddie a niche all of his own.The special effects are great, reminiscent of Minority Report in places but version 2.0! Eye candy and some kick ass moves provided by Scarlett Johannsen, some excellent one liners from all the cast, explosions a plenty, far out James Bond gadgetry and the introduction of Mr cool himself, Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury, all add up to a fun night out.If you want to ""pick holes"", go ahead you'll have a field day, however if you want a good night out go and see the movie, you wont be disappointed.","

"The_Daemon","10 May 2010","A delightful banter heavy super-hero film in which the emphasis of the film is clearly put on the character of the film and less so on the super-heroic exploits and trials that comic-based films generally focus upon. The diminished focus on action pieces might threaten to bog the picture down but the character interactions and their barbed-filled vocal exchanges keep the film moving along at a clean pace until the inevitable CG heavy battle scenes.Not that there is a lack of money spent in terms of CG wizardry on the screen. But instead of merely focusing their efforts on the suit battles, the film is littered with highly detailed sets and the constant use of extremely high-tech holographic touch sensitive technology is all pervasive. Not to diminish the skirmishes involving the Iron Man suit though as they are fun to watch, very smoothly executed and very aesthetically pleasing especially Micky Rourke's frankensteined creation clashing with Tony Stark's ultra-slick technology.The plot itself treads no particular new ground although it does attempt to through in a great many sub-plots and personal dilemmas for the ample cast of characters to deal with. The problem with most of these dilemmas is that they generate very little serious drama as they are mainly dealt with in either a succinct manner or are treated in a rather glib fashion and things just sort of seem to work themselves out almost accidentally due to the increased amount of events and characters involved basically just diluting the situation to the point that it almost seems an afterthought when it is reconciled. This casual dismissive tone carries over to the antagonists as the film spreads itself out a little too thin to the point that what should have been powerful character conflicts involving the major characters just seem like minor scuffles.There is also the odd sort of underlying theme of a stereo-typical conservative American approach to the way in which the film idolizes weaponry and pushes the agenda that America possessing the most powerful weapon in the world would undoubtedly result in an increase in world peace. Then there's also the extra step the film takes that Americans apparently feel more comfortable in having a shallow, fun-loving, but seemingly trust worthy private individual in possession of the most powerful weapon in the world but not their own government.Is the writer trying to make a statement about the current mental state of American with the increase in paranoia and private militias or is it just more poorly thought out Hollywood worship of the Dirty Harry one man army character doing things we are afraid to take responsibility for? The film makes an attempt to explore the folly of this approach by the sudden attack of Ivan Vanko utilizing similar technology that supposedly was beyond the reach of the rest of the world as promised by Stark. This is then further compounded by a frustrated military friend being able to utilize one of the suits which seems improbable considering the vast amount of hack proof machinery that Stark regularly employs. But like with most issues in Iron Man these are just brushed aside or ignored in the face of an impending threat and we are left wondering what became of all that anyways? But despite all these faults I found the film infectiously enjoyable. Despite the fact that many characters aren't utilized to their fullest, they are immediately compelling and a joy to watch when they are on the screen. Micky Roarke is incredibly fun to watch as he is both a brutal thug and a introverted technology wizard who is only truly friendly to his father and his bird. Tony's relationship with his ambiguously defined girlfriend Pepper Potts is very engaging and their constant over-lapping dialogue exchanges were genuinely funny and wholly natural. Of course most of this has to do with Robert Downey Jr.'s great acting abilities and he really elevates the quality of the movie with his level of skill.Despite the intensely glib tone of the movie I found the whole thing very enjoyable. There's nothing new here to be sure, but the abilities of everyone involved elevate the movie as a whole into a very satisfying experience.","

"kdnor2011","18 January 2011","I know I will get a lot of hate for this, but I actually liked this movie more than the first. Now I'm not saying that this film is better than the first, I guess in terms of writing, this is the worst film. However, I had more fun watching this movie. To me, this was the more fun of the two.Now it isn't a perfect film by any means. Pepper Potts wasn't great in the first film, but in this film she seems to have two modes. She's either annoying, or she is a complete idiot. I'm sorry, but if a droid ten feet away from me begins beeping and blinking red, I won't just stand there and look at it, I'm running away as fast as I can. Also, like the first film, there is way more talking then action, in fact there's even less action in this film.However that brings me into the good stuff. While this film has more talking than action, I actually liked the talking. Robert Downey Jr. was hilarious, he always had me smiling. And because of this, despite Stark still being a douche, I liked him a lot more. The film is just full of witty banter. So I liked when there was action and when there wasn't action. And once again my favorite character was Rhodey, once again reminding me of myself. Scarlett Johansen was hot. The two villains made the perfect antagonist. Ivan was intimidating, and Hammer was funny. And I liked the story. It's basically part Iron Man movie, part trailer for the Avengers, and for me it worked.I can't really see why this film was hated by so many people. Sure it has good reviews, and most people seem to like it. But of all the Avengers movies, this one seems to get the most hate. I really enjoyed this movie, it isn't perfect, and the first film is probably a better film, but I enjoyed this movie more.","

None of the characters is really that interesting.I think the story is just way off. There is no onward thrust in the story.The dialog is obscure to say the least when you can understand what they are saying. And what is Stark's problem. The story expects you to understand too much from little hints.Robert Downey Jr needs to speak more slowly and articulate each word.Mickey Rourke is just so bizarre looking.Gwyneth is older looking - her face is drawn but still has a stunning figure.Scarlett is alluring with her dark hair and her action sequence near the end is quite good. But her role is a bit puzzling.Just forget it - its a waste of time. Even the fighting between the silly looking Iron Men is so lame.","

"gradyharp","9 October 2010","IRON MAN II. May he rest in peace. As with so many of these Marvel Comics scripts there are so many add-on characters to disrupt the meager storyline that it seems like the studio tapped everyone who walked by the filming, gave them a few lines and a wow costume and said 'come one in.' Rating an obvious millions of dollars production such as this is duplicitous: CGI 5, acting 3, story 1. But if noise, mayhem, and electrical fires are pleasing to you, then by all means jump aboard this colorful film. Robert Downey, Jr. is a fine actor so he puts as much as he can into the lines allotted him to read. Mickey Rourke is the bad guy with even more tattoos and longer hair than the Wrestler, and with a Russian accent to boot. Don Cheadle plays Don Cheadle, and Sam Rockwell needs a shave as a supposed wily bad guy executive. Samuel L. Jackson attempts to lend some dignity. Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be asking why she bothered until Scarlett Johansson jumps on board to give the film some much need punch. It's good guy versus bad guy - with drones create by Rourke's disenchanted character that attempt unsuccessfully to turn the tide. What's missing is some of Robert Downey, Jr.'s comedic banter and the brakes put on the destruction of the Stark Expo concept. Definitely a film for those who like this sort of high volume comic book outing.Grady Harp","

Had these plotlines been in separate movies, they could've had proper development. Instead, nothing intertwines and the movie is messy. Furthermore, Stark's character doesn't arc. He solves problems, but doesn't grow. In fact, he finishes the movie by mocking his doubters (even though they were right about his technology being a public safety threat). Ultimately, Iron Man 2 only feigns drama around merchandising and action.Technically, Iron Man 2 is a downgrade. Rock music is more sparse, imagery is less dramatic, editing is basic, sound lacks symbolism, and the tone is muddled. The first action sequence is appealing, but the climactic battle is uninspired. Meanwhile, the cast adds several big names, but there's less emotional range for them to explore. Previously, Downey was able to show vulnerabilities that are noticeably missing here. Overall, Iron Man 2 is more like a collection of parts than a cohesive whole. Its individual ideas are interesting, but it's too cluttered to connect. Iron Man 2 is fine entertainment, but it's also a missed opportunity.Writing: 4/10

"thesar-2","9 May 2010","Well, I enjoyed the two action sequences in the two plus hours of Iron Man 2.That's an exaggeration, but not by much. It wouldn't be so bad if the plot could sustain the rest and for the most part, it didn't.And that was the biggest problem with Iron Man 2. Along with the poor editing and the excessive character additions, like the original Batman series, the rushed and over bloated storyline really weighed down the movie. Sure, Downey Jr. did his best, and was a real saving grace, but even he had to realize this movie was not up to par.(Spoiler Alert, but needs to be told as it's the majority of the film) Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is dying due to his heart device, acquired in the first Iron Man, that's poisoning his blood. Oh, sorry. That's plot A. Plot B is about the Government wanting the ""Ironman"" weapon. C involves a secret spy and her not-a-secret boss from another comic book. As for D and E: two revenge-seeking/Stark hating males for alternate reasons. And F is for the conflicted (and replaced actor) friend of Stark. Did I leave any out? Oh, G is for a Walt Disney-like Daddy along with the normal Daddy-Issues. And H is for Giveaways, Charity, Crossovers and a suicidal daredevil.On a personal note, and I'm generally criticized for this – who cares, it's an opinion, I cannot stand Sam Rockwell. Sure Moon was a somewhat good movie, but it wasn't Rockwell that drove that feature. Here, again, he looked out of place and was just plain boring. Like Downey, Jr., he did try, but had an enormously unsuccessful presence. Despite my personal feelings, still, I got what character he was trying to portray, but we've all seen these evil, revenge-minded and jealous corporate guys at least a dozen times before, but with a tremendous amount of believability, pizazz and villainy that Rockwell didn't come close to possessing. Heck, even the unoriginal and obvious villainous character, Obadiah Stane (played by Bridges from the original Iron Man) had the right qualities Rockwell lacked.Though I have a neutral opinion on Rourke, I sincerely felt him miscast in this role and like Rockwell, overshot his ""bad guy role."" It is written that he spent time (visiting, I suppose) a Russian prison and even more time attempting to learn his Russian lines. He even went as far as wanting to do the whole movie in Russian! (Director Favreau thankfully disagreed – he was hard enough to understand when he did speak English.) In probably the worst scene in the movie was their attempt to recreate the Batman/Joker interrogation scene from The Dark Knight. It didn't work as a rip off, nor as a scene on its own. I forgot to mention the not-at-all-funny bird fetish Rourke's character had was his idea. Perhaps he should come back down to earth after his one-time-only great performance in The Wrestler.The rest of the cast was so-so to great. Favreau was funny but his one-man fight seemed so Lethal Weapon 3'ish while Rushman (Johansson) fought off half a dozen or more men. Speaking of Johansson, or her character Rushman, she was great when she kicked butt. Unfortunately those scenes were even fewer than the overall action of the film. Paltrow was so-so and mirrored Vicky Vale (Basinger from Batman) with the number of screams and over-acting/reacting. As previously mentioned Downey Jr. was excellent and kept his scenes going. In fact, for die-hard Downey Jr. fans, this would be a definite recommendation.Overall, the movie felt rushed (and was,) but thankfully due to the always great Downey Jr., the always impressive technology (loved the suitcase,) crossovers (think shield in addition to S.H.I.E.L.D.) and the (good) few and far between action scenes, the movie's worth a viewing. Not on IMAX as I did – I wouldn't go that far. It's more expensive, it's not in 3-D and you get a letterboxed version of it. In fact, it would not be the end of the world to wait for this enormously inferior sequel to his DVD/Bluray.","

"ajs-10","1 May 2010","I very much enjoyed the first film in this series and was hoping for more of the same in the sequel. Fortunately I wasn't too disappointed, it lived up to the first one, maybe not quite as good (sequels seldom are), but a fine effort nonetheless. The setting is New York where Tony Stark, having revealed himself as Iron Man and having brought peace to the world, is holding his Stark Expo, an exhibition of technology from all over the world. An idea originated by his father, Howard.In Russia, Ivan Vanko, brooding after the death of his father, Anton, who had worked with Howard Stark on the early prototype of the power source that now drives Iron Man's suit. He was extradited back to Russia for espionage and made to live in Siberia. Ivan, now seeking revenge works on a suit of his own. Meanwhile back in the USA, Tony Stark has been summoned before a Senate committee who are determined to get him to give them the Iron Man suit for military use. One of the experts called to the hearing is Justin Hammer, one of Stark's former competitors when he made weapons for a living. Bringing his friend, Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes to testify backfires on the committee and Stark wins the day, but things are not over between him and Hammer.Stark now decides to hand control of Stark Industries over to Pepper Potts having discovered his health is at risk from wearing the suit. The papers are drawn up and a woman from the legal department, Natalie Rushman, brings them for signing. She impresses Stark and later becomes Pepper's assistant. Heading to Monaco, Stark decides to compete in a motor race. He is surprised when Ivan Vanko turns up and destroys his car with plasma whips. Fortunately, Pepper is there with his Iron Man suit and he manages to subdue the Russian. Vanko goes to jail but is later sprung by someone who is very interested in his work.Returning home, Stark prepares for his birthday party, but with many things praying on his mind he gets drunk wearing the suit and ends up in a fight with Rhodey. Enter Nick Fury who helps put Stark back on the road to recovery and reveal that someone close to him is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Hammer is due to show the work he has been doing at Stark's Expo and he has a few things he wants to surprise him with. Things are brewing up for a big fight at the end, but I don't want to spoil it for you, I'll just say it's pretty spectacular and Vanko isn't finished with Stark just yet.This is a very well made film with plenty of very well designed and executed special effects. The score is great, but if you put AC/DC, The Clash and Queen in there you're always going to get my vote! The performances were all good, special mentions go to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko. Honourable mentions go to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.I must admit I didn't much care for the character of Tony Stark at first, he is egotistic and narcissistic. As the film went on he did show he does have a human side though. Justin Hammer is equally egotistic which I found made for an interesting dynamic to this good versus evil story. I also had a problem with America being the centre of everything, yet again, it's like the rest of the world doesn't exist! (Apart from Monaco). Although I did find it amusing when Stark is standing in front of a giant US flag projected on a screen with an Australian/British rock band providing the music. But enough of these minor niggles, the film is great fun, not as good as the first one, but as sequels go, it's certainly watchable. Over all, recommended.My score: 7.2/10","

"bkoganbing","9 May 2010","Iron Man 2 brings Robert Downey, Jr. back as Tony Stark, billionaire playboy by day and Iron Man superhero by night. The film does something unusual for a superhero movie, the mask is stripped away and Iron Man's identity is confessed to and revealed. Now everybody wants a piece of Tony Stark.Starting with the Senate Armed Services Committee headed by Garry Shandling has him subpoenaed and ordered to turn over the technology that created Iron Man. As survival was the first goal of the creation that seems like not a good solution to Downey. Rival defense conglomerate head Sam Rockwell also wants in on the technology.In a plot that was lifted from the cult Fifties science fiction classic Red Planet Mars, Rockwell makes a deal with Russian Mickey Rourke to get the technology. Rourke's father apparently was working along the same lines as Downey's father and he feels the Iron Man concept was stolen by him. He and Rockwell make a Faustian bargain.In the meantime Downey just wants to get away from it all and even turns his company over to best girl pal Gwyneth Paltrow. Gwyneth who seems to be all legs in this film is really up in it trying to deal with business and Downey at the same time. Another woman who has some mean limbs herself is security expert Scarlett Johanssen who leaves a trail of broken males strewn in her path when she's on a mission.Of course the special effects are what the movie-going public is paying to see and I note that there is an IMAX version of Iron Man 2 out there which only seems right. If I can I should try to see it in that media.If I had a favorite in the cast I would say it was Rockwell. His rivalry with Downey is something to behold. I do love the way these two market their defense wares for the government. It was like they left the promotion to Vince McMahon. Is this the way of the future?Folks who love the superhero genre will love Iron Man 2. The rest of us are somewhat amused.","

"ringfire211","17 May 2010","Saw IRON MAN 2 over the weekend and thought it was merely okay. Doesn't come close to the original. And I wasn't exactly going crazy about the original one either. The best part was without a doubt the Monaco race track scene where Whiplash makes his entrance. That scene was, in one word, AMAZING!! Probably the greatest entrance of a villain in any superhero movie that I've seen. And the action that follows was equally brilliant! Unfortunately everything else ranged from merely okay to downright baaaad. Tony sitting in a donut was downright cringe-worthy as was Sam Jackson's lame line about exiting the donut. Hardy-harr-harr.. who the heck came up with that one? And the scene where Tony gets drunk and rowdy at the party immediately reminded me of the scene where Peter Parker does the same thing in SPIDER-MAN 3. Yuck!! And I agree with Roger Ebert - the finale was both overwhelming and underwhelming! Overwhelming because of all those hundreds of drones flying around blasting Iron Man with all the firepower they can muster. How the city stayed intact with all those huge fireballs left and right is beyond me. Much less how lucky can one Iron Man get against a slew of such machines. Even by comic-books standards this is really pushing it. But then we get to the showdown we've been waiting for - Iron Man vs. Whiplash! How long does that last? Oh a few measly seconds. Are you kidding me?! How can you create a climax which isn't even 1/4 as great as the racetrack scene. I wish they scrapped all those drones and gave us a proper ending with Iron Man vs. Whiplash. I mean this ending makes the ending in the original one (Iron Man vs. Iron Monger) look like a masterpiece in comparison. And I actually considered THAT one pretty underwhelming - there's just not too much excitement seeing two metal suits clanging against each other.So yeah I thought this one was a considerable drop-off from the first one. The actors were all good (though I still prefer the acting in the first one) and the racetrack scene was superior to anything in the first film but outside of that the story is really uninteresting and bland. And the ending, as I said, was both overwhelming and underwhelming.","

"rockyroberts999","22 May 2010","OK....so let me just start by saying, Iron Man 2 is AMAZING!! It's so good, it made me go unconscious for a little while....well almost. I read so many terrible reviews, so I walked in the theater a little skeptical. What I got was incredible though! It was everything I hoped for and nothing I was worried about it. ""Too many AC/DC songs"" and ""too much Burger King"" were 2 things I kept reading about, so I was kept thinking that it was going to be like a cheesy 2 hour music video/Super Bowl commercial. There were 2 AC/DC songs, which were only 30 second clips and fit the scenes they were in, plus I mean, directors like certain bands; just like Scorsese loves the Rolling Stones and puts tons of their tracks in his stuff, apparently Favreau likes AC/DC. Honestly, I didn't see Burger King anywhere in this movie and I can usually spot product placement instantly because it drives me crazy. It was great though is the bottom line. Even the change to Don Cheadle was fine and I loved first line of, ""I'm here, it's me, get over it,"" which obviously had a double-meaning. I loved all of it. Even Scarlett Johansson was good in it. She didn't have very many lines, so her inability to act well wasn't even noticeable, and she was a bad ass with bad ass fight scenes.I dug it, you'll dig it, go see it.","

"pcongleton-1","20 May 2010","The first Iron Man film seemed more like an action film with a guy in an Iron Man suit than anything else. This film actually felt more like an Iron Man movie and it was a more enjoyable experience. All the usual, excellent cast members, made their appearances. Robert Downey JR. and Gwyneth Paltrow are the returning champs while Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke and Garry Shandling come along for this one. Finally, Scarlett Johansson finds an action role fit for her and it should carry her into Marvel History as the Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff in future film endeavors – I hope. After seeing her in ""The Spirit"" (2008), I was a little worried. Samuel L. Jackson continues his outstanding portrayal of Nick Fury. However, there is a casualty. They still haven't found the right guy for Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. In the last film it was Terrence Howard, who looked the part, but I thought wasn't able to sell it well enough. In fact I laughed at him way too much. This time it hurts, because I like Don Cheadle, but not here. The search continues. The SPFX totally do the job right. There is an excellent introduction in the beginning of the film of our hero to the blaring tunes of AC/DC, that is totally believable and quite exciting. Many of the fight scenes truly give us the feeling that we are seeing a comic-book come to life. What is good about this film is, if you do not know much about Iron Man that does not matter. Anybody will enjoy this one and can follow along with the story. Mickey Rourke adds a nicely acted dimension as the bad guy that Tony Stark's Iron Man has to face. I rather enjoyed this film after having a bad taste in my mouth after watching the first one.","

After seeing Iron man 1 I thought, what can they do different in Iron man 2, but it really worked out great.After seen so many superhero movies, it is known that it's hard to make a good third movie (see the original spider man movies). It is hard to top the first two. Now they are going to make Iron Man 3. I have seen the cast list on IMDb and I'n eager to see the movie. Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, William Sadler. I am not going to mention the whole cast list, but what bothered me is why Anthony Michael Hall is not listed. It would be great to see him again with Robert Downey Jr. in a movie.","

Before i watched this i have read a lot of negative or mixed reviews and had been worrying a little, but now i'm glad it appeared to be much better than it had been described.This sequel is more ""depressive"" and less funny than the first one but it has a more mature look to it. The story develops well and Mickey shows some heavy acting: less words, more action and thinking.Robert Downey falls in the first half of this sequel but gets up after an amazing discovery. His female partners as always charming and play their respective roles but nothing more.All in all it was a great experience and now i want to see the third part.","

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","6 July 2019","I love the first Iron Man I like Iron Man 2 It is a big step down from the first movie, seen it for the first time I try to understand the movie what they try to do with this film. The acting, the tone everything in this movie fall flat, but it is decent at least is not boring or stupid like Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) that movie sucks so much!!! It is a damn good action MCU movie I am taking ""Iron Man 2"" over the new MARVEL films anytime . It is part of my life so Iron Man 2 is a decent okay action film at best. They are worst MARVEL films I totally hate than the second entry in ""Iron Man"" trilogy. Iron Man 2 I will still watch it. Iron Man 2 is good/bad mixed film and an okay at best.The action sequences are good specially the fights on a race track with Whiplash and Iron Man I like that. Samuel L. Jackson is perfect as Nick Fury I wish his character would have more much to do, but the screen writer did not let his character more to do except giving Tony Stark advices. I liked that Tony Stark tried to fix the things he broke it and he tried to make sure with the new element that he structured in his arc reactor and ends his palladium so that he want die. Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff was her first gig and she was okay I liked her. But acrobatic stunts Johansson's stuntwoman for the fights in which Black Widow fights off Hammer's bodyguards were all fake and not realistic.AC/DC return for this film with three soundtracks: Thunderstruck, Shoot to Thrill and Highway to Hell I like those songs for the movie. So yes AC/DC is one of the reasons why I don't consider Iron Man 2 as the worst MCU movie ever. Listen to this soundtracks and you will enjoy your self. The opening scene in which Iron Man jumps off the plane and you hear that song I like very much. I mean Robert Downey Jr. didn't do a terrible performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man but his character in this movie was a disaster. Paul Bettany's voice as JARVIS is till good and like able to the film.The rest of the film is a completely disaster they make Iron Man in to total joke in this movie. Jon Favreau ruined the movie what was he thinking? And he got crap for Iron Man Three while in that movie he was decent in here he wasn't. Iron Man 2 is MILES much way better film than Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) I will never watch that movie again!!!","

"illbebackreviews","18 May 2013","Often considered to be a critical disappointment that cannot match the same brilliance as the original, I was sceptical about watching this film. As one of the people who liked the original but didn't love it, I thought that maybe I wouldn't be as sorely disappointed by this film as die hard Iron Man fans were. The thing with this film is that most viewers either love it or hate it so it is truly difficult to take a side in it.Iron Man 2 tells the story of Tony Stark who has now revealed that he is indeed Iron Man and continues to enforce peace across the world until he meets a new enemy who has his plans to get revenge on Stark, whilst at the same time discovering that he is dying. Will Stark be able to keep his legacy and ensure that the people believe in Iron Man or will he fail? To be fair, I didn't hate this movie. I actually really liked it. Surely not as great as the original but this film sure nears it in my opinion. With dazzling visual effects, a mostly outstanding script that makes way for many laughs throughout the film, Iron Man 2 is a mostly engaging film with a great story and extremely special action sequences. I love in this film how Stark is once more put to test and how the original ended with Stark revealing that he is Iron Man. That allows the film to be free of any restrictions and give more fun to the film. Some of the stuff that Stark does throughout the film are truly idiotic and hilarious, and can only be thought of as hilarious due to the performance that Robert Downrey Jr gives.Robert Downrey Jr is truly the scene stealer and he just completely steals the film in every way. He is energetic, he is charming, he is funny yet he can also be a more dramatic person. Everyone else does a great job in the film, mainly Samuel L Jackson playing S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury. His performance isn't anything special from Jackson like Pulp Fiction but his presence is always welcome throughout the film. Scarlett Johannsson is great in the role of Natasha and the final action sequences in the film with her were truly great.Iron Man 2 is not nearly as great as its predecessor but is nevertheless, a fun and entertaining film with plenty of laughs and plenty of amazing visual effects and some absolutely fantastic action sequence. In terms of its action, it is possibly better than the original and also has a greater villain. The acting is fantastic by Robert Downrey Jr and everyone else does their part well. Iron Man 2 is nevertheless an engaging film and is honestly, either a guilty pleasure for myself or an underrated and overly criticized film.","

This movie is a complete success from the very beginning, containing exciting action scenes, invoking concern from us viewers, and making us laugh. The roles were well acted by everybody. Robert Downey Jr is an on screen delight...his method of acting is so much fun to watch. He has a charisma that many actors of today seriously lack. He took on the role of Tony Stark as if he was truly that man. He had perfect chemistry with everyone, and I was sorry to see the movie end. I haven't seen many of RDJ's older movies, but as far as I'm concerned, I plan to see everything he makes from now on!","

Juvenile. Predictable. Embarrassing.Supposedly Mickey Rourke actually spent time in a Moscow prison and studied Russian history to ""prepare for his role"" ... erm, for what exactly, to play a human cartoon? If you'd told me he got the part in the morning and was shooting by midday I'd have no reason to doubt that. His character was stunningly dreadful. As were everyone else of course.Only bright spot in an otherwise abysmal 2 hours of cinematic shite was Sam Rockwell. As ever, he's interesting and fun to watch.

It had everything a sequel needs, it had a good plot to follow the first movie, it had a worthy villain, and some good acting, which Marvel casts never disappoint in. Just like The Incredible Hulk, this was a very underrated MCU movie. I gave The Incredible Hulk and 8/10 (7.5/10), I think this movie deserves a 7.8/10, not quite an 8/10, but still a pretty high score. I thought the Final battle scene was the best of the first three MCU movies, the other two were just too short, this was was nice and semi-lengthy without becoming boring, that is all you can ask for. I also enjoyed that we got introduced to Black Widow in this movie, even though Scarlett Johansson wasn't the first choice to play Black Widow, I think she did a fantastic job, and can't wait to see what she does with the character next.I really enjoyed this movie, I honestly recommend it to anyone who watched the first movie, it is a great movie overall.","

"uofmsuperfan12","29 May 2010","The second installment of this Marvel series does not disappoint. Downey Jr. is once again a hit with a stunning performance as the narcissistic Tony Stark. This time around Tony is dealing with a health problem; the same miniature Arc-reactor that is keeping him alive, is also killing him. The metal needed to run the device is poisoning him. Stark starts down a destructive path until helped out by Sam Fury, who surfaced in the after-the-credits spoiler of the first movie, and the drop-dead gorgeous Scarlett Johansson. Don Cheadle enters as the replacement for Terrence Howard as Stark's best bud Jim Rhodes. Mikey Rourke continues his action-movie prowess as the villain and Rhodes and Stark team up as Iron man and War Machine to bring him down. An action-packed thriller, Iron Man 2 keeps all on the edge of their seats.Also of note, fans of the upcoming Avengers movie, based off the Stan Lee superhero team, will enjoy the not-so-subtle look at Captain America's shield and of the after-the-credits allusion to a Thor movie.","

"moviemavens","9 May 2010","""I.privatize.world peace"" sums it all.The novelty of ""Iron Man"" hasn't worn off on me. While it would never be the same as witnessing the first scene of Iron Man soaring into space and the joy of the trial and error, Iron Man is still the only one of its kind that is as grounded in future reality as it could be.Tony Stark is one of the rare exceptions of being a publicly known superhero. And possessing the traits of a superhero, he does not. Robert Downey Jr. doesn't disappoint in the sequel wherein the world knows him not only as the billionaire weapon manufacturer extraordinaire, but more pivotally as The Man in armored suit.RDJ is the brain, heart and soul of Iron Man. It makes me wonder whether the script was written to be specifically tailored to him. Bold and brash, he's got that smug and swagger that commands the world over. Naturally narcissistic and sarcastic, over-sized just doesn't cover it as far as his ego goes. Never known for subtleties, his flashy style and fast-paced lifestyle suits him just fine - even in his quest to discover the new energy source since the arc-core machine that keeps his heart beating is also slowly poisoning his blood.RDJ's personality carries every single scene that he's in. Numerous outrageously riotous one-liners bring on continuous giggles and laugh out-louds. Be it frivolous or witty or sarcastic, Stark goes toe-to-toe with the newly minted CEO of Stark Industries aka love-interest Pepper Pots, newly appointed eye-candy secretary with an ulterior motive aka Black Widow, Hammer the competitor with an ambitiously ambiguous agenda, or Nick Fury from yes, the upcoming Avengers team (sidenote: the geeks in us would notice Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer). Everyone seems to have so much fun and it shows. I don't recall ever laughing so hard for so long in a non-comedic movie! And Whiplash... what an entrance! I totally didn't expect the Monaco mayhem to happen early. With connected past through their fathers, he's a worthy adversary. The Grand Prix thrill of the peril where Whiplash faces off with Stark sans suit is the stealer of the movie (and the manner in which he ends up donning the suit is a real treat), even more so than the last sequence of dash, smash and blast of the battle of the war machines in the end. Although the mass zig-zag laser cut or the armed superobots is the incredible icing on the metal. If there's a ""flaw"" in all these, Don Cheadle as war machine is too flawless to be believable. Not anyone clad in the suit is ""Iron Man."" One might argue that this ""Iron Man"" lacks heart, but I tend to think that it's just as it's supposed to be. ""Iron Man"" doesn't take itself seriously; it's a nonstop joyride starring a wisecracked eccentric atypical superhero, and it deftly delivers.The MovieMaven http://themoviemaven.posterous.com","

"Bruce722","24 May 2013","This movie was nowhere near as good as the first one. First of all, I hate when they replace main characters in movies. I understand that it's not necessarily the fault of the film but replacing Terrance Howard with Don Cheadle affects the feel of the movie; similar to when they replaced Katie Holmes with Maggie Gylenhaul in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Also, a technology that was pushed to be so incredible and impossible to replicate in the first installment is thrown around in this movie like if it's no more rare than an std. Lastly, similar to the first film, there were some huge plot holes. If a villain's weapons are a sort of lasso, wouldn't common sense tell you to just fire on him from outside of the lasso range? I would certainly think a genius like Tony Stark would be able to figure that out. Also, if you access the main computer and can reset the War Machine, why couldn't you also reset the others? Nonetheless, Robert Downey Jr. once again proves to be a top notch actor in Hollywood and the movie's transition to the ""Avengers"" adds some excitement to an otherwise quick and overrated ending. Still, I was a little disappointed.","

"coasterdude44","11 December 2019","An entertaining sequel and a competent continuation in the Marvel franchise, the film is focussed more on Tony Stark's personal life and his contribution to to his company of Stark Industries. The cgi special effects have improved from the first film quite a bit and the characters are just as entertaining as ever. The film does lull a bit in some parts and is a bit unevenly paced, however the action scenes do make up for some of the parts that drag on a bit longer than others.It is my least favourite film in the trilogy but it still makes up for some of it's flaws, it could have been handled much worse as the realm of sequels is always rocky to tread on in a lot of ways. But if you're a fan of Marvel this movie wont disappoint you and I do recommend it","

"chains01","14 May 2010","Taking place six months after the first Iron Man, Iron Man 2 finds a world where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has successfully ""privatized world peace,"" but fearing other countries getting their hands on Stark's Iron Man technology the Senate seeks to have Tony hand over the technology to the government. Also seeking to steal Stark's technology is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who wants to regain a weapons contract with the military. Complicating things further, a mysterious Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) turns up to destroy Tony Stark.Iron Man was a huge surprise when it came out in the early summer of 2008. A 2nd tier Marvel comic book, Iron Man became one of the top grossing movies of 2008, and even held it's own very well against the juggernaut that was The Dark Knight despite it's much smaller fanbase. It also resurrected Robert Downey Jr.'s career, showing that he was capable of leading a franchise despite his past mistakes, and showed that Jon Favreau was a viable action director. Since then Downey has found himself nominated for two Golden Globes winning one of them, and added yet another big action franchise to the current notch in his belt. Of course, all eyes are on Iron Man 2 to see if the movie will top it's predecessor in the expectations department, so how does it hold up.In my opinion, Iron Man 2 equals it's predecessor. The second installment of Iron Man is funnier than the original, and it ups the ante on the action from the first movie as well. What really makes the movie though, is not the action, but the characterizations. Fleshing out Stark's narcissism as well as his inabilities to deal with his emotions opens new doors into the character. Favreau and new writer to the series Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunderdo a great job of handling a large cast that would normally sink most other comic book franchises.The casting in this movie is superb even if it seems jarring to see so many actors and actresses playing characters that aren't typical for them. Apart from The Spirit and The Island, Scarlett Johansson hasn't played an outright action fueled character, but she equips herself admirably to play the part of a believable martial arts trained heroine. Don Cheadle does a great job taking over the role of Rhodey from Terrence Howard, and even tops his predecessor. Sam Rockwell does a superb job as Stark's rival, and a man who tries his hardest to be as iconic as Tony Stark, but fails miserably on all counts. Mickey Rourke steals nearly every scene he's in, though, as Russian physicist Ivan Vanko. I was never sure if I would be able to buy him as a Russian, but the work he put into researching for the character definitely paid off.On the downside though, sometimes it feels as though there's too much of a rush to get from one point to the next. Scenes feel as though they move to the next before they're truly done playing out. Unfortunately, this is one of the issues of having such a large cast that needs to have proper screen time to flesh out the characters. To add to that, the second half of the film is a bit derivative of other action films. While the film may do a great job of going in a different direction than other comic book films by outing it's central character and performing a character study on a man who thrives on his popularity in that position, but in the last act of the movie it falls into the same trap as other action movies with an ending that can be cliché.All in all, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like movies based on comic books and if you like the first Iron Man. Franchises like Iron Man, the current Batman series, and Kick-Ass set a new benchmark for comic book movies and action movies in general. With great action, acting, characterization, and originality these movies have moved beyond their genres to capture something that extends beyond it's core audience.4.5/5","

"zofos","21 May 2010","The first Iron Man was a delight to behold. When Tony Stark eventually took to the skies in his fully-operational red Iron Man suit and flew to Afghanistan, the movie took on a giddy, magical feel not seen since ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeve back in the day. It was so clear what Iron Man could do and who his enemies were.The same cannot be said for ""Iron Man 2"" which is lumbered with a script that is just dreadful and fails to deliver on every level.Take the first scene between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow. The makers must have been trying to do some sort of rapid-fire screwball comedy dialogue but all they succeed in doing is getting the actors to talk over one another so its hard to make out what's being said. What they say isn't funny or interesting either, it's all shallow sound bites.Superhero movies are only as good as their villain, e.g. Doc Ock in ""Spiderman 2"" or Lex Luthor in Chris Reeves ""Superman"" movies. The villain in ""Iron Man 2"" is a Russian called Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke (I hope he was paid well, as it does nothing for him or his career.) Whiplash makes his big arrival in the movie by attacking Tony Stark's racing car with electrified whips. This is a good start but once Whiplash has his whips taken from him, he becomes a very ordinary villain indeed with no other special powers to threaten Iron Man with. He is taken off to jail almost immediately and fades into the background for most of the film. It makes Whiplash look foolish instead of menacing and the character never recovers. His motivation for attacking Tony Stark/Iron Man is also not very clear or convincing, something about his father being betrayed by Stark's father but it's never explained any further(a flashback might have helped).Scarlett Johannson looks gorgeous and tough as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff. She has some killer moves but strangely never gets to use them on the villain Whiplash. That would have made the script more interesting.There is also an appearance by Samuel L. Jackson wearing an eye-patch that seems to set up the long-in-development Avengers movie that teams up the Marvel characters. It's a diversion about money that we don't need, it takes us out of the story when it should be all about getting Whiplash.Then there's the finale. Whiplash attacks Stark again and fails...again (he's clearly incompetent). The resolution is far too easy. There's no twist to make Stark work hard for victory and that's boring.Sam Rockwell, as the other villain, unveils a series of drone-style Iron Men and they gang up to attack Iron Man and his pal (Don Cheadle also in an Iron Man suit) but there are so many flying around at the end and the editing is so rapid that it's hard to tell what's happening. It's muddled, where the original ""Iron Man"" was crystal clear. That's the problem with this sequel. It feels rushed. The stench of desperation to top the first movie comes off the screen. Better take more care with ""Iron Man 3.""P.S. Sam Rockwell's dancing is hilarious. It's almost worth another star.","

When Iron Man come on the scene in 2008 as a remake of the original comic book, I said it wouldn't last. I was completely, out-of-my-freaking-mind, THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!!! I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7 May 2010","Superhero movie follow-ups have been a tough business lately. ""Iron Man 2"" marks Marvel's first sequel since ""Spider-Man 3"" left millions disappointed in 2007. So to quell any lingering fears, ""Iron Man 2"" is not a letdown. It's far from it. To think director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey Jr. would lose sight of what they did that turned a lesser Marvel character into a multi-million-dollar franchise would be a gross underestimation.Downey Jr. does not relinquish Iron Man's reputation as the wittiest superhero ever brought to the big screen. ""Iron Man 2"" provides just as much of a humorous joyride as the 2008 film, backing up all the subtly outrageous dialogue with superb visual effects and action that seizes all attention. It all still works because Favreau has locked down the blend between not taking the story too seriously but still telling it with conviction.But oh yes, ""Iron Man 2"" complicates things a bit. Self-outted billionaire superhero Tony Stark aka Iron Man has a lot on his plate from government subpoenas asking him to hand his suit over to the people to a private matter: his fake heart -- the arc reactor -- is slowly poisoning him. Feeling like it all might cave in on him, Tony makes his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), Stark Industries' new C.E.O. Screenwriter Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder"") accepts the responsibility of weaving these plot lines in with three new significant characters. Mickey Rourke assumes the villain role: silently vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko, who after a failed attempt at using his own whip-toting arc-reactor suit to kill Tony in the film's first action sequence on a Monaco raceway, finds himself in the employ of Tony's arms-dealing nemesis, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). With Tony going in and out of the public's good graces, Hammer uses Vanko to create droid soldiers for the military, which would effectively make him the real ""American hero."" Scarlett Johansson goes redhead for a supporting role as one of Tony's new assistants who is more than she appears to be.The busyness continues because of Marvel's commitment to an eventual ""Avengers"" film in 2012 combining Iron Man and heroes of future Marvel films. Samuel L. Jackson appears as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D, looking to recruit Tony for his team and nudging him in the right direction as Tony's deceased father, Howard, holds the answer to his ""heart condition.""The overcrowding, however, never gets the best of ""Iron Man 2."" Theroux has designed the story to move along quickly and effectively, letting the action and the humor carry the entertainment factor evenly throughout the film. The unfortunate trade-off is that very little resonates about ""Iron Man 2."" Tony's attempt to find a new core element for his arc reactor is the one true through-line. Everything else from Tony's feuding with Pepper and his buddy Jim Rhodes (Cheadle) to Hammer's frustrations with Vanko's progress to Nick Fury all act in service of the plot. The element of Tony's irresponsibility and alcoholism, perhaps the greatest potential of the film to make any kind of statement, appears in only a couple brief scenes. Downey Jr. and Favreau give us many great Tony Stark moments, but he doesn't have a chance to grow -- just make us laugh and remember how great a character he is.And honestly, how great a character he is. Downey Jr.'s shtick hasn't gotten old in the least despite his increased exposure the last two years and the writing caters to him even more this time around. Maybe a lesser actor playing a lesser character wouldn't be able to lift up a busy superhero story with this many subplots, but RDJ has that ability. With an imaginative visual effects crew at his back and a director who knows how to condense action and make it count, he'll likely continue providing easy-to-love action entertainment as Iron Man no matter how many different chinks these films develop in their armor.-Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","

"funkyfry","22 November 2010","I'm not a huge fan of this series..... the first film started out exceptionally poor with horrible racial stereotypes and ridiculous effects, then entered an interesting and entertaining middle stage that dealt with anti-hero issues, and concluded in a predictable underwhelming confrontation. The sequel has a more exciting battle at the end, but very little before it to really keep me interested. From its first moments it presents a cliché landscape of cgi robot action, PG-13 level exploitation values, and absurd character relationships.The new writer, Justin Theroux, has produced a film that plays even more to the lowest common denominator, which is quite surprising considering his public persona as a fringe badboy in terms of acting (he's appeared in many David Lynch films, among others). The film lacks any sense that there's a larger structure hanging over the proceedings. About the only ongoing plot is the idea that Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is sick/dying and that Pepper Potts (Paltrow) doesn't know about it. Everything about the film is designed not to exceed the capacity or appetite of 14 year old boys. Theroux is clearly primarily a comedy writer, as evidenced by his only previous credit on ""Tropic Thunder"" (a much more entertaining Downey Jr. film and performance).The worst thing about films such as this, and the Pirates of the Caribbean films with Johnny Depp, is that they have proved that the best actors of our generation can be debased and turned into engines for boring action franchises. There was a time when serious actors wouldn't go near a kiddie movie like this. While Downey Jr. provides much of the film's humor, you have to feel like he's wasting his own time as much as ours. Mickey Rourke, after a nice performance in ""The Wrestler"", reminds us once again of why he lost popularity in the first place: his performance is all smug and self-satisfied, as if it's enough to be a villain to speak in an awful Russian accent and walk around with a smirk. And what was with the bird? It was like he complained to the scriptwriter and they gave him that as a ""character quirk"" even though it has no meaning and does nothing for the film.Very poorly written film executed in a highly predictable way","

"sjd615","30 May 2010","The sequel in the Iron Man series is one that is very welcoming, original for a second movie and a great blast of a movie to kick off the summer right. It was a lot of fun, there WAS a great villain, awesome action scenes with likable characters. The movie was a perfect length at about 2 hours but some scenes I felt could have been left out and even a character as well. As Scarlett Johanson is very attractive her character could have easily been never put in because there is no real importance even though it was refreshing and she brings the sex appeal to the movie goers. I really enjoyed the movie and it is actually a worth while sequel to an eventually long and spread out series in the future. This second film was an exiting experience that had comic relief in certain parts of the movie. It is not full of action but when there is, it is very cool as the special effects are awesome. Overall, i recommend all movie fans to see this movie. It is a great time, not really any swearing and suitable for the kids of all ages.","

"kelboy10","1 November 2019","With Starks alter ego Iron Mans status well and truly established on the world, a new terror is rising in Ivan Vanko. Mickey Rourke plays the cold hearted Vanko, distant, undisturbed and focused on nothing but his mission. The mission to avenge his father and pay a dept he believes the Stark family owe. Much like the first movie the light hearted charm remains in Stark and Pepper. Iron Man 2 is a rollercoaster ride. Stark is unwilling to give up his technology and weapons now the world knows he is Iron Man and arrogant in his beliefs that the rest of the world is nowhere near in designing a battle suit close to his. Expert research must have been made because because Robert Downey Jr is the personification of Stark and Iron Man. Each character has been perfectly cast for this movie. Mickey Rourke is excellent as the Russian hell bent on revenge a vendetta that goes back to his father being exiled from stark industries. Don Cheadle is now playing Rhodes and although I prefer Terrace Howard in this role Don Cheadle is worthy of the part as war machine. Reluctant to dulvage the secrets of his technology Stark is boastful and makes more enemies in fellow business man Justin Hammer. Overall the film is similar to the first and doesn't really bring nothing new to the table, but I'd say Rourke has more screen time than Jeff Bridges had in the first film and made for a more compelling villain. The effects and locations make for an all round well thought out movie and although the story has no real twist it has enough to keep viewers watching.","

"blacklist-1","2 May 2010","I though the first Iron Man was really great, with a new idea and great story, superb action and great acting with enough in depth about the characters to make you care and give the story substance, but I'm afraid Iron Man 2 just falls into the typical sequel trap of just trashy fun wanting to cash in on the first. It is great fun. Downey Junior is still excellent as Stark and very funny. The action sequences were fun and the special effects were amazing. Not to mention there was some good music and Downey Jr gave the script in parts wit.But the script was mostly awful with thin characters. I could see the director Jon Favreau try to flesh them out but the multiple stories didn't work, which loses that in depth of the characters and why we care for them. He tries to do the multiple narrative like Sam Raimi in Spiderman 2 who successfully had the main story with there sub-plots that blended seamlessly together beautifully with the depth of the characters understanding the motivations behind there choices and decisions and making you care about them but Favreau fails in this respect. Micky Rourke dosen't make a lasting impression as villain Whiplash and Scarlet Johansson though pretty was extremely underused. There is not motivation for her character. Also there are some gaping plot holes like why when Whiplash escapes from prison is it not reported by the media? And he goes to the grand prix track to kill Stark whose one of the drivers but he didn't even know he was there because he arrives before he sees him and we're not made aware Whiplash knows he's there making the character and film a bit dumb and forfeiting credibility as a result. Saying that there was plenty of action sequences, which were done really well and were exciting to watch as a result. But on the flip side, it leaves too little room for story and character development (whereas Batman Begins and Spiderman 2 balanced out the action and story perfectly).Good trashy fun yes, which I enjoyed but it's not as amazing as people make out. I really was expecting much more and I was quite disappointed on the whole. This had potential and I could tell Favreau tries with the multi-plots but it just fails. This dosen't live up to the hype it's received but it's still worth seeing. I hope the third shows improvement.","

"Someguysomwhere","14 September 2010","The plot: There are 2 story threads here that merge. 1. The government and military are putting pressure on Tony Stark to turn over the Iron Man Technology to them. 2. Some Russian guy blames Tony's dad for the persecution and death of his own father and seeks revenge. How he goes about it ties into the government's claims that the Iron man technology is better served by giving it to them. Analysis: Enjoyable action-filled movie; well acted and written. Worth your time. If you're not a comic book buff or nut you don't need to read further. You have all you need.Some entertainers (actors, musicians, athletes, IMDb reviewers,etc.) use a ""stage"" name and the public is generally unaware of their real name or private identity. But if some find out what their real name is (as sometimes happens) it might not matter because they're more familiar with the stage name and persona and prefer it. In this instance the private identity is eclipsed or overshadowed by the familiar and public persona. However, because Tony Stark is well known in his own right as a famous inventor and head of a well known company (Stark Industries, Inc.) this would not happen. Not to mention the fact that he enjoys attention; seems to need it; thrives on it; is a bit of a ham.So I gotta ask: when people see Iron Man flying across the sky, do they say, ""There goes Iron Man"", --or do they say, ""There goes Tony Stark""? There are practical reasons why super heroes (and people involved in important and dangerous operations) need a secret identity; need to maintain a separation; and I'm sure you can guess them. So while I enjoyed the movie, and while I know it's just fantasy, I cannot help but wonder at the unnecessary and foolish recklessness and vanity of Tony Stark that makes him put so much at risk in order to share the limelight with his alter ego Iron Man. And this is beside the point: What is it about good-looking women in form-fitting outfits that beat people up that turns me on? Love, Boloxxxi.","

"jonnyfendi","30 April 2010","It is always exciting every time we watch Iron Man movie. Complete action package, great characters interest and interlude with effective humor. Tony Starks is an eccentric, self-centered but genius multi-billionaire who builds Iron Man suit. Thiz time, he faces health issue and ready to confront another thread from his business rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and mysterious villain Whiplash (Mickey Rourke). In the first Iron Man two years ago, I said to everyone that Tony Starks in that movie was too humanist, which was so wrong. Starks should appear more arrogant to present his original character (If you ask me thiz kind of stuff. Well, comic is my world. I recall when my dad bought me first Iron Man's issue from overseas). But at thiz sequel, Iron Man character really fills my expectation. Robert Downey Jr. acts amazingly well, improving his first appearance. The most powerful element in Iron Man's movies is simply Robert Downey Jr. himself. Mickey Rourke is our other attention after his breathtaking performance in ""The Wrestler"" (2008). He plays save for his villain character and it looks just fine. For the fight scene, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is surprisingly kick ass. I don't know whether is the camera angle or the fight choreography that makes it so attractive, Johansson really left behind her girly image. Unfortunately, I don't like Nick Fury's character (Samuel L. Jackson) which is reconstructed from Nick Fury's original character. Other mentionable performances are Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. The movie is directed by former Actor, Jon Favreau. His previous directing credits are ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005) and the comedy ""Elf"" (2003). It's almost very difficult to say thiz movie isn't a good one. Apparently it's an excellent and entertaining movie for everyone. Can't wait for another Starks Expo!

His scenes in the first act are excellent.And then there's of course the introduction of Scarlet Johanssen as Natasha/Black Widow. Damn if she doesn't suck up all the air in every single scene she's in as she insinuates herself into Stark's inner circle. She morphs from Tony's ""siren"" (Stark's a better man than I would likely be in a similar circumstance) to a bad-ass MMA fighter.It actually calls out the absurdity of not spinning off a Black Widow off earlier. This was clearly pre-Me Too, but shameful nonetheless.The special effects are again excellent.

"caseynicholson","30 January 2015","""Iron Man 2"" is the third chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, i.e. the third Marvel Comics movie produced in-house at Marvel Studios. This second episode of ""Iron Man"" sees Robert Downey, Jr. turn out a strong performance as Tony Stark, and the cast of the film does a similarly grand job as that of the original.One notable change in the movie is that Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes is now played by Don Cheadle, as opposed to Terrence Howard who filled the role in the first ""Iron Man"" film. Both Howard and Cheadle turn out strong performances in this role, and it's hard to say which does a better job, but it is a bit of a glaring change, with Cheadle looking so dissimilar from Howard.The rest of the cast all do quite well in this movie, including Gwyneth Paltrow, reprising her role as Pepper Potts, and Mickey Rourke who plays the film's villain, Ivan Vanko (a character who features characteristics of both the Crimson Dynamo and Whiplash, villains from the Iron Man comic books).All in all this film is a strong chapter in the MCU's ongoing Iron Man storyline. The film develops the Tony Stark character, matching it with the classic comic book Tony Stark by introducing us to not just the billionaire playboy, but also to the Stark that struggles with alcoholism and whose own contraption that saved his life is now endangering him with radiation poisoning. Both of those plot features are drawn straight from the 1980's mythology of Iron Man. Likewise, the film goes a step further by introducing us to a larger piece of the MCU puzzle by giving us more information on SHIELD and Howard Stark. Black Widow (aka Natasha Romanov, played by Scarlett Johansson) is also introduced in this movie, and is featured prominently.While it's probably fair to say that this movie falls just short of being as good as its predecessor, again, it's certainly a great, fun movie from Marvel. I rate it at 8/10 stars.","

Is it as good as Iron Man 1 or 3? No, but it is still amazing, and compared to some of the new mcu films, I'm sure everyone would be very happy to get another movie like this again. I also think that the newer movies are rated higher cause of more mcu fanboys and fan girls, but this movie came out when there were less fans and trust me to movie is amazing, it just didn't live up to the iron man 1 standard, but it's a great fun film.","

"thepriceofpayne","15 April 2018","Iron Man 2 is the Third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the second film in the Iron Man Franchise, and sadly its not one of those sequels that surpasses the original. While not terrible, Robert Downey Jr. is still as charismatic as ever and we get some great character introductions from Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson, with Don Cheadle replacing Terrance Howard. (which in my opinion was a great replacement) The Story does focus more on The character of Tony Stark, which isn't bad but it's a lot of story and story with little pay off. The action in the end is great, the acting is on par, and Favreau is one of my favorite directors, but the film is just okay. I expected more, but I didn't get anything less.","

"Fluke_Skywalker","28 August 2014","'Iron Man 2' has a reputation for being both not as good as the original and for being bogged down by set-up for 'The Avengers'. Both of these things are certainly true, but they're ultimately not tragic flaws.Though the villains and the stakes feel inconsequential, 'IM2' zips along at a fast clip, and fueled by great performances and a far more exciting and satisfying finale than its predecessor, it manages to entertain while also laying the foundation that the entire MCU is built upon.Flaws and all, 'Iron Man 2' is still a worthwhile entry into the MCU, and well worth revisiting for those who may not have liked it the first time.","

"islander7one","30 April 2010","Well, it's happened again for the armored Avenger. It's no wonder that everyone is again praising Iron Man in some way. Iron Man 2 is the best comic adaptation movie ever made. The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. Now, the sequel advances as well if not better than the previous great ""number 2's"" in history. Spider-Man 2, X2 and TDK all took the second films of the franchise to new heights. Iron Man 2 does the same and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 2 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle was certainly an upgrade. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. It utilizes great dialogue that's witty, perfect use of humor yet again, advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best sequel of the decade. This is truly movie-making of the highest order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. Long live the new king! What makes Iron Man a true rarity is that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult. How many movies can you say that about?","

"RCWjr","10 May 2010","I have given Iron Man 2 the same 8 rating I gave the original. Mainly because both are flawed films, but in the end, are rousing, fun summer movies that do not cater to the lowest common mind level, yet don't take themselves too seriously.Iron Man 2 starts out, much like Spiderman 3, with Tony Stark seemingly basking in the glow of Iron Man's accomplishments (it is set 6 months after the first film). However we learn quickly that Tony is hiding a pain within; the reactor is slowly killing him. A long with that, we learn Tony and his father were not very close, more angst to throw into the pot. Thus we have Tony Stark slowly going out of control and his friends; Pepper, Happy and Rhodie must pull him in.The first half comes off a bit uneven to me, not sure why, it just never seemed to find a steady groove. It is not the pace, as with the first, there is never any moments of watch checking, it just had an uneven flow of one scene to the next for me, like they were trying to find the groove but not quite getting it. It isn't until an hour into the film that it finally found a rhythm for me. Once it did find that rhythm it brought the film home, with an excellent 3rd act.Performances across the board are excellent. I have to say I missed Howard as Rhodie. Cheadle is by no means a slouch actor, but he doesn't have the same presence in uniform that Howard had. Johanson brings everything you would expert to the siren role she is cast in. Definitely look forward to seeing more of her in further adventures. Rourke is his usual method self, totally absorbed in the role of Whiplash and eating up every scene he is in.One of the things I enjoyed most about the film is the continual interweaving of the whole Marvel universe, especially the hints of other characters involved with the Avengers. We are actually introduced to the Avenger concept in the film, which, for the comic geeks out there, will be a glorious thing to witness. Another is the expanded role of Tony's father, which is done through old news and company reel, but helps to give us more of a full view of the Stark patriarch and more importantly, his feelings toward his song Tony, who has felt he never quite measured up to his father's expectations.My two main complaints with the film are minor ones, but still kept it from being a 9. The first I have already mentioned, the first hour was herky jerky, never seeming to find a steady groove. This was resolved by the last hour and it gave us a much improved upon 3rd act, one of the flaws that the first film had in that the 3rd act was entertaining, but lacked a grand finale feel. My other complaint is the score. I absolutely loved the score for the first film. The mix of guitar and drum interwoven with string and horns made for a score that felt at home with a move titled Iron Man. This go around, no such guitar or drum woven score. The ""theme"" from the first film isn't even used again, a minor complaint, but one that took me out of the film a little as the first score really worked well and is sorely missed here. Composer Ryeland Allison and original music by Ramin Djawadi gave us an excellent score in the first. This go around they are replaced by John Debney who gives us a lackluster score.Lastly on the music front, don't believe the hype about the Iron Man 2 soundtrack, which purports to be nothing but AC/DC. There are only 2 songs by AC/DC in the entire film. So not sure why the soundtrack CD, which has 15 songs by AC/DC, is being purported as being the soundtrack, which it is not. Again, a slight critique, but something fans should know going in.My complaints are minimal, the film delivers on exactly what it should and it brings forth a start, of what looks to be a very fun and exciting summer full of theater entertainment. Oh yeah, one final thing, DO NOT GET UP AND LEAVE BEFORE THE END CREDITS. Wait them out, you will be pleasantly surprised, especially if you are a Marvel/Avengers fan.","

"piratecannon","29 December 2012","Iron Man 2 is not The Dark Knight. And it shouldn't be.For my money, I can't think of a movie that better embodies the term ""popcorn flick."" Like its predecessor, this one is all about fun. There are rock 'em sock 'em explosions aplenty, as well as some slickly filmed fight sequences that are quite memorable (but, honestly, aren't earth-shattering when compared to any number of other uber-energetic comic book films of the last decade). Don't be fooled, though; this sequel to the 2008 hit actually builds on the mythos of Tony Stark in some welcome ways.Front and center in this particular feature is ""the past""—that is, it's very much focused on Howard Stark (Tony's father) and his vision of a futuristic society that thrives on the energy derived from his Arc Reactor. There are also some other juicy tidbits we learn about Stark Sr., not the smallest of which has a little something to do with rewriting the periodic table. Also thrown into the mix is a physicist who worked with Howard back in the day. He's a disgruntled Russian who feels he's been slighted because—among other things—of Tony's success. He's got a son of his own named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), and he's determined to avenge his father's legacy at all costs. Yes, the plot is driven by a stereotypical variation on the revenge story we're all familiar with, but, given the already superficial nature of the film (which, let's be honest, we all expected), it works well.Iron Man 2, quite simply, does everything a competent sequel should. In this case, it further highlights the flaws of its protagonist, and it builds on the comedy/action pairing that made the original film so successful. It even ties in new characters—such as Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff—who are fairly interesting in their own right while settting itself up for a third film that will (hopefully) continue the trend.Despite all its upward momentum, Iron Man 2 does falter from time to time. As is the case with many-a-movie, our hero solves seemingly impossible ""puzzles"" in record time (here, we're talking about scientific enigmas that can only be deciphered with the use of improvised proton accelerators). This directly correlates with a looming sense of danger—developed by a specific plot element that I won't ruin here—that's established early in the film, and, because of this ridiculously absurd ""quick fix,"" said surprisingly tangible sense of dread is undercut in an extraordinarily premature manner.But, again, what did you expect? This is Iron Man 2, not the philosophical diatribe of a makeup wearing psychopath. As tired as I am of this clichéd phrase, it still applies: ""It is what it is."" Because of that, there should be zero complaints.","

"barbagvido","27 June 2016","Whenever someone mentions Iron Man 2, they usually call it bad or say something bad about it. But I think it was actually pretty good and I had so much fun. I guarantee, you won't be bored for a second.It wasn't better than the first Iron Man, but it was better than The Incredible Hulk. It's lighter than The Incredible Hulk, but darker than Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. shines again in the leading role and this time we is developed a lot more than in the first one. In the first one, he is shown as this cool, funny scientist who becomes a superhero, but what I liked here the most is that we get to see that he is no more than just another ordinary human with his own personal conflicts. We get to see who Tony Stark really is. This movie also brings us some new faces: Scarlett Johansson as a super-cool female hero Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as one out of the two villains is really annoying but that's probably the way his character is supposed to be so I don't blame him, with the other villain being played by Mickey Rourke. And why Rourke was decent, he was just that typical Russian villain you see in many Hollywood movies. And also, Terrence Howard was recast and Don Cheadle got his role and I can say that Cheadle may even be a bit better. Some people say that a big problem of this movie is that it's setting up MCU too much. But if you ask me, that kinda had to happen eventually and they made it fit with the plot so it isn't all over the place.Overall, this movie was very entertaining and it's also probably the best of the ""weaker"" MCU movies so far.","

"mombot","4 June 2010","First off, I'll admit I'm not a big fan of either the comics or the first film. However, director John Faverau really did make this enjoyable for us ""non-geeks"" as well as the ""geeks"". Decent story and interactions with Tony and Pepper were enjoyable. I think the weakest writing was for the Scarlett Johnannsen character, but her acting was good in spite of that. The main attraction for me, even though I'm a fan of Robert Downey Jr., was Mickey Rourke and he did not disappoint. He's the best thing about this film when he's in a scene. Not the anyone else is a slouch, but I'm glad Mickey is back in films. I will add that I can't picture anyone else playing Tony Stark, though. Very impressed with the CGI and other special effects. I don't recall as much humor or banter between the characters in the first, but thought it was appropriate (in IM2)and kept the film's tone lighter. Best summer film so far.

It would be best to watch the first film to know what happened. There are some things that just wont make sense if you haven't seen the first film yet. Children can watch this movie pretty much at any age. But please parents make sure that your children can watch this type of action pack movie. This movie is at least 8 out of 10 stars. There is a lot of action within the movie. To me this movie is on that list of movies that can be watched multiple times within the year or even years. I'm going to be watching this movie plus all the other Marvel movies in a marathon.","

"TourettesPersonal","10 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is not as good as the first movie. This movie has many plots and dialogue, and there were only have few action scenes. It is still entertaining and it didn't ended up like Transformers 2(why did i compare TF2 anyway?). I love to give this movie a perfect score but it's disappointing.Iron Man 2 wasn't a bad film it's just disappointing because it's not that action pack. It has only 3 or 4 action scenes, and 2 of them were long and the rest didn't last a minute. By the way the first movie only had 3 fights and those 3 were long. Good thing the finale in Iron Man 2 is more awesome and has more explosion than the first Iron Man's finale. The music score of the first Iron Man movie was better. The cast is entertaining. Robert Downey Jr. is still awesome. Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell are entertaining villains. Scarlett Johansson is hot and sexy as Natalia, but she's hotter as Black Widow(The name Black Widow and Whiplash was never mentioned throughout the movie). The director of this movie Jon Favreau is fun to watch as Hogan. The only problem in the cast is Don Cheadles. He's not playing Jim Rhodes, he's just playing his old roles.Iron Man 2 is still a superhero and the point of every superhero movie is the action but here in Iron Man 2 the action scenes were few. The movie has too much dialogue and plots, and few action. It's not a successful sequel but it's a fun movie to watch this summer. Iron Man 1 is still a classic superhero movie!","

"gritfrombray-1","2 May 2010","I have to laugh at the amount of obviously stupid people who ran this film down and only went to it to find something wrong. I really enjoyed the first installment and it was the best kick off Marvel film to date but it presented an all too 'obviously going to be the bad guy' Stane. But little else to complain about. This film portrayed an unstable Stark played by the masterful Downey and showed his battles with drink, technology and public life in a real watchable fashion. Pepper Potts was wonderful and, as always Paltrow delivers a fine performance. Mickey Rourke was spine shiveringly amazing in his portrayal as Whiplash and was secretly deceptive in his intentions and abilities. Justin Hammer provides comic support too. Terrence Howard is forgotten in the blink of an eye and Cheadle is even better as Rhodie. The whole arms race and the military row over the Iron Man weapon is a great story and there is slow points in the middle of the film but when watched in full it's obvious that the entire film cannot be in fast forward. Nick Fury and Black Widow are played in superb form by Jackson and Johansson, providing blistering support and many surprises. The showdown at end is as always fantastic. The dialogue and action are all in true comic book style and I for one am looking forward to many more like this to come!","

"gregyolen","27 April 2010","Summer blockbuster season always brings with it at least one big disappointment. This year's comes right up front – and what a disappointment it is. IRON MAN 2 is a classic sequel in the worst sense: we've got more villains, more heroes, more money in the budget, and none of it amounts to an experience that comes even close to that of its predecessor, which stood out in 2008 as smart, effervescent counter-programming in the summer dominated by the dour DARK KNIGHT.The problems with IRON MAN 2 are bone deep, but they manifest themselves everywhere on the surface. While the first film focused neatly on Tony and his development from careless cad to honorable hero, this sequel gives him nowhere to go, and at some point in the filming/editing, director Jon Favreau must have realized this; hence, his new movie's many secondary characters and subplots receive a disproportionate share of screen time here. Tony is all but discarded as a dynamic character – and it becomes very clear very early that without the original's central arc (and I ain't talking arc reactor, hiyo,) there's really not much novel about this franchise.","

"oslai1998","30 April 2010","So, i got to catch the film yesterday night and i thought it was truly amazing and magnificent , i am planning it to watch it again but the film was truly remarkable , i mean . The film surely passes it's pressedor. But i thought the last scene battling Whiplash was short. Whiplash uses his electrical string and just flipped it to Iron Man and War Machine, then they used their hand power and blast it in each other making Whiplash die. Acting was nice, visual and actions and good. The action was actually better than the first one quite a lot. But the bad thing that the movie was so short. Around 126=2 hours 6 minutes long. If it was around 130 minutes, it would be betterSo now i gave you my review, i would give this movie a 10.10 I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves Iron Man. If you watch it, Make sure you watch the scene after the credits about Mojab, Thor's Hammer.","

Sadly this effort just didn't live up to expectations.That is not to say the movie is terrible or boring but it just missed something.Downey Jr, Rourke, Rockwell, Paltrow and Johansson performing together should have added up to something great but unfortunately it just added up to something that was OK.Hard to identify a single flaw but I got the impression that the film makers started off with a project that was just too ambitious (a cynic might describe it as a project that was too poorly defined).Some of the plot leaps, clunky dialogue and vanishing characters made me think a lot of material had been cut and gaps had been filled with hasty re-shoots.Go and see this by all means. You will probably enjoy it but it really could have been so much more enjoyable.","

In a large proportion of time almost nothing happens or if it happens it is not so important even the villains seem to have a break from everything else to do nothing, everything becomes very slow and I felt like I was watching a Tony Stark's typical day. It also has good moments, as I said the beginning and the end, but I can't get over the fact that I almost fell asleep in the middle. I still like the cast and the introduction of Black Widow was well received, but I can still say that Iron Man 2 is one of the most boring Marvel movies.","

"ohroonoko","15 December 2021","Originally scored this a 5 (five!) when I watched this 11 years ago. I don't know why I was so harsh on it, I think it had a lot to do with not liking Mickey Rourke as the villain with his electric whips, or the army of drones that were too similar to Iron Man's suit, or even Sam Rockwell as an antagonist. For sure I was deeply disappointed (and to some degree still am) that Terrence Howard was replaced as Rhodes- but I appreciate Don Cheadle's take on the role. Maybe my expectations were just too high and I wanted a grittier follow up to Iron Man. Whatever the case may be, I just watched it again for the first time in 11 years (as I am watching all the MCU films in MCU timeline order) and I really enjoyed this film. The character development, the character interaction, the introduction of Black Widow, the early Nick Fury appearance, the humor... all in retrospect, this is actually a pretty good installment. And after I watched the deleted and alternate scenes, I got a great appreciation for the editor and director for leaving those scenes on the cutting room floor- it was a good call because those scenes would have negatively impacted the pacing, or been over the top with the corniness.","

"razvan9310","24 May 2010","What makes this second part of the Iron Man live story better is that it sticks to the genuine comic books characters. Tony Stark is way more narcissistic and self-centered than in the previous movie, which is, in my opinion, much more accurate and enjoyable, at least for the Iron Man fans. Also, great secondary characters: well-playing Sam Rockwell and gorgeous Scarlett Johansson. Enjoyable action and promising after-credits ending. Heck, AC/DC music, too! I gave this movie 8 out of 10, for being a comic books and IM fan, but any SF, Action and why not Drama consumer would surely enjoy it.

"mjplysaght","3 February 2017","OK, so this film is considered by a bunch of people to be completely terrible, and while I can agree that there are a bunch of flaws, I wouldn't define this film as god-awful.A lot of things are thrown into the mix only to be resolved by some sort of deus ex machina. To put it short, this is just filler leading up to The Avengers.Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect fit for Tony Stark. He proved himself in the original Iron Man and here, while this film isn't quite as good as the first, he still carries the charm with him, even if Stark is caught in a battle of his own self-destruction.Sam Rockwell plays a tenacious, awkward and irritating rival to Stark in the form of Justin Hammer, another weapons developer, who tries to team up with Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, the son of Howard Stark's business partner(?) whose revenge stems from the Stark family taking credit for the creation of the arc reactor while his family is forgotten about? It's not developed enough.Meanwhile, Tony Stark needs to find a suitable replacement element for his Arc Reactor as the palladium core is slowly killing him. As well as that, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is shoehorned into the film, merely just to establish her presence in the Avengers, rather than HER OWN FILM, which even at the time of writing this, seven years after the film's release, there still aren't any concrete plans.The film is full of red herrings and subplots that get resolves so quickly, that it really makes you ask what was the point of including it in the film to begin with. Also, the action is very short-lived.Putting all that aside, it's cool to see Robert Downey Jr. just be himself as Tony Stark. Full of confidence and charisma that it seems completely effortless.","

"TheCasualReviewer","20 May 2020","SYNOPSIS:
The word is out, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is Iron Man and everyone wants a piece of the technology. Unfortunately, Stark isn't the only one capable of building a suit and the others who can, aren't who you want replicating it.REVIEW:
The thing with MCU films is there are always redeemable factors (possibly other than Dark World I've been trying to avoid that for years). The first 30 minutes of this film I love. After that, it starts to go downhill a bit. It doesn't completely go off the rails, but it starts to focus far more on the health of Stark and how the piece in his chest is killing him. Now, I wasn't hating the movie during the middle, but especially when compared to the first film, there was a lot less going on and it didn't keep the same pace that the other films do and to me, it didn't have a good final battle. I honestly felt that Stark had more trouble on the race course (which is one of the best scenes in the MCU) than he had at the end. Granted he had help, but it also ended very soon and there didn't seem to be any real threat to his life displayed in the film. There was more of a threat coming from his chest throughout the film. I know it wasn't the fault of the studio and I like Don Cheadle, but I feel Terrence Howard was a better Rhodey and was more believable in that part. The film wasn't terrible, but wasn't one of the best. I still did enjoy aspects, such as the direction from Favreau, the addition of Agent Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and I loved Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, but I will find myself revisiting the other films far more than this one. 6.5/10.","

A perfect blend of a good story line, good acting, action and a touch of humor. Robert Downey Jr is even better in this film.I think after the first film he has just perfected the part of Tony Stark. Don Cheadle as Rhodey was brilliant. I originally did not know what to think when I heard Mickey Rourke would be playing the villain in Iron-Man 2, so i was really happy when he pulled of a stellar performance as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. There were plenty of characters which is good to see in a film, many films have to little characters, but in this film there is many in Tony, Rhodey, Pepper, Nick Fury, Natasha, Whiplash and Justin Hammer. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was amazing but when you think about it what role doesn't Samuel L. play well.","

"bowakawa","30 April 2010","The original Iron Man is obviously a hard act to follow; but surprisingly Iron Man 2, just about pulls it off! It revolves around the star ego of Tony Stark, playboy millionaire by day, action hero by night; although this time around he is no longer prone to hiding his identity because he revealed it to the public. This sparks controversy, shocks and outcry through the US government.The acting is superb, Whiplash is very intriguing, when he is actually in it; mostly revolving around his real identity- Ivan Vanko. Robert Downey Jr also delivers a stellar performance as Stark, who's device is not only saving him but killing him also.The special effects are amazing whether it is chopping race-cars in two or Iron Man fighting corrupted robots next to war machine, it is sure to be one of the best visually of the yearOverall, you're in for one hell of a ride, i would give it a seven and a half but it is closer to an eight.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","10 May 2010","Ah, summer blockbuster 2010 has started, and what bigger bang than with the sequel to 2008's smash hit, Iron Man? I really did enjoy the first Iron Man, it was exciting, action packed and different from other super hero movies that we see. Most super hero's hide themselves and stay very introverted in their ""normal human"" disguise, but Tony Stark was something different, he was so alive and colorful and admits pretty much off the bat to the world that he is Iron Man. Naturally he is going to get a lot of challengers in the world and we love to see him take them on as he knows how hot he is and doesn't hide it. So Iron Man 2 is the sequel that everyone who loved the first Iron Man had to see. I admit that I was extremely excited, this looked even better than the first Iron Man. So I got to see it this weekend and I have to say that my friends and I were a little disappointed. Not to say this is a bad movie by any means, it's a good one and very much worth the theater experience, but it didn't have the same ""pazazz"" as the other Iron Man had. Usually most sequels have this part of having to explain the characters, go a little more in depth with them, Iron Man 2 is no stranger to this. Now it can either be good or bad, in this case, Iron Man 2 fell a little short and started to bore me; but it does come back for an awesome ending.Six months after revealing his identity as Iron Man, Tony Stark, has helped maintain world peace. A United States Senate committee, led by Senator Stern, demands Stark release the technology for military application. Stark refuses, declaring that he and the suit are as one while also claiming his competitors are years away from successfully recreating the technology. Afraid of a possible doom he's facing, he appoints his former personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, replacing her with Natalie Rushman. While racing in Monaco, Stark is attacked by Ivan Vanko, who has constructed an arc reactor of his own, along with whip-like energy weapons. Stark defeats Vanko. Afterward, Stark learns that Vanko is the son of his father's old partner. Ivan blames the Starks for his family's poor fate, and seeks revenge. Rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer has Vanko broken out of jail and recruits him to perfect a line of armored combat units he will use to upstage Stark at his own Expo.Mickey Rourke over all does his job well as the main villain of the story, but my only problem is that a lot of his lines I couldn't understand. He has a thick Russian accent that over does it a little too much because I kept leaning over and asking my friends ""what did he say"" and they would respond with ""I have no idea"". Trying to be as intimidating as Ivan Drako in Rocky IV(heck, even their last names look alike) it didn't work as well. Scarlett Johansson was a little dull at first but once again comes back with a vengeance in the end as she has possibly the coolest fight scene in the film. Robert Downey, Jr. as usual does a great job, my only problem being once again, in the first Iron Man, he was confident and smooth, this one he was more cocky and a jerk. I couldn't root for him as much with this sequel. But Iron Man 2 still delivers in the action, the effects are just as cool and really keep you on the edge of the seat. There are some good laughs and over all a decent enough story, it just could have used a little more sparkle I think. But I'm satisfied with Iron Man 2, it gives the audience what it wants and doesn't hold back on the action.6/10","

"doorsscorpywag","14 September 2010","Iron Man is a better song than movie franchise. Basically he is a rich guy in a metal suit who gets his ass kicked by the villains and manages to do something sneaky at the end to win. He got his ass kicked in the 1st and he gets his ass kicked in the 2nd. The guy is a loser. He even needed help to win sneaky in this one. In between getting his ass kicked he does some really boring stuff like inventing a new element to save his life and talking to some bloke who was a pirate. The main villain must have stole the pirates parrot at some point in the movie but my attention wandered to a fly crawling up the wall which was more interesting so I am not sure when. The ending sequence stolen from Predator and Terminator was dull and boring and the money spent could have been spent better with perhaps employing someone who knew what the hell they were doing. Nursery school children could come up with a better film than this turd of a movie. None of it made any sense and the actors seemed as bored as I was delivering stupid lines with a look of someone who had just wandered into a a lift after someone else coming out had farted. Some of these people were actually actors once. Gwen Paltry not among them of course. Sad to see them wasting their time with this rubbish.","

"freewillyfan","2 November 2019","Iron Man 2 is a decent follow up to the first. The cast is great again and there are some fun action scenes. The race scene and the final fight are quite good. Unfortunately there are multiple plots that make the film feel a little messy and the stories just aren't as interesting as the first movie's. We get an introduction to Black Widow in this which is great. Overall there's fun to be had but nothing amazing about this film and it doesn't have the same freshness as the first.6.7/10","

"AD70","30 April 2010","If you like movies with more action and less time being wasted in developing a back-story and detailed character build-ups then this movie is definitely for you.Fans of the comics will probably enjoy the movie more than those of us who are not already familiar with the new set of characters. But things fall into place as the movie develops so it doesn't take away too much from the overall enjoyment.The actors are all pretty good, Mickey Rourke does very well and so does Scarlet Johansson. Don Cheadle seems a little out of place in the beginning (not because of his acting, more because I really liked Terrence Howard in the first film) but as the movie develops he starts fitting the role much better. By the end of the film I didn't miss Terrence so much. Samuel L Jackson could have done with some more screen time, but I feel that they are developing him for the next installment in the franchise.Overall, the film was still Great! With a mix of the humor and fantastic special effects that made the first film so good.Go watch this movie with an open mind, expecting lots of action, some good moments of humor (there were lots of ladies sitting near and around us laughing out loud at many parts of the film so they obviously found it to be pretty good, as did the guys).Everyone's going to be talking about Iron Man 2 and everyone will have their opinions about what they liked or disliked about it (compared to the first installment). Don't miss out, watch Iron Man 2, it will not be a waste of time or money, and join-in on the discussions!","

"vikascoder","8 May 2010","I would not say that I had very high hopes riding on this one when I entered the theater, but i was looking for a fun movie to watch on a Friday night. But it was not to be and I walked out of the theater tired, irritated and drained out to the core.The first Ironman was a pretty picture: concise, great build up and action and clear humorous dialogs. Ironman 2 is a mess and looking from the current reviews and rating, a highly overrated one too. Things which did not work for me:1. Such absolutely brain numbing chatter between the characters! Was there any script for the lines? 2. Poor characterization, poor chemistry between the leads 3. Poor production quality: Yes! poor! Scarlett's fight sequence in the building was one of the most laughably staged ones in recent memory 4. Absence of a compelling plot: Well i do not expect every movie to be the Dark Knight, but hey at least you can put a semblance of a non- derivative plot?Mind numbing junk","

"dakotadickenson-83457","9 April 2023","Iron Man 2 is definitely one of the most underrated sequels of the MCU. Robert Downey Jr returns once again as Tony Stark/Iron Man after revealing to the world that he is Iron Man, Tony must face new challenges such as the government thinking his suit is a dangerous weapon and wanting him to hand it over, finding a new replacement for the palladium core in his arc reactor that's keeping him alive while also poisoning him, and fighting a new enemy that ties into his family's legacy. Mickey Rourke stars as the villain Ivan Vanko/Whipflash and I highly think his villain definitely doesn't get the credit he deserves. The only problem I really have with his villain is the accent doesn't always hit its mark and he only has a couple of scenes of actual action that doesn't last long at all. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts too as the new CEO of Stark Industries. Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Rhodey and now I can't imagine anybody, other than Don Cheadle portraying the character. The film also gives us a proper introduction to Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury who is the the Director of Shield and Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Overall, Iron Man 2 isn't as great as it's predecessor, but it is a more than solid sequel that gives us plenty to be entertained by. Rating 7.5/10.","

"aurora_vampiris","22 May 2010","The thing with Iron Man 2 is that people inevitably tend to compare it to the first movie. And there's a minor problem with that. Iron Man - in most regions - released at just the right time. People were downright disappointed with the superhero genre and it appeared to be on the brink of demise after Spider-Man 3 and the X-Men films. Batman Begins seemed to have made a mark, but it was too fleeting and insignificant to be etched in people's memories. Then came Iron Man - it was the first decent superhero movie in ages. People loved it, it spread to engulf the Box Office earnings and bingo - there was a new, awesome superhero in town. Of course, after Iron Man, there was this little film you may have heard of - it was titled ""The Dark Knight."" THAT took the box office by storm. Iron Man, fortunately enough for the franchise, got bunched together with the Dark Knight and came to be fondly remembered as an audience favourite. Unfortunately, the audience has a very short memory span and tends to prize fond memories on some untouchable pedestal in their minds - high above the rest of the ordinary movies that plague our cinemas today. Even if the details of the memory itself are scrubbed out. We still prize that blurred memory and cherish it.Iron Man was not a masterpiece. It was the first brilliant superhero movie in ages, but it was by no means a masterpiece a la The Dark Knight. It built up Tony Stark's character arc brilliantly but it got fairly anemic towards the middle and the action was all limited to the last ten minutes of the movie. Also, apart from Robert Downey Jr, little else stood out in the background. However, comparisons with the Dark Knight are not quite fair. The Dark Knight was a dark, brooding work of art that plants itself firmly in the noir superhero genre. Iron Man, however, is a light- hearted fun superhero movie - literally at the opposite end of the comic-book spectrum. So I shall compare it against the masterpiece (IMO) from the lighter side of the superhero niche - Spider-Man 2.Iron Man 2, ultimately, shares the same fate as its predecessor. It's a solid movie, surpassing the original movie and at times has flashes of greatness, but falls short of the spark that made Spider-Man 2 so great - conflict. Be it Peter Parker's frustration with having to maintain the secrecy of his superhero identity or his sorrow at the loss of Mary Jane Watson, the conflict was what made the story interesting. On the other hand, in Iron Man 2, Tony Stark seems to breeze through his problems by virtue of his sheer awesomeness. Best friend stole my armour? No problem. I'm still awesome enough. I can beat him... eventually. Some maniac managed to recreate my armour, re-programmed all of the US Army's Droid Army? Oh well, looks like I'll have to destroy them with my awesome, awesome armour-driving skills.Don't get me wrong here. Robert Downey Jr is still the most... well... awesome pick to play Iron Man. The fact is Robert Downey Jr IS the main strength of the entire film - his interaction with other characters is what lifts the film and gives it wings. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic. His kinsmanship with Don Cheadle is sufficient enough to pass muster - they look like two friends who've recently exchanged some harsh words, which is as it should be. In short, Robert Downey Jr seems to have made the role his own. He is Iron Man. The suit and him are truly one.The supporting cast is top-notch as well. Samuel L Jackson just raised Nick Fury's bar on my Marvel meter of awesomeness. Scarlett Johanssen seems to have fit into the Black Widow role like a glove. She looks quite fetching in latex and her stunt scenes are very well choreographed. Her physicality is realistic, especially where she punches through an entire goon squad in a corridoor in front of Tony Stark's flustered bodyguard. Comic book fans might be a bit disappointed with her American accent, but then again, Natasha Romanov IS a super-spy fluent in several different languages - it makes sense that she's a bit more discreet in the movie. Mickey Rourke is believable as Ivan Vanko (Whiplash) and seems menacing at the best of times. Jon Favreau is delightful as Happy, Tony Stark's happy-go-lucky bodyguard.But the actor who truly challenged Iron Man in his own movie was unquestionably Sam Rockwell. He was a revelation in Moon, and is a delight to watch here too - his flustered evil corporate honcho act is a stellar performance and seems to be more of a villain than Whiplash himself.The Iron Man armour(s) look amazing and the CGI is brilliant too. In short, the second movie delivers as much as the first... and more.PS: Watch out for the Easter Egg at the end of the movie credits. There's only one word that can describe the awesomeness of that scene, at least for a Marvel comics fan - Mjolnir.","

"skullislandsurferdotcom","15 February 2011","Although it's intriguing watching Robert Downey Jr. as millionaire Tony Stark who, with too much fame, money, booze and girls, behaves like Downey did in the nineties (short of waking up in a stranger's living room), this is an action film lacking action.Mickey Rourke makes for a potentially decent villain, but is given two (relatively quick) scenes battling our hero, the metal clad warrior not up for saving the world (but from what, or who?).The lack of a decent heavy is replaced by Sam Rockwell's sleazy arms-dealing senator, given too much dialog in scenes that need more punch.Much like ROCKY IV... a lazy ""champion"" with too much money verses a killer Russian... but even that had more vapidly entertaining comic book appeal, something this needed more of.","

"flapdoodle64","25 May 2010","This is a fine comic book movie that relies as much on snappy dialogue and characters as it does fight scenes and CGI. IMO, this is a good idea in that with regard to FX and CGI, we have reached the age of overkill.Another interesting departure from modern superhero films: typically such films increase the number of supervillians with each sequel, i.e., Spidey 3 and Batman Forever having 3 supervillians. But no, Favreau wisely chooses to have 1 supervillian here.Finally, Iron Man diverges from current trends in that he heavily relies, even depends, on his supporting cast. Rhodie, Pepper, and Happy all contribute heavily to Our Hero's eventual triumph. I find this refreshing when I contrast it with the monomania of certain popular heroes. Also, unlike Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, there is no attempt to make Iron Man 2 more overpowering, bombastic, mindnumbing and pretentious than Iron Man 1. No, the attempt is simply to make a movie that is true to the characters and scenario of Iron Man 1, and to make the movie fun, interesting, and exciting. In this way perhaps the Iron Man franchise will be like the James Bond franchise, making each film simply another chapter in the life of our hero, rather than trying to make each film a quantum leap in intensity over the previous.And even though Iron Man 2 does not smack you upside the head every 3 minutes trying to tell you how 'deep' and 'meaningful' it is, there is a genuine socio-political subtext to this film that is plain to see if anyone cares to look. The final message is ambiguous and open-ended, but if one follows the threads regarding the interaction between weapons, money and politics, Iron Man 2 is understatedly subversive.","

"ivo-cobra8","21 October 2015","Iron Man 2 (2010) is not a great sequel to an original superhero Action films from 2008 portrayed on a comic books of Jon Favreau's Iron Man film from 2008. This film still delivers and is not that bad either. It is a good Action comic book superhero film but it is a lackluster sequel film. I am sorry Iron Man fans but it try's to be a good film, but it fails in some points. Robert Downey Jr. gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story. The general excellence of the casting trumps the inarguable excellence of the technology. This is a forgettable follow up to Iron Man and falls short on Part I in every way from its awful plot to its short action sequences, it is an awful movie but in some was it is still a good film. Iron Man 2 was a HUGE disappointment, it's the worst movie out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in my opinion and this sequel is rushed out. Iron Man 2 has lot's of problems I thought the last half got torn apart like it does.The best scenes are still the ones with Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Stark's charm-resistant assistant, Pepper Potts), or just Downey alone. The rest feels like padding, which is something a sleek-suited superhero shouldn't need. Not only that This film was rushed out and it was really too long. This film shouldn't have Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) in it, making a prequel in it. Terrence Howard been replaced by Don Cheadle. Tony acting like a jerk again. On his birthday party been all drunk in an Iron Man Suit, not caring about his company beside Pepper. Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes stealing his suit and getting in to a fight with Tony was the worst idea and scene ever. Than they building weapons in the armor ""War Machine"" that JUST WASN'T RIGHT. This film isn't the best portraying film ever by a comic book, which the original is way better than this film is. Natasha Romanoff lying and spying on Tony was wrong and judging Tony was wrong. Romanoff beats all Justin Hamme's bodyguards while Happy fights in a boxing fight with one bodyguard and barely beats him. While Natasha Romanoff is John Rambo one woman army, kills everyone. Come on guys she knows martial arts but she is not a super invincible woman. She is a human been vulnerable like me and you. In my opinion she stole Iron Man's scenes, Tony should have saved Pepper again and stop the bad guys alone. He had a help ""War Machine ""on the end of the film. I still prefer Iron Man (2008) to this film, sorry. Lame one liners, non stop explosions but no one ever gets hurt (especially not the innocent civilians), and a very predictable story line makes for a dull movie. Iron Man 2 with a lot of problems isn't the worst sequel and it isn't bad at all. It does have scene ways that turn's in to good. It has a good things too in it. Iron Man showed the world just how much energy, rhythm, humor, sincerity, and quality filmmaking and storytelling could be crammed into a Superhero movie that managed to satisfy both longtime series fans and newcomers in search not of the perfect comic book adaptation but merely a well-crafted Summer blockbuster that delivered the goods without sacrificing story. I like Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash I thought he did a perfect job portraying a super villain and arch enemy of Iron Man in this film! Which I personally, think he did a better acting than the rest of the crew did. He is a professional and he can act the way he was told too. The fights between Iron Man and Whiplash on the track race were cool. I really love that. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is a combination of Iron Man's enemy the Crimson Dynamo (Dr Vanko, who wears weaponry/armour that can control electricity) and the supervillain Whiplash (who possesses a specially-designed razor/acid whip). That was awesome of making one of the most memorable super villains portraying by comic book even if it does have a little changes it is still good.I love the songs portrayed by AC/DC, the scores of the soundtrack a perfect to film. Even tough the film was not that good, I still did enjoyed in some scenes. Awesome cast, overpowering budget, & state of the art technology could do so much more, but by looking at the other reviews I'm certainly in the minority. The fights on the end of the film with CGI battling Iron Man with War Machine and successfully destroying the drones were terrific and I enjoyed with that. But that was all.Tough It was a A disappointing sequel and a disaster film I still like it and It was on a way still a good film, but the original was the best. I will still watch watch this film, even though it is a little let down but still watchable. Iron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.7/10 Score: C Studio : Marvel Studios, Paramount Pictures Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L.

"aid_h6","5 May 2010","Just going to get this out of the way. Iron Man 2 does not exceed it's predecessor in any way. The plot is beyond predictable, the acting is great with solid performances coming from all of the leads, and the special effects are good.The plot is simple enough. Jon Favreau clearly played it safe, which at least is better then the disaster that Spider-Man 3 was, but everyone was expecting much more from him this time around. The motivations for almost all the characters don't really make sense (I'm looking at Ivan Yenko and Rhodey here), but it still is enough to move the plot forward at a fairly brisk pace.Unfortuneatly this movie seemed pretty determined to show off all the new gizmos and gadgets Tony had developed in the slight time period between the two movies. As cool as it may have been, that ""oooh ahhh"" effect does not carry a movie.The acting was great, with an absolutely amazing cast giving exceptional performances. Don Cheadle did a great job taking over for Terence Howard, Robert Downey Jr was as amazing as usual and Mickey Rourke was a perfect choice for the antagonist.Strangely enough, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L Jackson had absolutely tiny roles in the movie, more serving as part of a prelude to ""The Avengers"". Why they felt they needed to blow their budget on some big name actors/actresses that they hardly used over a bolder writer I don't know.The effects were good, but still nothing special. I thought they nailed Whiplash (Thank god they avoided the leather outfit that was seen in the comic books), and some of the better action scenes had some great destruction, which we all love of course.If you REALLY liked Iron Man 1, you will like this. If you thought the first was okay, then this is probably a renter for you. Overall this was a passive move by marvel entertainment after a few hits (by the way could you please make another hulk movie?).Oh well, don't come expecting too too much.7/10","

"tareqzaghal","2 September 2023","When you grow up on the internet, sometimes you have opinions that aren't entirely yours on films you've only vaguely seen as a kid on TV. Years later, you can properly form more concise opinions, and in the case of Iron Man 2 (2010), you are all wrong.Way way way too hated on and overlooked, Maybe it's because of how terrible the Phase 4 films are, but this film is much better than I remember and what people think of it. No, it doesn't concern itself with the future of the cinematic universe more than its main story as people argue, things are organically woven into the expansion that a sequel must present. The history of Howard Stark, Nick Fury, Natasha Romanov, and S. H. I. E. L. D., all feel like natural aspects of the greater world Stark has stepped into.RDJ is still unquestionably the leading force behind these films, he is as charismatic as ever. Don Cheadle is a great recast and much better than Terrance Howard as Rhodey, who didn't possess the chemistry that they needed in this film. Rockwell is underrated as Justin Hammer and needs to come back to the MCU in the Armor Wars show. Rourke is okay as Whiplash, not that interesting but has a cool entrance, the film does shoehorn him a bit too much into the final fight by the end of it with not much necessity.Although it started off really well, especially with the entire Grand Prix sequence, the pacing does fall a bit short after the second act, and the entire last half of this film and the previous one are both much weaker compared to the first half. The suits are well-designed, the action is good, the CGI is still great and holds up.Maybe for some, this film doesn't offer anything new, and that's okay. For me, how the themes of fatherhood and legacy are introduced and emphasised in this film adds greatly to Tony's character development throughout the Infinity Saga. I understand the criticisms that the film faces in terms of boring villains and multiple unrelated storylines, but for me I felt like it was still able to build on Tony's arc and simultaneously expand the universe, and an overall great watch.","

"MovieMaster_2000","29 April 2010","Once again Tony Stark is back with his Narcissist behavior. This movie was great from the beginning to the end. It is a great super hero popcorn flick, but it's not a great film. I thought that it was very entertaining and I love Tony Stark's personality. I think that Jon Favreau's Iron Man movie series is one of the greatest super hero movie series of all time. It has personality, unlike other super hero movies who try to be serious (And copy the dark knight that succeeded with being serious) but in the end fails because you can't take these kind of Super heroes serious.When they made this movie, they didn't try to make it serious, instead they made it funny and entertaining, like a superhero movie should be (Except Nolan's Batman series). This movie has it's flaws, but it's still great. This movie was as great as the first Iron Man, but this contained more action and I thought that Robert Downey JR and Mickey Rourke was Awesome. This movie is a must see!","

"ddelamaide","28 October 2010","It's to be expected that a movie based on a superhero comic book would have adolescent appeal, but in a period when even animated films have layers of meaning to draw in adult viewers, this sequel comes across as flat and boring for anyone not enamored of Robert Downey Jr.'s childish and self-indulgent portrayal of Tony Stark.I'll admit I couldn't watch it until the end, but the plot is so predictable I guarantee no one could spoil it for me. It's a shame really to see so much talent and money wasted on such thin gruel. The production values are obviously very high (worth four of the five stars in my rating).Downey, I'm coming to believe, has been overrated as an actor (Sherlock Holmes was also dreadful), but it's a shame to see Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansson squander their talents on adolescent pablum. I guess everybody has to make a living.Mickey Rourke is the only one who manages to endow his underwritten role with an enigmatic quality that makes him worth watching, but hardly enough to salvage this film. Enjoy it, kids.","

This is becoming more and more commercial with each day passing by. How many comic books characters are there? Will everyone get its own movie? I hope not, because Marvel has become stale. It shoves itself on the screen, with the story of some rich guy, army manufacturer, gone berserk and became a guinea pig. In the middle of all that, he crossed a bunch of people including a Russian guy. What? Again with the Russians. Just stop it already. If you can't find a decent villain then maybe you shouldn't make a script. Sure, it was fun like in the comic book during the cold war. I as a viewer don't need to pay to go and see it with my own child and answer him that Russians are bad, because they pointed a nuclear missile in our direction. I don't need to feel bad for my country's politics that led to that, and the picture that stayed in some OLD comic book.RD and Rourke are great actors, but this story could do a makeover.","

"SnoopyStyle","7 December 2013","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is back declaring that he has created world peace. The problem is that his arc reactor heart is killing him as fast as saving his life. And then there's Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) who is on a mission to avenge his father with superior arc technology.It's a good continuation sequel. I like Mickey Rourke as the new bad guy. He has the look and the menacing demeanor. I even like the accent. Sam Rockwell is normally a special actor, but his sleazy weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer feels very generic. And Garry Shandling is stupid as a Senator.Overall, it does feel a little bit bloat with the vast number of characters and the complicated history in this movie. There are a few characters they introduce that payoff in later movies. For example, Scarlett Johansson seems like nothing more than a simple T&A show. If not for the later movies, I would say she's a bad distraction.The fact is that it does two things all at once. It's Iron Man 2, but also pre-Avengers. And it does them both well enough. But like a ship with two masters, it can veer off at times. It could have been a great movie that is strictly Iron Man 2. But this is a good enough movie that advances both goals.","

I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!","

"poe426","15 May 2010","By far the best thing about IRON MAN TWO is Scarlett Johansson as The Black Widow: her cgi-enhanced fight scenes make this virtual movie virtually worth watching- but it's the lack of any genuine humor (the saving grace of IRON MAN ONE) that makes the running time seem to drag. Downey is capable enough, given what he's given to work with, but watching an addict playing a drunk is hardly my idea of a fun evening. Had the filmmakers opted to say something of substance about substance abuse, one might've been inclined to forgive them the shortcomings of the script (which are legion). Rourke's threadbare role (a reprise, of sorts, of his character in THE WRESTLER) adds not one whit of sheen to his shine: he not only looks like a homeless man, his persona screams it. A true waste.","

"leplatypus","19 May 2010","From a private point of view, this is our first ""family"" trip since ""Iron Man 1"" and if the first had been a honeymoon, this second is rather an Odysseus. What will happen with the third movie? From a comic fan, I have been hugely disappointed by this sequel.When they cast Rourke as villain, my expectations were low and the actual watching even in Imax didn't get them up. He may be OK for ""Sin City"" but not the marvel way. In addition, the choice for his character Whiplash is dumb because it's like directing a Robocop movie delivering tickets! When you want an amazing movie, you find an amazing bad guy: remember Dark Vador, Terminator or Green Goblin! Then I discovered the second villain: Hammer. Well, it's a crooked businessman so this isn't a choice for action. In addition, his cast is terrible because Sam Rockwell hasn't got any charisma and is always weening.Scarlett Johansson is a fine Black Widow but her involvement is mishandled.Sure, Robert Downey is still the perfect Tony Stark and there are some good moments (the movie with his father, the new armors) but I didn't find the fun I had two years ago! I think Mr. Theroux is a better actor than writer and that he should have stayed on Mulholland drive.In conclusion, it's Iron Man washed and void that you see and it will be the result as long as you give the screenplay to people who are not reading comics as hobbies. Adaptation = No filter!","

"babzey","1 May 2010","Call me biased if you will, because I admit I was completely taken with the first movie, but I absolutely loved this film. I went into it knowing I would enjoy it either way, but fully prepared to admit it if it wasn't good. There are a lot of people saying this was disappointing. Those people are everywhere, in every board, for every film. Pay them no mind, and I encourage you to go and see this film for yourself, make your own judgement. With amazing effects, and just the perfect balance between character development and action, this movie has it all. It picks up directly where the first one left off, and gives us everything we loved from the first film and then some. The suit got more advanced, the bad guys got badder, and the tension between Tony and Pepper went up a notch. Any loose strings from the first film are tied up nicely, and I'm happy to say that Stark is every bit as egotistical and brilliant as he was in Iron Man. As for Potts, while some complain about her, I really don't see the problem. Pepper is easily the most relatable character, not just in Iron Man, but in every superhero film, as far as female leads go. Comparisons should not influence your decision, because there is no film quite like this one out there, aside from the first installment. A firm ten out of ten from me.","

"Tweekums","9 May 2011","At the end of the first 'Iron Man' film Tony Stark announced to the world that he was Iron Man; I assumed that this would quickly be explained as a joke and he'd do back to being a standard superhero whose true identity is unknown I was wrong; this superhero wants the world to know who he is and he wants to enjoy his celebrity status. Not everything is going well for Tony though; the senate wants him to hand over his suit to the military and to make matters worse he is slowly dying. Tony is convinced that nobody else is close to developing a suit like his until one day he is attacked by Ivan Venko; a Russian with a grudge against the Stark family. Venko ends up working for a rival arms manufacturer, Justin Hammer, and Tony is approached by a shadowy individual who claims that there is a cure for Tony's condition but only Tony can find it. While Tony sets about finding that cure Hammer is creating a drone army, which ultimately Tony must confront.This was a fun sequel that sets things up nicely for a future superhero franchise; 'The Avengers'. There was lots of explosive action and some delightfully over the top acting from Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and a far more restrained performance as Pepper Potts, his erstwhile assistant now CEO of Stark Industries. Mickey Rourke was suitably menacing as Venko and Don Cheadle was good as Stark's friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes. Of the new characters the biggest surprise came from Scarlett Johansson who appeared to be a straight-laced lawyer but soon proved to be a martial arts expert who may be a superhero herself! Like the vast majority of modern action films this was full of CGI and special effects; thankfully they were well done and the CGI looked believable even when we were being shown the impossible. Overall this was a lot of fun and it is suitable for adults and older children alike.","

"zardoz-13","10 May 2010","""Iron Man 2"" ranks as a CGI-riddled, overblown, second-rate sequel. Director Jon Favreau's original Marvel super hero saga delivered a slam-bang, refreshing blend of superheroism and bad attitude on the part of its egotistical protagonist, and Jeff Bridges proved a worthy rival as his treacherous vice president who copied his high-tech armored suit and challenged to the death. While Favreau's ambitious sequel delivers more than enough exhilarating displays of pyrotechnic prowess, ""Iron Man 2"" is neither as nimble nor as engrossing as its spectacular predecessor. Indeed, Iron Man faces a new contender. Thuggish Ivan Vanko isn't as memorable as the sinister Obadiah Stane, but he does appropriate high moral ground as part of his crusade to topple our hero. Meantime, Robert Downey, Jr. is every bit as good as he was the first time around, and he tackles bigger problems in his encore in this follow-up adaptation of a popular comic-book series that came out in 1963. Unfortunately, ""Tropic Thunder"" scenarist Justin Theroux wraps everything up a predictable plot that presents a plethora of complications but few surprises. Some movies suffer from too many characters and too great an agenda. This is what cripples ""Iron Man 2."" The middle section of this 124-minute marathon buckles under the weight of excessive plotting and extra characters before the film recovers sufficiently for a triumphant ending. The action unfolds in chilly Moscow as destitute Soviet physicist Anton Vanko (Yevgeni Lazarev of ""Lord of War"") dies with his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke of ""Sin City""), at his side. While this is happening, the local news contains a broadcast of Tony Stark coming out of his metal closet to admit that he is Iron Man. Before the elder Vanko passes away, he assures his son that Ivan should have been in billionaire industrialist Tony Stark's shoes as Iron Man. As it turns out, Stark's late father Howard (John Slattery of ""Traffic"") and Anton were partners who collaborated on the invention of the arc reactor. Eventually, Anton was deported to the Soviet Union where he managed to scrape out an miserable livelihood. Ivan finds the blueprints that his father created with Howard Stark. He sets about to construct a primitive version of Iron Man's breastplate and adds two crackling fiber-optic whips that can slice through metal as if it were butter. Look out Tony Stark! If Ivan doesn't represent a minor threat in the overall scheme of things, Tony discovers that the very suit that enables him to carry out his vigilante crime fighting exploits is contaminating his blood and gradually killing him. In other words, our hero has got to find a new energy source that won't kill him. Meantime, a United States Senate Investigation committee, headed up by slimy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling of ""What Planet Are You From?""), insists that Stark hand over the technology of his Iron Man outfit to the government for military application. Naturally, Stark doesn't cooperate. He explains that the suit and he are one and that America need not fear anybody cloning his flying suit of armor.Bored with the routine of running his massive corporation, Tony promotes his right hand woman, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow of ""Great Expectations""), as the CEO of Stark Industries. Of course, Pepper is flabbergasted by this extravagant gesture on Tony's part. Our hero flies off to Monaco to race in the Grand Prix and runs into Ivan with his whips. Pepper and Tony's chauffeur Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau of ""Couples Retreat"") careen onto the race course and give our protagonist his suitcase version of his outfit. In no time at all, Iron Man emerges and defeats Ivan. Not long afterward, Tony's worst enemy--rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell of ""Moon"") -- breaks Vanko broken out of prison and cuts a bargain with him to clone Tony's Iron Man outfit. Ivan, however, is no flunky and he embarks on an entirely different program. Instead of replicating Iron Man's outfit, he masterminds an army of drones that Hammer wants to sell to the Pentagon. Stark stages the Stark Expo in Flushing Meadows, New York, to carry on his father's legacy. Anybody who creates a worthwhile contribution to technology can display their handiwork. Hammer unveils his drones, but learns too late that Ivan's infamous scheme supersedes his own plans. The chief problem with ""Iron Man 2"" is its lackluster villain. As Ivan Vanko, Rourke appears appropriately nefarious as a walking, talking tattoo with a grudge against our champion, but he poses only a disposable threat. Mind you, he looks menacing enough, but his lack of charisma is only matched by his absence of hygiene. Now, Ivan's outfit looks more interesting, but Iron Man turns it against him in no time as he does the drones. Basically, Ivan combines Iron Man's adversary the Crimson Dynamo and the super villain Whiplash. Sam Rockwell's buffoonish second string villain qualifies as expendable. On the other hand, comedian Garry Shandling virtually steals every scene that he has as a Congressman, particularly the last scene when he decorates Tony Stark for saving the country from Ivan. Sexy actress Scarlett Johansson shows up as Natalie Rushman, a mysterious undercover female commando who can handle herself skillfully in combat with men. Don Cheadle takes over the role of Lieutenant Colonel ""Rhodey"" Rhodes from Terence Howard. Rhodes takes one of Tony's Iron Man outfits because he doesn't want his friend to have a monopoly on world power. She replaces Pepper since Tony promoted Pepper upstairs. Favreau gives actor Samuel L. Jackson more screen time this time as Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but this character does little more than act as a press agent the eventual ""Avengers"" team-up movie. Unfortunately, this installment generates neither enough excitement nor irony to overwhelm its own inertia. Anybody who walks out before the long end credits conclude their tedious roll will miss a brief scene where our hero's new antagonist leaves his calling card in a huge pit.","

"erikabbott93","8 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is great, it has great action scenes, great actors and actresses for the carectors, and even very funny laughs. Robert Downy Jr. is Iron Man know one can pull off Iron Man like him. Mikey Rourke is a great villin he puts the whip in whiplash. I was a little disappointed that terrince howerd wasn't gonna be war machine but Don Cheadle pulled it off wonderfuly, he was the best choice for the role sine it wasn't howerd. Gwyneth Paltrow played a great role as pepper. Scarlett Johansson was hot, slick, and sexy, she was great for the guys to watch, and did a great role of black widow. Samule L. Jackson wasn't in Iron Man that much but he did to good as a nick fury character and think he can pull it off in the new nick fury movie thats supposed to be coming out in 2011. sam rockwell was a great actor in this movie he can really make you hate him, he can play a real ass whole. And the return of leslie bibb the sexy, hot, and slutty reporter from the first Iron man, shes only in it for about 10 to 20 min. but she was hot in that amount of time. This wa a great fun filled action triller great for the fans, go watch it and make sure to stay after the credits.","

"Quinoa1984","7 May 2010","Jon Favreau is out to make a good comic-book summer popcorn movie with Iron Man 2, no more no less. Anyone expecting the super dark out of this film lime the Dark Knight need venture along to something else (for one, Nolan's own Inception, but that's not here nor there). We once again have Tony Stark, the man and self-made legend, who is unique among superheroes as he 'came-out' as it were at the end of the first film as being in fact Iron Man. He now has to deal with other things, such as the government wanting, telling, him to hand over his technology for defense (""I have just privatized world peace"" is a keeper of a line), and his heart and soul Pepper Potts, and other new things, such as prickly competition in Justin Hammer, a hot red-headed secretary who can kick ass (and other things)... oh, and his father's legacy and the possibility that his technology for his heart may kill him.So as you can imagine, Stark is not quite at the top of his game. He can still kick ass as Iron Man - when the suit is in close proximity - but his nearly-close-to-deathness and still cleaning up after Stark company mistakes (such as the gnarly Russian cold-war leftover Ivan, aka 'Whiplash', played with gnarly gumption by Mickey Rourke), make him even more of an egotistical jerk than usual. This is what Favreau makes interesting: Stark has grown over time, but the obstacles in his path really knock him for a loop despite always putting a slightly self-deprecating and sarcastic face on things (or, other times, drunk-off-his-ass face on things, which brings Rhodey to become a ""War Machine""). What does a hero have to do to still be an extravagant billionaire out in public and not have to suffer fools trying to crib his technology? Stark's complexity carries the dramatic weight (if sometimes not quite as much as before; the midpoint becomes a little sluggish, though certainly not unwatchable when Sam Jackson comes on screen as Nick Fury), and Downey Jr still makes him one of the most fascinating and just plain f***ing fun superheroes around. Tony Stark is someone you'd love to hate if he weren't such a lovable louse. He's a womanizer and doesn't put on airs, but he deeply cares more about things that do matter than most, and Downey is able to balance out that snark and sense of humor of things with more heartfelt moments like with Paltrow's Pepper Potts (watch those scenes where he offers her the CEO position and then near the end when... well, don't want to spoil that, but they are touching). The new additions to the cast help a bit as well: Rockwell has some fun playing a one 1/2 dimensional slimeball of a politico, and Rourke gets to grit and act gnarly with the best of them as Whiplash. And Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Romanoff... woof.Oh, and the action is still high-flying and exciting and has some surprises in store for the audience (others like the 'ex-wife' actually, pleasantly, underwhelm as irony), and Favreau is able to still manage getting in the humorous beats in those intense moments of action and daring-do. While not every joke hits or line connects, enough do to keep things going on; Favreau even has fun with himself in the Happy Hogan role in a fight scene that is just about perfect for him. The biggest problem though is the allusions - no, wait, flat out references - to the upcoming Avengers movie and other tie-ins to the Marvel universe. In the past it was a little more subtle (a SHIELD joke near the end of the first one, and a cameo of Stark in Incredible Hulk notwithstanding), and in this they are crowbared in a few scenes, albeit one involving Captain America is very funny.But look, this isn't Shakespeare, and it isn't necessarily trying to up the ante on the first one (though, frankly as one of the truly great comic-book adaptations, what could), but it kicks some ass and gets some laughs and assembles a top-shelf cast for a script that's worth the time and money and energy. It's a nice kick-start: the summer of 10 is here.","

Are they covering their bases in case they can't afford to pay Downey for the Avengers or what? Iron Man and/or The Avengers will NOT work without Stark/ Downey! His charisma is what made these movies the best Marvel movies ever made. You can't have the Avengers without Iron Man... you can't have Iron Man without Tony Stark... you can't have Tony Stark without Robert Downey!I sincerely hope Downey signs on for a prominent role in the Avengers, otherwise it will be severely diminished. Casting makes a movie. Downey was perfectly cast and adds as much to his character as Halle Berry took away from Storm, Affleck took away from Daredevil, and Ioan Gruffudd took away from Mr. Fantastic.Not as good as the first, but still the second best Marvel film ever made.","

"mack-50","9 May 2010","The anticipation to see the follow-up to 2008's Iron Man was quite high and it was hard to expect anything less than sheer awesomeness. Fortunately the movie delivered in spades and did not fail to impress on most accounts. The Cast: For starters, Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as Tony Stark, the billionaire, egocentric, narcissist CEO of Stark Industries. While initially skeptical before the first movie I could not think of anyone better suited for this roll now and RD Jr. is easily one of the most watchable actors in film today. Gwenyth Paltro is back as Pepper Potts and while her role seems slightly subdued in this film it certainly isn't due to her lack of acting skill which is, as always quite in tact. Seeing Scarlett Johanssen as the striking Natalie Romanoff however was an incredibly welcome treat. I can't help but fall in love with Scarlett nearly every time I see her on the big screen and she performed admirably in the film with a few outright stunning karate style ass-kicking stunts. Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Rhodey and when the change was first revealed I wasn't happy, but if there is any ONE good replacement it would have to be Cheadle. Rhodey's character is a bit cold and calculated even though he is supposed to be close friends with Stark. Sam Rockwell appears in Iron Man 2 as Justin Hammer. A nemesis to Tony Stark on the business front and Sam is always great to watch although somewhat annoying which is what the film was gunning for in his character. I've been a fan ever since I saw him in McG's Charlie's Angels as the evil Sam Knox. I could go on with the cast of characters like Mickey Rourke playing the evil Ivan Vanko, Samuel L. Jackson as Shield's Nick Furty, Gary Shandling as the annoying Senator Stern and even some great cameo's by DJ AM (rest his soul), CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Bill O'Reilly as the Fox no-spin master himself and even G4's super sexy Oliva Munn who were all an absolute pleasure to watch and even more so if you keep your thumb on current pop culture. But I digress.The Story: This time we see Tony Stark suffering from his chest mounted power source that is literally poisoning him from the inside and there is seemingly no cure. A great plot thickener to be sure but not before Tony and Iron Man have a chance to discover there is also another bad boy of technology on the block in the name of Ivan Venko. Apparently the son of an inventor that Tony Stark's father worked with briefly before getting into a nasty bit of business and ending badly many years ago which brings Ivan back for furious vengeance against Stark and team and eventually going to work for Hammer who is trying to secure a contract with the US government for futuristic arms development. All the while the US government is trying to ""acquire"" Iron Man technology for ""safe keeping"" should the nation need to use it while Mr. Stark is off on one of his wild weekend long parties. The part where congress calls in Tony Stark to testify on why he should give up Iron Man technology to the government is particularly entertaining. Issues: While the movie was great in my opinion it was not without a few issues of note. I found it interesting that Ivan Venko arrived at the race in Monaco in order to confront Iron Man yet it was a last minute change that even brought Tony out onto the track. Quite a large oversight for such a high profile movie. Also with regards to Tony Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts. Throughout the movie there was little to no sexual tension or overt attractions between the two. However at the very end they seemed to unnaturally pin the two together for something more serious. It seemed rushed and out of place in my opinion. Closing: With that said I'll leave the rest to imagination and you to see the movie to discover the great storyline, incredible action sequences and entertaining one-liners throughout and let's not forget about the ass kicking sound track officially consisting of all classic AC/DC but with snippets of other great tunes such as Daft Punk's Robot Rock played during an appropriate fight scene between Iron Man and.Oh well lets just save that for the movie shall we? If you enjoyed the first Iron Man I'm fairly certain Iron Man 2 will not disappoint you in the least. Enjoy!","

"blackberrybabe","1 May 2013","Being a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr., I naturally want to see everything that he is in. When I found out that he was Iron Man, I was intrigued and excited. I loved the first movie and eagerly anticipated the second one. When it came out, I was worried it would not live up to my expectations.I needn't have worried; the movie surpassed my expectation. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect. I just wanted the relationship between Stark and Potts to develop more. I liked that there were links to other Avenger characters, such as the mention of New Mexico and a drawing of the Tesseract. At the time, of course, I didn't make the connection because I hadn't seen any of the other Avenger movies. Now that I have, I look for the hints that are cleverly placed in all films.Robert Downey Jr. once again shines as Tony Stark. You see his vulnerability in this one when he realizes that the palladium heart he uses to stay alive is also what is killing him. Downey, of course, makes Tony real. He makes mistakes and then tries to recover from them. He is arrogant and egotistical, humble and scared. Downey allows Tony to show all of these emotions without making him a caricature. He really is one of the greatest actors of his generation.Returning as Pepper Potts is Gwyneth Paltrow. As in the first film, Potts does not have a lot to do but still needs to be rescued. Paltrow plays Potts well; at one point I wanted to throw something at her for the way she treats Tony. I get that she's irritated by his behavior, but the fact that he's trying to make amends should count for something yet she doesn't think so. Paltrow is perfect.Don Cheadle takes over the role of Colonel James Rhodes from Terrance Howard. I really wanted to hate Cheadle; Howard was so perfect as Rhodey. However, Cheadle did a great job and at times, I forgot that Howard didn't return to the sequel. We get to see Cheadle suit up in this one as War Machine and I loved when both he and Stark teamed up for battle.Academy Award winner Mickey Rourke is Ivan Vankov, a Russian determined to get revenge on Tony for what Howard Stark did to his father. Rourke is convincing as Vankov, carrying the Russian accent perfectly and makes you believe that he really is Vankov. One interesting thing to note is that the beautiful bird that was in the film was at the request of Rourke. He wanted Vankov to have a human side and have love for something, and so the bird was added into the film. This was a risky move that works. Although you know that he's up to no good, you can't help but like him when he requests that his bird is with him when he works.The rest of the cast is rounded out with Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, Clark Gregg and Samuel L. Jackson. Of course, each is wonderful in their roles. It was nice to see Jackson and Gregg return as their characters from S.H.I.E.L.D. and introduce us to Johansson as well. There's a bit of a hint as to who she really is early in the film when she takes Happy down in a boxing move, but you have a tendency to forget that until her alter ego of Natasha Romanov is revealed.Graphics play a huge part in this movie and rightfully so. Tony is an innovator and a step ahead of modern technology. It makes me hope that everything he uses will eventually be in every household in the world. Audi also makes a guest appearance when Tony drives a few of his cars in the film.Many people were worried that Iron Man 2 wouldn't be as good as the first one, but those worries were quickly put to rest. For a sequel, it is everything it should be. Here's hoping the bar is raised even higher in Iron Man 3.","

"TheEmulator23","10 May 2010","This was extremely mediocre in the biggest way a film can be. The story. It's barely there at all. Everything about the film was top notch, the acting the special effects, the set pieces etc. However it just goes to show that unless you have a good story & a good script, there is something missing. You never get invested in the story even for a second. That was what made the first film what it was, a really fun & engaging storyline. This had absolutely none of that whatsoever. It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't good. The word of mouth on this will spread (badly) & I would be shocked if this makes as much as the first film which relied on the excellent word of mouth to make it such a successful & very well reviewed film. It seemed like they really should have made the script the most important part of the film. Mickey Rourke did the best he was given, but he just wasn't an interesting/scary bad guy at all. Especially comparing to Jeff Bridges of the first film. I wish people would stop comparing this so much to the first film & stop rating it so high based on that film. If you hadn't seen the first, it doesn't hold up well as a standalone film. In fact if this was the first ""Iron Man"" It would be doubtful we would have seen a second film. On a good note Robert Downey Jr. is good to an extent, but they should have let his own personality shine through even more as he is the reason people love the character. Unless you're a die hard ""Iron Man"" fan you will find little to want to watch this more than once.","

"deepthinker566","30 June 2010","After see the Iron Man 2 years ago, there was a sequel to it, and I was very exhilarated after I saw it.Before I get to the review let me say this right here, If you HATE Transformers/Iron Man 2, YOU'RE AN IDIOT. As of now, the Golden Raspberry Awards is the worst thing that the movie industry has ever done. Seriously?!! Transformers 2 was the best movie of 2009, hell, I even got the DVD for my birthday!!! And you scumbags out there didn't even pick ""Old Dogs"", ""Land of the Lost"", ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"", or ""All About Steve"" hell, even Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 for that award!! But no, you're just too stupid to do so and picked my all-time favorite movie.The people of the Razzie Awards are just a bunch of lame ass people who have no acclaim for movies. I'm pretty sure that Michael Bay threw his Razzie Award in the trash can for what they've done.I know a lot of Transformers fans out there in the world are probably mad from what they've seen. They'll probably rant on them pretty soon if they get a chance to do so. I mean, Transformers 2 for Worst Picture? That is just sad. Transformers 2 haters can shut up for a while. I prefer this movie than ""Alvin and the Chipmunks 2"" because that movie has one of the worst endings I've seen.Seriously, the Razzie Awards sucks now, because of this. I'm going to give them two middle fingers for saying that. Transformers 2 gets two thumbs up as well.The bottom line: Golden Raspberry Awards SUCK!!!!! Now, it's time for the Iron Man 2 review.It stars Robert Downey Jr., Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L Jackson, Mickey Rourke etc.With the world now aware of his dual life as the armored superhero Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military. Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts, and James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes at his side, must forge new alliances - and confront powerful enemies.I actually enjoyed this movie more than Alvin and the Chipmunks 2.Both Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Iron Man 2 are AWESOME.After that long rant and a short review, the movie's a must-see.Iron Man 2 gets 10 stars.","

"jboothmillard","22 May 2010","Iron Man was such a huge hit that a sequel was obviously on the cards, but the you want avoid making it look or feel the same, but it does, from director Jon Favreau (Elf). Basically the whole world now knows that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is Iron Man, and he faces a lot of concern from the government about the thought that the suit may be considered as a weapon. Strict on keeping his invention, Tony puts his personal secretary, who has a crush on him, Virginia 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) in charge of Stark Industries to keep things afloat. Meanwhile, a new enemy has emerged, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), or Whiplash he is referred (in the comics), with his Stark based technology knowledge and plans to help him. He has created a new weapon based on whips and electricity, and with the help of revenge-seeking rich bastard Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) he is able to build a much more destructive design. The only other stuff going on really is financial difficulties at Stark Industries, something called S.H.I.E.L.D. which Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) is a member of who can help Tony cure his failing chest shrapnel cure, and Tony's friend Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) donning another Iron Man suit and becoming War Machine. Also starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Paul Bettany as Jarvis, Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart and and look out for a cameo by Stan Lee. The action is still okay, the special effects are still tip tip, and the performances still have some merit, but it just feels too much like you've seen it all before. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!","

"lesleyharris30","5 May 2010","Iron Man 2 is a brilliant movie with a really good story line,a great cast and fantastic characters.Robert Downey Jr. returns for the second time as Tony Stark/Iron Man and he is as good as ever,I could never picture anyone else playing this character.The movie definitely isn't as good as the first Iron Man but it is still a very fresh sequel,fans of the characters and the comic books should enjoy this movie and also appreciate the the addition of Don Cheadle.Tony Stark quickly becomesa extremely well known when he reveals he is Iron Man,but a man who had a similar idea to Stark's invention decides to try an kill him with the technology he created.","

"charlesfoche","17 May 2010","Sequels always used to be worse th an firsts. Then 'Empire Strikes Back' kicked things in to another field.I loved 'Iron Man' . I can't go wrong with Jeff Bridges in it. Big performance real acting; bald with beard clearly the bad guy.Mickey Rourke is the new bad guy as Ivan Vanko. Expcept he has a reason to be resentful of Tony Stark and I liked this twist that the supposed bad guy actually had a real moral reason to fight the hero. Then again he doesn't come across as really wanting to kill Robert Downey Jnr which lessens the movie's impact.This twist is cut by a script that has been rushed together following 'Iron Man's success. Wish it had been better.","

"Robert_duder","16 July 2010","I think I could find a lot wrong with Iron Man 2. The first film really surprised me as being an amazing super hero origins film and I knew that a second movie or any future instalments would likely fall short. But for everything I could say I didn't like about Iron Man 2 I also think they did a pretty decent job for a high flying summer action flick. There is plenty of new and original ideas and perhaps the only glaring issue is that they take the amazing performance by a great actor and over do it a little bit making the hero of the story seem weaker in some ways but then that is also the basic premise of this sequel. Certainly every great hero needs a great villain and the villain they bring to the big screen for the sequel is quite simply amazing. I had low expectations of who they might put up against Iron Man for the sequel but I was truly blown away. Despite replacing a main character in the story they still managed to carry on terrific chemistry with the cast. Even though some of the characters are a little overblown this time around and the story doesn't have quite the same strength the action and special effects do bring it altogether nicely.Robert Downey Jr. takes his iconic role as philanthropist Tony Stark and Iron Man to new heights and goes through some real emotional moments. The problem is his breakdown in the film is overdone. You almost feel annoyed with his over the top antics to the point where he seems childish. He is still Tony Stark though and no one else could lead the character the way he does. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts in a more significant role this time around. She was terrific in the first film and is still great this time around. She is the grounding force to Downey's Stark and they still have great chemistry despite the story arc putting a wedge between them. This is a strong character for Paltrow. Don Cheadle takes the role of Stark's closest friend from Terrence Howard. I don't think the character was very well explored in the first film but they certainly give Cheadle more to work with and of course his own Super Hero persona as War Machine. War Machine is cool but is he entirely necessary...not in my opinion although that being said some of the great scenes in the film are featuring Cheadle as War Machine. Him and Downey also have great chemistry. Also new to the cast is Scarlett Johansson in a mostly introductory role to the future Avengers cast. She doesn't get much more than other than to allow Downey's Stark to hit on her mercilessly however she does get one incredible action scene where she stuns and amazes as she kicks her way through a group of baddies. I'm not quite aboard this Mickey Rourke craze train but I must say he is an awesome bad guy in the form of Ivan Vanko. They don't give him a lot of actual lines in the film (which is a bonus) and he looks awesome and kicks some serious ass. He is an awesome head villain for the film. Samuel L. Jackson and Sam Rockwell round out a supporting cast in good solid roles.While I don't believe the story is quite as good as the first the action is full throttle. There is some truly some great scenes that will put you on the edge of your seat. Jon Favreau is quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with in the directors chair. Iron Man is probably his best project to date. The cast and the over the top characters make this a high flying adventure. Certainly the first film was downright amazing and to follow it up with a solid entertaining second film is worth it. As much as I love a good sequel I think it would be smart to end the Iron Man saga here in favour of The Avengers which I hope they will do a good job with. 8/10","

"MLDinTN","27 February 2012","I finally saw this movie and it was basically a waste of 2 hours. To be fair, I just don't really care for the Iron Man idea, Spiderman and Batman are much better ideas.But there's just a lot of explosions and computer special effects. Plus Tony Stark is too weird and boring, the part with him getting drunk at the party and the colonel using one of the Iron Man suits was just boring and too long. The only part I liked was the first fight between Ivan and Tony. The electrically charged cables were a cool weapon. And Gwenyth Paltro is just a waste. She's so boring in these movies.FINAL VERDICT: I don't really like Iron Man any way, so I don't recommend it, but I'm sure a lot of people liked this.",NA
"tylerdburns-81322","2 September 2022","The third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, coming off the heels of the incredible Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, this film is an okay but disappointing third entry. The villain seems just thrown in the mix, with his motives never properly established. Casting once again is too of the line. The film is all over the place, with huge pacing issues and just generally scenes jump from one to the next in almost a random sense. Robert Downey Jrs. Character does have pretty good character development though, and his relationship with Gwyneth Paltrows character progresses nicely. Overall, it's simply an enjoyable, but disappointing entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with a very bland villain but good character development.",NA
"shido-san","14 November 2010","For me, 3.5 out of 5 translates into 7 out of 10, and no, I can't agree with that — I'd have to give this beast a 5 out of 5. Actually, a 9 out of 10, losing 1 point because it was only incredibly entertaining and had a plot line that held together. But, getting that 10, is hard.THERE WILL BE SPOILERS but I want to say this first! The acting was picture-perfect. This reminds me of Richard Donner's post-production remark, in gist: ""I guess Marlon Brando was worth the money."" Perhaps I shouldn't put quotes around that, but that is what he meant. It pays to have talent and these people so earned. I agree, a half-naked Whiplash didn't seem believable — Favreau and Rourke MADE it believable. The burning underneath relationship between fickle Tony and over-burdened Potts was believable. I really didn't believe Scarlet could pull off Black Widow.. but, boy, oh boy, did she pull off Black Widow, leaving me wanting more. I so wish I could say that about the former Spider-Man series! And, then there is Sam Rockwell's smarmy Stark competition, Justin Hammer.. very well played, sir. Sam is going places. We first saw him as the sneak in Charlie's Angels playing the victim to be revealed as the espionage snake, I saw him help beat a drug-wasted art celebrity to near unconsciousness in Basquiat. He's clearly doing things, be it Moon or otherwise. Very nice interplay within the cast. And Cheadle came through for us as the seamless replacement. Lessening my concern over the Edward Norton / Mark Ruffalo affair. Director Favreau, Happy, Foggy Nelson, +1, when are you going to return to your role in Dare Devil, I miss you (and that cast)! IT'S COMING and then there is the tiny role of Nick Fury.. actually, I am disappointed with the one-eyed Jackson in this. Maybe he isn't being given enough room to role but Marvel should have went with the original image.. no sense of Nick's toughness here.. I really hope he changes this in the Nick Fury Movie, if that ever happens.THE SPOILERS but blink and that is really a very small part. I loved the timing and the story here. IM2 supersedes 1!! And as I say this I know there are other opinions: the hard-ass action all the way folks won't agree. Fine. Look at the story: Iron Man's dad has a greater vision but his creative partner in the formulation of the ark reactor did too. In a sense, Iron Man is Howard Stark's creation but Whiplash was his partner's. There is the idea of connectivity and karma here: what goes around, comes around.. sins of the fathers kind of thing.. not developed enough to bring that solid 10 out of 10 but close. And Whiplash is brilliant and not dead at the end of the flick either. Captain America's unexplained shield. And, Thor's hammer. All on a time-line preceding The Incredible Hulk.I also loved the idea that Tony was dying from essentially metal poisoning via the battery implant (the alcoholic gig just wasn't palatable), that SHIELD is aware of it, and that Tony has issues with his past relationship with his father. Nice writing there! Frankly, Batman TDK does not hold up to this cinema. The writing, the acting, the film-making is better here. I really hope this is not Marvel's highest peak but just the start of a sustained plateau. Film-making is getting smarter.",NA
"forcesorcery","15 August 2010","Epic failure comparing to the Iron Man.Script/story is the problem. The story is chaos, most of the parts are meaningless. The Shield?

Later ignored the basic physics, how could he ""create"" a new elements without nuclear fission?The final battle is a joke.

"id_unplugged","7 June 2010","This is one of the dumbest and most painful to watch movies in it's genre today. There is so much potential here, that has masterfully been laid to waste here. Robert Downey Jr. played Tony Stark as the cliché arrogant, spoilt rich-kid in the first movie. In the second add morose, self-destructive dumbass to the list.Half of the movie is wasted on his mood swings and substance abuse. A little ::too close:: to reality.The chemistry between Pepper and Tony Stark --so does not work. The back-n-forth, him grovelling at her feet, is so old and preposterous it makes you cringe and hate both of them!. Scarlett Johansen's character is wholly redundant. It was plainly injected to add sex appeal and as it plays out, chubby Johansen looking up at the camera for 3 seconds, after ever take down, as if she is expecting the audience to cheer for her, is asinine shtick. Very painful.The only silver lining is Mickey Rourke's character. He is the only guy who seems to take this movie-making business seriously. He did full justice to the measly air-time they gave his character. Had he been given as much lines as... Pepper Potts, he would have stolen the movie from everybody.The movie is dull, slow, painful and insulting. Like getting your teeth pulled by a jeering dentist.",NA
"steppeck","9 June 2010","I enjoyed Iron Man 1. I enjoyed the fact that the main character was brought down to earth with a big nasty bump, confronted by the reality that he sponsors, and that sponsors his reprehensible lifestyle.That the sequel should suggest that this lifestyle he 'enjoys' is to be endorsed and aspired to, automatically places it into the category of artless social propaganda. It is, essentially a tale of unlikable people with the power of life and death over others, battling it out for the right for that power. Yes, Starks realises his dad loved him really, and that he really ought to cut back on the partying, knuckle down and join the 'team America' and and fight the 'bad guys'. Those bad guys? Well, we'll see who they are in Iron Man 3. Probably some other desperately impoverished group who are misled into believing that they can actually fight against the obscenely rich and powerful of this world. The fools. See Chris Morris' film 'Four Lions' for their story...",NA
"dvc5159","29 April 2010","Ah, yes, it's that time of that month again. Summer is here. The season for school holidays, fun in the sun, and cineplexes filled to the brim with bid-budget, CGI-laden blockbusters, most of them either superhero movies or sequels. ""Iron Man 2"" is a sequel to the 2008 superhero smash hit and while it delivers in spades action and well-executed CGI, I felt that it was not as great as the first.But first, the pros. Robert Downey, Jr. is still Tony Stark. He has an endless amount of charm, wit, suaveness and one-liners that makes him an extremely like-able whenever he's on the screen. Gwyneth Paltrow also returns as (un)lucky assistant Pepper Potts who again does a good job in contrasting Stark's happy-go-lucky personality with her straightforward behavior. New performers are here as well: Mickey Rourke is, as always, excellent as the villain, as per Sam Rockwell who gives a somewhat hilarious but smart villain, and Samuel L. Jackson just drips coolness whenever he appears.The special effects are very well-rendered and the action sequences are well-directed with high energy by Jon Favreau (also playing Happy Hogan, whom I am glad gets more screen time here). Also the music score by John Debney is suitable for the movie.However, the film has its cons as well. While Don Cheadle does an okay job at playing Rhodes, he just doesn't have that charm that Terrence Howard had in the first movie. To me, it seems as if he feels awkward in that role. Scarlett Johansson proves that she can kick ass if she really wants to (and looks gorgeous doing it at the same time), but her screen time is relatively short and unimportant compared to other characters.Also, the action in this sequel seems somewhat rushed, especially in the third act where it almost falls apart. It's as if screenwriter Justin Theroix doesn't really know how to end this thing, and as such we get quite the muddled ending. Also, I felt like the story took a detour from the realistic setting of the first to a more comic-book/sci-fi-like setting and some pretty cheesy villains if you ask me.Having said that, what was lost in action, was returned in the character exploration of Tony Stark. We see a great deal of character study in this film, more than in the first. Tony Stark is not perfect, he is not exactly an ideal superhero, and this is really proved in the middle of the film during his birthday party. We get to know more about Tony and what motivates his actions. We get to know what makes him tick, what makes him scared.So, overall, it's still fine entertainment, but those looking for it to exceed the original, or have high expectations, will be disappointed. I really wished it had more action as well as the character study (just look at ""The Dark Knight""). However, this summer is off to a good start, and I expect more entertaining fluff to come.I still have faith in the series. Bring on ""Iron Man 3"".Overall value: 7/10",NA
"m-p-carpenter","7 May 2010","unbelievable sequel that, in the eyes of this viewer, far exceeds the original. Though I don't dare compare the film to ""The Dark Knight"", in comparison, ""Batman Begins"" focused too much on telling us who Batman IS and less on an action adventure we can sit back and enjoy, much like the 2008 Iron Man. With the DK and Iron Man 2, we have passed all the introductions and we can really enjoy many more characters and action sequences (not to mention all the special effects!). Mickey Rourke was phenomenal and the only regret there was that his character did not appear in the movie MORE! Midnight showing was totally worth it, especially with all the little HINTS you can pick up if you know enough about other superhero characters that may be involved with upcoming story lines.",NA
"chjx","7 May 2010","Well, I'm sure some opinions will differ from mine, but I thought Iron Man 2 was even better than the first one, and I consider that to be, if not the best, one of the best movies ever made in the super-hero genre.Good acting (OK, nobody expects any Academy Awards here), decent plot/story line, and GREAT action sequences and special effects.When I first learned that Robert Downey Jr. had been cast for the role of Tony Stark in the original movie I thought...what? He, of course, proved me very wrong in both that movie and this one. And, while the abrupt shift from Terrence Howard to Don Cheadle for the Rhodey character was a little disconcerting, I got over it pretty quickly.Bring on the Thor, Avengers, and Captain America movies...do those folks at Marvel know how to turn a buck or what!",NA
"Jona1988","30 April 2010","Some quick thoughts on one of the movies I was looking most forward to this year. I loved the first Iron Man movie, but I found the sequel massively disappointing.The main problem is the story. It's must be described as a mess. It has the same problem as Spider-man 3 containing way to many characters with different plot lines making the story crowded. But also is the fact that simply none of the plot lines are interesting and it all feels so thin. Superhero movie aren't expected to have any award winning writing but if I compare to the first Iron Man this is shockingly weak. I mean this is directed by the guy who did the first one. Iron Man 2 has this lack of effort feel to it. The action scenes feel likewise. Would not say bad just dull and rushed. The acting also is so and so. The returning ones are great but the new ones not so much. Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell do OK i guess but their characters are just badly written. Far from their best performances. And the character Black Widow just feels shoehorned into the plot. I can't blame Scarlett Johansson for how bad I felt her character was. Another problem I want to mention is that the film contains a lot more and actually to much humor compared to the first movie. There should be jokes but here I feel they step over the line from funny to silly. This highly anticipated superhero sequel ends up as a rushed, uninspired and way to childish action-comedy.",NA
"Leofwine_draca","23 September 2013","IRON MAN 2 is a surprisingly decent sequel and a definite improvement over the silly, convoluted and somewhat childish original. Try as I might, I could never get into the first film's storyline involving a supremely arrogant Robert Downey Jr. and a ""what's he doing here?"" Jeff Bridges. The effects were unremarkable and the story bogged down in the ""origins"" nonsense that made it a chore to sit through.This sequel gets into full stride straight away and explores what it's like to bear the weight of responsibility. Stark is by now an alcoholic who ends up alienating most people around him, and I just found the whole thing more involving and engaging. There isn't an overwhelming about of action, which is great, because the two set-pieces that do occur (the race track showdown and the extensive climax) are all the better for it.Downey Jr. remains a bullish and unlikeable character, but there are more interesting supporting roles here for Don Cheadle and, in particular, Mickey Rourke, who's enjoying something of a career renaissance as of late and who has a ball as the crazed, whip-wielding bad guy (and I absolutely LOVE those whips!). It's not perfect, because Gwyneth Paltrow is still a drippy irritant and director Jon Favreau needs to learn humility after casting himself in a supposed comedic part, but the presence of special agents Samuel Jackson and, in particular, Scarlett Johansson, add to the entertainment value immeasurably. I just we could have had more Kate Mara...",NA
"sleepyhead_zzz","7 May 2010","So I'm the type of person who rates movies based on their enjoyability and how much I personally enjoyed them. Like, I would give Sherlock Holmes a 9.5/10 while I'd give Avatar a 8/10 just due to expectations and enjoyability.Anyway, Iron Man 2 was A LOT OF FUN. I loved it. I went to the midnight premiere and was laughing during the entire movie. Of course, I had read the reviews anticipating a kick-butt beginning and ending with a slow middle, but that's not how the movie was for me. IM2 was one fun ride that rarely let up on its humor. Compared to IM, I don't know. I think it's just as good--if not better (WHAT?! Yes, I don't agree with the majority of IMDBers)--but it's different so I don't know how to compare.The cast did a spectacular job. RDJ was top-notch, him and Gwyneth had delightful chemistry, Rourke was crazy intimidating, Rockwell was good over-the-top funny, Scarlett was kick-butt, and special shout-out to Favreau who was funny. Cheadle was fine...I wasn't particularly amazed by his performance, but then again, I wasn't by Howard's either.One slight blip in the movie was that there were a lot of characters added so the movie had a bunch of plot lines. I didn't notice while watching the movie, but after watching it, I wish they had just stuck to one or two characters and elaborated on their story lines.Anyway, IM2 was a great movie. I loved it.",NA
"davidmvining","25 November 2019","Tony dealing with death? Vanko exacting revenge for his father's death? Tony figuring out how to operate alongside the United States military? This film is just so jam packed full of stuff that nothing ever develops, everything fights with everything else for screen time, and all we really get is a jumbled experience.In the wake of Tony Stark revealing himself to the world to be Iron Man, Ivan Vanko is by his father's deathbed in Russia. Papa Vanko had once worked with Tony's father to develop the Arc Reactor (the big version of the shiny thing in Tony's chest) before being deported back to Russia. Driven by revenge, Vanko replicates the miniature arc reactor (that apparently only he and Tony can create) in his crappy Russian living space and disappears for half an hour. Meanwhile, Tony is dealing with mystery disease that's tied to his chest piece and poisoning his blood somehow. This will drive Tony and his motives for about half the movie when it will magically get cured and never mentioned again. He's running an Expo, or something, which allows him to be a rich eccentric and go to Monaco where he will drive a Formula 1 car in the Gran Prix. It is here that Vanko reveals his Iron Man inspired whips and nearly kills Tony before promptly getting captured by police.Justin Hammer, the CEO of a competitor to Stark Industries for defense contracts (does Stark still supply the military or not?), frees Vanko from prison because he is an idiot who thinks he can control a maniac who walked onto the tracks of a Formula 1 race and used electrified whips to try and kill Tony Stark. He tasks Vanko with creating Hammer version of the Iron Man suit. Vanko doesn't do this and instead creates drones. Hammer, who is an idiot, decides that this is cool after a quick freak out that means nothing.Tony, meanwhile, is suffering from his magical disease and breaking down emotionally. This is easily the best part of the movie. It's almost, at most, 30 minutes long in a 2-hour film. The reasons for his disease are ill-defined and the resolution is pure cheating, but Tony's descent into despair works. He's on top of the world on the outside, but he's hiding his decline from everyone. It's eating him up and he become increasingly self-destructive to the point that he dons his Iron Man suit at his birthday party and gets into a fight with his best friend Rhodey who stole another Iron Man suit for the conflict (why Tony keeps power supplies in the suits when they actually go in his chest I do not know). Nick Fury shows up, gives Tony a ""temporary"" cure to his disease that wipes away the disease instantly before Tony creates an impossible new element in a scene even more ridiculous than the similar scene in the first film where he made an arc reactor in a cave. Welp! He's not dying anymore! That's story's done! And the movie goes on for another 40 minutes.This is all setup for the final confrontation at Tony's Expo where Hammer reveals the drones, they promptly go on the rampage Hammer couldn't predict (because he is an idiot), and both Tony and Rhodey work to fight them. The actions scenes in general are well filmed and executed well, but much like Tony's central story, they are unmoored from the rest of the film. They're unrelated to Tony's actual story and the rest of the film around them.Downey Jr. is just as winning as Tony Stark as before, but the movie around him is even more of a mess than the first. The rest of the cast is fine, with a special nod to Sam Rockwell as Hammer who plays an idiot really well. Overall, though, the film is a disaster. Too muddled and filled with unrelated stuff, it never figures out how to tell any of its stories well. It's a mess.",NA

Some sort of mishmash of villains from the novels and a weak villain at that. Weak enemy robots. All they seem to be able to do is salute and get blown up! Weak nemesis in Justin Hammer. At least Scarlett Johansson was nice to look at. Weak final battle. The movie is just plain weak. We need Super Heroes not comedians! Batman still rules!",NA
"Theothervip","23 December 2010","Rating: *** out of 4.If the first IRON MAN was the origin story, than naturally its sequel would throw in the consequences. That doesn't make it a better film; in fact it's too much of it actually. But with the right balance of humor, thrills, special effects gimmicks, and more of Robert Downey Jr. as the narcissistic Stark, IRON MAN 2 is an adequate follow-up, even if it goes wildly out of control as it makes like SPIDER-MAN 3 and throws in as many subplots than it can handle.But unlike the latter, director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux (TROPIC THUNDER) keeps things better in balance and some of the sub-stories don't come quite as pointless as the one's in SPIDER-MAN 3. Still, if your gonna put Mickey Rourke as a cool bad guy named Ivan Vanko, you might as well give him better use than a filler for the grand finale. Vanko is the son of a disgraced Russian physicist who once collaborated with Tony Stark's father. Now, Vank demands revenge to lift his father's legacy. But the movie seems more interested in Stark's own problems with his life as mankind savior. A US senator (played hilariously by Garry Shandling) argues that Stark should hand over his technology to the US Military. Stark declines, taking him one step further to competitor Justin Hammer, who has tried endlessly to apply his own technological breakthroughs akin to Stark's and failing miserably. He now recruited Vanko, who failed in his first attempt to assassinate Stark, to build him a new breakthrough that would rival Stark and shame him in his own ""Stark Expo"" - Stark's annual unfoldment of his latest inventions. This gives more time for Rourke to play Ivan, not as a kick-ass bad guy, but as a comic relief spending time conversing with his pet Cockatoo. There's yet more plot: Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) gets a promotion as new CEO of Stark Industries, she gets a new assistant named Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) who's really more than who she is. Plus Stark is being considered to be a part of the Avengers Initiative by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, who extends his after-credit cameo in the first as a full-time role), and Stark's buddy Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (now played by Don Cheadle) gets his hands on one Stark's earlier Iron Man suit that gets a few modifications. Did I miss anything? Is IRON MAN 2 a crowded movie? Yes. It's not only over-plotted, it's cast reads like a who's who of who would people want to see in the latest Hollywood blockbuster (You want Scarlett Johannson in a tight rubber suit kicking butt? You got it!). But hey! In the heat of summer time, boredom can easily be cured by some explosive blockbuster fun, and IRON MAN 2 works fine. It's not as great as the first (which I never thought of as great as others think), and too much of it is a bid distracting (Stark is still front-and-center, but sometimes they tend to put him aside, then bring him back, and set him aside again), but it's a certified fun movie on a boring day.",NA
"Victreebong","1 September 2014","I really like the 2nd Iron Man. It doesn't have the captivation of the first entry, or the polarization of the third, or even the camaraderie of The Avengers, but it's easily the funniest of the bunch. It's more lighthearted than any of the other ones. Really, it's just Tony having fun while dealing with some minor personal demons.Robert Downey Jr. is as charismatic as always. We get to see more of the playboy in him and his character this time around. With the fortunate casting of Jon Cheadle (but unfortunate loss of Terrence Howard, thanks a lot Paramount!), Tony's kept in check and assisted by his supporting cast in a perfect choice. Jon Cheadle has come a long way from the accent façade of Ocean's Eleven. His resume just keeps growing and it's no surprise why. Gwenyth Paltrow, Clark Gregg and Jon Favreau are of course the returning cast and nail every line in every scene perfectly, deflecting Tony Stark's tendencies to hedonism in his self-inflicted tumultuous tantrums. Newcomers to the series, Scarlett Johanson and Mickey Rourke, are pure BAMF material; Mickey's character Whiplash (an otherwise little known anomaly in the comic book series) is especially well developed and superbly brought out in yet another shining example of Rourke's acting ability through nuance. I don't know if Rourke actually knows Russian, but you wouldn't be any wiser. But who really stands out in this film is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. Quite possibly the best supporting villain in any Marvel movie yet, Justin Hammer is the Lando Calrissian of Marvel entertainment, attempting to counter Stark Industries' outfitted models with his own inferior ""Hammerroids"". This is through the assistance of Whiplash in a baddie double team, and I'll stop there to avoid spoilers. What really makes Rockwell's character shine is his pompous naïve demeanor and aptitude for superiority by being a total mook! He's hysterical and obnoxious at the same time.---Maybe SPOILERS--- It's true that we see way more of Tony Stark than Iron Man, and some things could have been left out. Some things REALLY should have been left out. We don't need to be dumbed down by believing atoms are created by shiny blue laser beam in a basement man cave through the use of AC ducting. And a stable atom isotope previously undiscovered on a fifties' theme park replica? My IQ isn't in the double digits Marvel. But the interactions between the characters made the movie, so I prefer Tony's personal demons over an extra 15 minutes of Uni-Beams and blurry flight sequences.---End maybe SPOILERS--- Give the movie a rent if you haven't seen it already. If you have seen, maybe a repeat viewing. Remember, this is a COMICBOOK movie. No matter how many times that's said, people still don't understand that sentence.",NA

Whilst a sequel was always a risk of never matching the quality of the original, but most superhero films then to buck the trend with the first sequel.Six months after the events of the first film Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has become even more of a star because of his success as Iron Man. He made Stark Industries into a more ethical company and appoints his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as his new CEO. But there is trouble on the horizon: the US Senate demand that Tony hands over his Iron Man suit, the palladium that in the arc reactor that keeps him alive is also poisoning his blood, killing him slowly. There is also a deadly threat from Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who develops his own reactor and powerful suit so he can gain revenge against the Stark family. Vanko gets recruited by Tony's main rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to make an army of suits so they can take down Iron Man. With Tony slowly dying his behaviour becomes more erratic and he slowly drives his friends away, with his best friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) to steal one his suits, allowing War Machine to be born.Iron Man 2 has many good and bad elements, mostly good. Jon Favreau continues in the director's chair and adds to his cast of talented actors. Of course Downey and Paltrow were great together and had excellent chemistry. It was a shame that Terrence Howard left as Rhodey but the filmmakers found a great replacement with Cheadle, an excellent actor with a role that increases in this film. Rourke and Rockwell both made great villains, particularly Rourke as the intelligence and powerful Vanko. It was a shame he did not have more screen time as he was a great as the bad guy and shows he was not just a one dimensional character. Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson were also good additions (yes I know Jackson was in the end-credits scenes in Iron Man). But they screen time was limited. Favreau improves as an action director with better actions scenes like in Monaco and the special effects were brilliant like in the last film. But the end fight scene could have been a little more epic. Favreau makes the tone of Iron Man 2 a little more serious then Iron Man was (which was not bad at all), but he keeps a strong scene of fun in the film and there is a lot of humour throughout. He knows how to deliver a blockbuster. Plus there are plenty of hints toward the upcoming Avengers film, which is great to see for all the comic-book geek within all of us.But Iron Man 2 is not as strong as Iron Man. The screenplay by Justin Theroux is sadly a little too unfocused and had too many subplots. Some elements do not fit as well in the film and makes it a little too long and some felt forced like Rhodey's falling out with Tony. It also suffers from having too villains, confusing the audience on who they should focus on. What made Iron Man was because it had a simple story. But this is minor and the screenplay is solid for the most part.A very enjoyable start to 2010's summer season.",NA
"terryconway-69704","7 March 2022","Just a short review as it's taken me 12 years to catch up with this film, all thanks to Disney+ which I am loving. I loved Iron man and as I thought Iron Man 2 could not live up to this. Still think Robert Downey Jr is awesome but the surprise was Micky Rourke who was scarily magnificent as the adversary. As expected, special effects dominated but it was very well done. Will watch IM3 next weekend to see how it holds up.",NA
"roboperson","1 May 2010","Just came back from a 12'clock session of this movie, a lot of people were there but i got a good spot so here it goes....Plot: Now that the world knows about the identity of Iron Man, Millionaire Tony Stark denies the governments demands to try to produce more of his iron man suit for the military. Later, he will face even more deadly enemy, Whiplash. Also featuring new heroes: Natalie Rushman and Lt. Col. James Rhodes (who soon becomes War Machine.) I didn't expect much for this to top off the first one, it did well and this movie is more superior than other superhero movies we know today, such as: Spider-Man and X-Men. It just made these two movies look like toy dolls.The running time made me felt like i was watching it for days, but it was a long experience of greatness. Even, the CGI effects have really changed and it was something different to see for movies today.Overall: Iron Man is back in this overloaded Blockbuster full of exploding action, laughs and dazzling CGI.Grade: A",NA
"kunalkhandwala","10 May 2010","In the world of superheroes, all the Batmans, Supermans, Spidermans, Hulks and X-Men are constantly saving mankind from the cataclysmic forces of evil but in the world of movies, they have a far stronger nemesis to battle. Here, our Superheroes have to battle themselves. Meaning, The sequel has to outperform its predecessor. Mankind doesn't accept distinction as the Superhero's strength. It simply warrants comparison in order to find similarities. ""Oh the 'Dark Knight' was better than 'Batman Begins' and so too was 'Spiderman II' than 'Spiderman I' as was 'Incredible Hulk' than 'Hulk' but 'Superman II' was not as good as 'Superman' nor was any of the 'X-Men' better than their original"" etc etc.... While 'Spiderman' excelled with Sam Raimi and cute boy Tobey, 'Batman' had the darkness of Christopher Nolan and composure of Bale. But none of the superheroes have one critical factor that IronMan does....... ROBERT F****** DOWNEY JR.!!Jon Favreau has re-written the IronMan that Marvel created and Downey Jr. is solely responsible for the mayhem. This loose cannon character continues to be arrogant and foolhardy but at the same time, ultra cool at what he does. When it is his time to battle, he is an indefatigable Power Suit that can unleash more weapons from his arsenal than perhaps the US Army. With a shrapnel in his heart, Tony Stark is the flirtatious, hard-drinking, often careless billionaire who has no agenda against evil save the anxiety to obliterate them with his machinery. This IronMan needs no introduction and therefore, there isn't any discovery element to the sequel. Rather, there is an omnipresent threat of IronMan's technology coming into wrong hands; which it does. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the Russian physicist son of Anton Vanko (who partnered with Tony Stark's father before they had a fall out over a new technology) seeks revenge for his family's ruin and as Whiplash, he boldly and brutally interrupts the Monaco GP, challenging Stark for an impromptu duel. But Little did he know about that briefcase.... Stark's competitor, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) subsequently plans the escape of Vanko from prison to give him a playground where he could create an army that would overpower IronMan and make billions for Hammer Industries. Lt. Col. Rhodey (Don Cheadle) on the other hand is frustrated with Stark's carelessness but is bound by his friendship with him. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) still tries to balance Tony Stark's life, this time in a professional manner. We are also introduced to Marvel's Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson who plays Natalie Rushman, after looking at whom Stark's reaction is, ""I want one!"". She is employed by Nick Fury's (Samuel Jackson) S.H.I.E.L.D. that insists on IronMan becoming stronger for his adversaries while they plan an elusive saga of their own. With so much happening, one could get disengaged from the multiple characters and sub-plots but when your seat vibrates with the motion of the incoming IronMan flying into the screen for the climax, all you can do is whistle loud. Hammer's droid army (with a pre-programmed War Machine for Lt. Cl. Rhodey) attack IronMan all throughout the Stark Expo and the final showdown includes the bad-ass Whiplash at his formidable best. With AC/DC rocking in the background, the metal clanging is intense and exhilarating but one does wish for more of Whiplash especially with Rourke's excellent portrayal of the cunning Ivan Vanko. That said, Jon Favreau's sequel to IronMan is by no means a weak film. Performances are excellent, screenplay is absorbing and the action is explosive. It is clear that Favreau and Downey Jr. were simply enjoying themselves filming every scene. Downey's mischief, bravado, recklessness and ineptitude at being composed is altogether great fun to watch. He is as much fun outside his suit as he is inside it and that; is essentially Favreau's strength with this franchise. One cannot watch a full length film on Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker but Tony Stark??! Hell Yeah! While the newer characters and metal clanging may have displeased some fans of the 'Strictly Part 1' superhero movies, it does please comic book fans who get some introduction to the vast world of Marvel Comics with Whiplash, Black Widow, War Machine and.... uhh... never mind the after credits part.... These fans will be mighty pleased with the explosive action and characters while the rest who complaint have surely enjoyed Robert Downey Jr's entertainment. In the end, Stark's courtroom quote sums up the IronMan franchise's core strength and distinction: ""I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one"". 8.987 on a scale of 1-10.P.S. - Marvel fans: Stay put till after the credits....",NA
"honorhorror","10 May 2010","For the record, I gave Iron Man 1 a solid 8.4, for all the calibers and brilliance it delivered. Now with Iron Man 2 I gave it 7.3. Here are my reasons.1, The comedy still plays out pretty good with Downey's performance well utilized. Though some of the jokes were not as genuine as the original. Jon Favreau's approach of mixing sci-fi action with comedy still works, that's maybe the best news for fans and non-fans alike. Fortunately, they didn't follow Transformers 2's formula ""bigger the better"" or we will see some serious disasters. We still have these jaws-dropping dynamic action sequences which are well controlled and edited. The F1 track one was definitely one of the best crafted sci-fi fighting scenes, almost with a nostalgic feeling attached to it(light saber becomes light whip?)The climax is as big as one can imagine, but there comes the shortcomings. The first Iron Man was so charming to me mainly because as the movie processes, audiences were sucked into Tony's mind of tech geek and crazy stuffs. The scenes with Tony testing all the parts of his design were pricelessly detailed and looked genuine, like you can touch this technology and really invite it into your kitchen someday. But Iron Man 2 was too busy telling a more complex story, giving up all the opportunities exploring more facets of a crazy inventor. So on so forth.2, Terrence Howard was a better Rhodes, delivering charms by himself or charmed the audiences by being the buddy/nanny for Tony. Don Cheadle feels so serious that he never gave this charming awkwardness as heartfelt as Howard. Beginning with him, I perceived several problems with the supporting characters. Having Scarlett Johnson kicking human asses is a smart move, but she doesn't feel entirely immersed with the Iron Man atmosphere (especially when she fought with security guards while Tony fights robots). The villains, however, are weak. Hammer is supposed to be a genuine idiot, with too much ego and too little brain to be in the pentagon. His ideas are never fit into the Iron Man technology, that's what the movie has successfully illustrated with the climax. With that in mind, one can expect any goofy acts from him. Sadly, he spent too much time on the screen and made him almost like pretending to be an idiot(not mainly due to Sam Rockwell's performance). On the opposite, audiences may find Mickey Rourke much more delicious to watch. He's a total bad-ass with an attitude. Beneath that, he's also a heartless technology maniac(typical villain from Russia). Except the 124 minutes of running time had mostly underused him, portraying him to be someone largely inferior to every aspects of Iron Man(overly obsessed with whip-type of weapons,keep making the same mistake,etc.) Somehow I was expecting him to be the key of saving Tony, but I was wrong because the makers can't wait to get Nick Fury back on screen, and made the story logically plausible but not structurally remarkable.My friend, who also loves movies, remarked that he didn't want to see Iron Man 2 because it's ""too predictable as they bring some bad-ass robot toe-to-toe with Tony Stark and Tony wins"". I told him that's not the point of any popcorn movies or superhero movies, but I guess he's not totally wrong with this one. Nevertheless, Iron Man 2 still boasts with masterful polishing and will most probably be nominated best special effects by Oscar. Enjoy your party with Tony Stark!",NA
